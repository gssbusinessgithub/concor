Summary/Résumé/Resumen
Summary
In the last decade, social protection has emerged as a policy framework employed to address
poverty and vulnerability in developing countries. This report has two main aims: to provide an
overview of social protection, and to provide an assessment of its potential contribution to
addressing poverty and vulnerability in developing countries.
Section 1 provides some preliminary definitions and tracks the emergence of social protection
as a policy framework against a context of poverty and vulnerability trends in the 1980s and
1990s. Rising poverty and vulnerability following the 1980s in Latin America—known as the
“lost decade”—the financial crises in 1997 in Asia and the rapid economic transformation in
transition economies demonstrated the need to establish strong and stable institutions directly
concerned with reducing and preventing poverty and vulnerability. Social protection provides
a policy map, linking policy interventions to an understanding of poverty and vulnerability as
multidimensional and persistent.
Section 2 reviews poverty and vulnerability concepts and measures. It pays particular attention
to the growing influence of multidimensionality in poverty analysis. Duration and dynamics
are important dimensions of poverty and contribute to an understanding of vulnerability,
which is the likelihood that individuals or households would be in poverty in the future.
Research into multidimensional aspects of poverty and vulnerability has made a very important
contribution to the development and formulation of social protection.
Section 3 examines different approaches to social protection and traces them to underlying
development perspectives. There are different versions of social protection, emphasizing either
risk, rights or needs as the organizing concept. However, they all share common ground, an
important feature of which is the broader developmental role of social protection in developing
countries and its focus on (extreme) poverty reduction. This discussion opens a window on the
conceptual and ethical bases of social protection.
Section 4 examines trends and key issues in the development of social protection programmes
and policies in developing countries. The focus of this section is on social assistance, as the
component of social protection which addresses poverty most directly, but reference is made
where relevant to the other components of social protection, social insurance and labour market
regulation. The extension of social protection in developing countries has focused on social
assistance, as opposed to social insurance or labour market regulation. The section then traces
the main features of regional pathways in the development of social protection and assistance,
contextualizing the analysis of the resulting social protection programmes.
In the last decade and a half, there has been a great deal of innovation in social assistance
programmes, and a marked increase in their reach. Regular and reliable social assistance
programmes based around income transfers, but increasingly combining access to basic services
and investment in human development, now reach a significant proportion of those in poverty
in the South. Social assistance programmes are classified into four categories: (i) pure income
transfers; (ii) income transfers conditional on work; (iii) income transfers conditional on
investment in human capital; and (iv) integrated poverty reduction programmes. The section
discusses key features and objectives of these categories of programmes. Where impact
evaluation results are available, they show that new forms of social assistance have reduced
poverty and raised human development.
The extension of social protection in developing countries will require overcoming a number of
constraints, which are more acute for low-income countries. Among these constraints is
finance—a key barrier to the extension of social protection. The issue is long-term sustainability,
as developing countries are not in a position to finance the extension of social protection

iv

through payroll taxes that was crucial to the emergence of the welfare state in developed
countries. Alternative forms of resource mobilization will be needed. Capacity constraints are a
problem in low-income countries, but this is a more tractable issue than finance.
The final section summarizes the main points and discusses possible linkages to wider
institutional models. Examining the implications of following different social protection
pathways to reduce poverty and vulnerability and to establish long-term social protection
institutions remains an urgent question to be tackled by researchers. The likely impact on
poverty and vulnerability of the extension of social protection under way in developing
countries is not in doubt. Investment in social protection and social assistance can be extremely
effective in reducing current poverty and vulnerability, as well as poverty persistence across
time and generations. Countries with stronger social protection and assistance institutions show
lower rates of poverty and vulnerability, and are more resilient in the face of economic and
social transformation.

Résumé
Au cours de la dernière décennie, la protection sociale est apparue comme un dispositif
politique employé pour agir sur la pauvreté et la vulnérabilité dans les pays en développement.
Ce rapport a deux objectifs principaux: donner une vue d’ensemble de la protection sociale et
une évaluation de ce qu’elle peut apporter à la lutte contre la pauvreté et la vulnérabilité dans
les pays en développement.
Après quelques définitions préliminaires, la section 1 retrace l’apparition de la protection
sociale comme dispositif politique de lutte contre la pauvreté et la vulnérabilité dans les années
80 et 90. La montée de la pauvreté et de la vulnérabilité après les années 80 en Amérique
latine—connues sous le nom de “décennie perdue”—les crises financières de 1997 en Asie et la
transformation rapide des économies de transition ont démontré la nécessité de mettre en place
des institutions solides et stables, directement chargées de réduire et de prévenir la pauvreté et
la vulnérabilité. La protection sociale permet d’établir une carte, qui relie les interventions
politiques à une pauvreté et une vulnérabilité conçues comme multidimensionnelles et
persistantes.
Dans la section 2, l’auteur examine les concepts et mesures de la pauvreté et de la vulnérabilité.
Il accorde une attention particulière à l’influence croissante de la multidimensionnalité dans
l’analyse de la pauvreté. La durée et la dynamique sont d’importantes dimensions de la
pauvreté et contribuent à faire comprendre la vulnérabilité, qui n’est autre que la probabilité
pour les individus et les ménages de tomber dans la pauvreté à l’avenir. Les recherches sur les
aspects multidimensionnels de la pauvreté et de la vulnérabilité ont beaucoup contribué à
l’articulation et au développement de la protection sociale.
La section 3 est consacrée aux diverses approches de la protection sociale et aux conceptions du
développement dont elles s’inspirent et auxquelles elles se rattachent. Il existe différentes
versions de la protection sociale, organisées autour de la notion de risque, de droits ou de
besoins. Mais elles ont des points communs, ne serait-ce que le rôle que joue la protection
sociale dans le développement, plus important dans les pays en développement, et le fait
qu’elles tendent d’abord à faire reculer l’extrême pauvreté. Ce débat ouvre une fenêtre sur les
bases conceptuelles et éthiques de la protection sociale.
Dans la section 4, l’auteur examine les tendances et les grands enjeux des programmes et
politiques de protection sociale dans les pays en développement. Cette section porte surtout
sur l’assistance sociale, qui est de toutes les composantes de la protection sociale celle qui agit le
plus directement sur la pauvreté, mais renvoie aussi, s’il y a lieu, aux autres: l’assurance sociale

v

et la réglementation du marché du travail. Lorsque la protection sociale a été étendue dans les
pays en développement, elle l’a été principalement par le biais de l’assistance sociale, par
opposition à l’assurance sociale et à la réglementation du marché du travail. L’auteur décrit les
voies qu’ont suivies les régions pour développer la protection et l’assistance sociales, en en
relevant les principales caractéristiques, et analyse dans ce contexte les programmes de
protection sociale qui en ont résulté.
Depuis quinze ans, les programmes d’assistance sociale ont connu de nombreuses innovations,
et le nombre de leurs bénéficiaires a nettement augmenté. Réguliers et stables, ils reposent sur
des transferts de revenu mais combinent de plus en plus l’accès aux services de base et
l’investissement dans le développement humain et atteignent maintenant une proportion
importante des pauvres du Sud. Ils se rangent en quatre catégories: (i) les transferts de revenu
purs; (ii) les transferts de revenu subordonnés au travail; (iii) les transferts de revenu
subordonnés à des investissements dans le capital humain; et (iv) les programmes intégrés de
lutte contre la pauvreté. La section traite des principaux éléments et objectifs de ces catégories
de programmes. Là où leur impact a été évalué, les résultats de l’évaluation montrent que de
nouvelles formes d’assistance sociale ont fait reculer la pauvreté et progresser le développement
humain.
Pour étendre la protection sociale dans les pays en développement, il faudra surmonter diverses
contraintes, qui sont plus sensibles dans les pays à faible revenu. L’une d’elles est le
financement, qui est un obstacle de taille à l’extension de la protection sociale. L’enjeu est la
solidité financière à long terme, car les pays en développement ne sont pas en mesure de
financer cette extension par les impôts sur les salaires, qui ont joué un rôle vital dans
l’édification des Etats providence dans les pays développés. Il faudra user d’autres moyens
pour mobiliser des ressources. Les contraintes de capacité posent aussi problème dans les pays
à faible revenu, mais il est moins insoluble que celui du financement.
La dernière section résume les principaux points et traite des liens qui peuvent exister avec des
modèles institutionnels généraux. Les conséquences du choix de telle ou telle voie de protection
sociale pour le recul de la pauvreté et de la vulnérabilité et pour la solidité des institutions de
protection sociale restent un champ qu’il serait urgent que les chercheurs étudient. L’impact
probable sur la pauvreté et la vulnérabilité de l’extension de la protection sociale en cours dans
les pays en développement ne fait aucun doute. Investir dans la protection et l’assistance
sociales peut être un moyen extrêmement efficace de réduire la pauvreté actuelle et la
vulnérabilité, de même que la pauvreté qui a résisté au temps et s’est maintenue au fil des
générations. Les pays dotés de solides institutions de protection et d’assistance sociales ont des
taux de pauvreté et de vulnérabilité plus faibles et sont plus résilients face au changement
économique et social.

Resumen
En los diez últimos años, la protección social se ha convertido en el marco de política utilizado
para abordar la pobreza y la vulnerabilidad en los países en desarrollo. Este informe tiene dos
propósitos: ofrecer un panorama general de la protección social y evaluar su potencial
contribución para abordar la pobreza y la vulnerabilidad en los países en desarrollo.
La sección 1 contiene algunas definiciones preliminares y traza la historia del surgimiento de la
protección social como marco de política en un contexto de tendencias de pobreza y
vulnerabilidad en los años ochenta y noventa. La creciente pobreza y vulnerabilidad durante los
años ochenta en América Latina (conocida como la “década perdida”), las crisis financieras de
Asia en 1977 y la rápida transformación económica en las economías en transición demostraron
la necesidad de establecer instituciones sólidas y estables que se ocuparan directamente de

vi

reducir y prevenir la pobreza y la vulnerabilidad. La protección social ofrece un mapa de
políticas al vincular las intervenciones de política con el entendimiento de la pobreza y la
vulnerabilidad como conceptos multidimensionales y persistentes.
En la sección 2 se examinan los conceptos y las medidas de pobreza y vulnerabilidad. En esta
parte se presta particular atención a la creciente influencia de la multidimensionalidad en el
análisis de la pobreza. La duración y la dinámica son dimensiones importantes de la pobreza y
contribuyen a comprender la vulnerabilidad, que es la posibilidad de que las personas u
hogares caigan en situación de pobreza en el futuro. La investigación sobre los aspectos
multidimensionales de la pobreza y la vulnerabilidad ha hecho una importante contribución al
desarrollo y la formulación de la protección social.
La sección 3 se ocupa de los diferentes enfoques sobre la protección social y los vincula a las
perspectivas de desarrollo subyacentes. Existen diferentes versiones de la protección social, en
las cuales se enfatiza el riesgo, los derechos o las necesidades como el concepto organizador. Sin
embargo, todos estos enfoques comparten un terreno común, una de cuyas características
importantes es el papel más amplio de la protección social en el desarrollo de los países en
desarrollo y su énfasis sobre la reducción de la pobreza (extrema). Este debate abre una ventana
hacia la comprensión de las bases conceptuales y éticas de la protección social.
La sección 4 trata de las tendencias y problemas clave en el desarrollo de programas y políticas
de protección social en países en desarrollo. El énfasis de esta sección recae en la asistencia
social como el componente de la protección social que aborda la pobreza de forma más directa,
pero también se hace referencia, de juzgarse pertinente, a los otros componentes de la
protección social, la seguridad social y la regulación del mercado laboral. La extensión de la
protección social en los países en desarrollo se ha centrado en la asistencia social, más que en la
seguridad social o la regulación del mercado laboral. Esta sección describe las principales
características de las vías que han seguido las regiones en el desarrollo de la protección y la
asistencia sociales, contextualizando el análisis de los programas de protección social
resultantes.
En los 15 últimos años, los programas de asistencia social han sido innovados en gran medida y
su alcance ha aumentado de manera significativa. Los programas regulares y fiables de asistencia
social basados en las transferencias de ingresos, pero que en un grado creciente combinan el
acceso a servicios básicos y la inversión en el desarrollo humano, alcanzan ahora a una proporción
considerable de la población pobre del Sur. Los programas de asistencia social se clasifican en
cuatro categorías: (i) transferencias de ingresos propiamente dichas; (ii) transferencias de ingresos
condicionadas al trabajo; (iii) transferencias de ingresos condicionadas a la inversión en capital
humano; y (iv) programas integrados de reducción de la pobreza. En esta sección se examinan las
características y los objetivos clave de estas categorías de programas. En los casos donde se cuenta
con los resultados de la evaluación del impacto, estos muestran que las nuevas formas de
asistencia social han reducido la pobreza y aumentado el desarrollo humano.
La extensión de la protección social en los países en desarrollo pasa por superar una serie de
limitaciones, que son más agudas para los países de bajos ingresos. Entre estas limitaciones
destaca el financiamiento, un obstáculo clave a la extensión de la protección social. El problema
reside en la sostenibilidad a largo plazo, ya que los países en desarrollo no están en capacidad
de financiar la extensión de la protección social por medio de cotizaciones salariales, elemento
crucial para el surgimiento del Estado benefactor en los países desarrollados. Se necesitarán
formas alternativas de movilización de recursos. Las limitaciones de capacidad son un
problema en los países de bajos ingresos, pero es un problema más manejable que las finanzas.
La sección final es un resumen de los puntos principales y un análisis de los posibles vínculos
con modelos institucionales más amplios. El examen de las implicaciones de seguir senderos de
protección social diferentes para reducir la pobreza y la vulnerabilidad y establecer
instituciones de protección social a largo plazo sigue siendo un tema urgente que los

vii

investigadores deben abordar. No se pone en duda la posible repercusión de la extensión de la
protección social actualmente en curso en los países en desarrollo sobre la pobreza y la
vulnerabilidad. La inversión en protección social y asistencia social puede ser extremadamente
eficaz para reducir el nivel actual de pobreza y vulnerabilidad, así como la persistencia de la
pobreza a lo largo del tiempo y de generaciones. Los países con instituciones más fuertes de
protección social y asistencia oficial muestran tasas inferiores de pobreza y vulnerabilidad, y
son más resistentes ante la transformación económica y social.

Introduction
In the last decade, social protection has emerged as a policy framework employed to address
poverty and vulnerability in developing countries. A range of factors signal the rise to
prominence of social protection. International development organizations, especially agencies
within the United Nations family, have adopted and adapted social protection strategies and
policies.1 A growing number of national governments in the developing world are developing
and adopting national social protection strategies within their poverty reduction planning.
There is a rapid escalation in the number and coverage of social protection policies and
programmes being implemented in developing countries.2 There is also rising interest in social
protection among development researchers, development research institutes, and higher
education.3
This report has two main aims: first, to provide an overview of social protection, and second, to
provide an assessment of its potential contribution to addressing poverty and vulnerability in
developing countries.
The report consists of four main sections. Section 1 provides some preliminary definitions and
tracks the emergence of social protection as a policy framework against a context of poverty and
vulnerability trends in the 1980s and 1990s. Section 2 reviews poverty and vulnerability
concepts and measures, noting the growing influence of multidimensionality in poverty
analysis. Section 3 examines different approaches to social protection and traces them to
development perspectives emphasizing risk, needs and rights. This discussion opens a window
to the conceptual and ethical bases for social protection. Section 4 assesses existing social
protection programmes and policies in developing countries against poverty reduction
objectives. The focus of this section is on social assistance, as the component of social protection
which addresses poverty most directly, but reference is made where relevant to the other
components of social protection, social insurance and labour market regulation. The section
distinguishes regional pathways in the development of social assistance, contextualizing the
analysis of social protection programmes which follows. A discussion of social protection
expenditure and financing closes this section. Finally, a conclusion gathers together the main
points of the paper and speculates on possible approaches linking social protection to broader
institutional models.

1. The Emergence of Social Protection in Developing Countries
Social protection is rapidly becoming a key component of development policy. This section
provides a description and definition of social protection, identifies the key policy drivers and
describes the scope of social protection as a policy framework.

What is social protection?
In the work of the International Labour Organization (ILO), social protection is associated with
a range of public institutions, norms and programmes aimed at protecting workers and their
households from contingencies threatening basic living standards. Broadly, these can be
grouped under three main headings: social insurance, social assistance and labour market
regulation. Social insurance consists of programmes providing protection against life-course
contingencies such as maternity and old age, or work-related contingencies such as
unemployment or sickness. Social assistance provides support for those in poverty. Normally,
social insurance is financed from contributions by workers and their employers, whereas social

(IADB 2000; United Nations 2000; ADB 2001; ILO 2001; World Bank 2001a; HAI 2003; DFID 2005).

assistance is tax-financed. Finally, labour and employment standards ensure basic standards at
work, and extend rights to organization and voice. These institutions have been fully
established in developed countries, but in developing countries their development has been
uneven.
In the 1990s, social protection underwent an important transformation, especially in the context
of developing countries. Against a background of economic crises, structural adjustment and
globalization, social protection in developing countries has increasingly come to describe a
policy framework for addressing poverty and vulnerability. It can be defined as “public actions
taken in response to levels of vulnerability, risk, and deprivation which are deemed socially
unacceptable within a given polity or society” (Conway et al. 2000:2).
There are several features distinguishing the emerging paradigm in developing countries.4
There, social protection has a strong focus on poverty reduction and on providing support to
the poorest (de Haan 2000; Barrientos and Hulme 2005), whereas in developed countries the
emphasis of social protection is on income maintenance and on protecting living standards for
all (but especially workers). In developing countries, the main emphasis of social protection is
on addressing the causes of poverty, and not simply its symptoms (World Bank 2001a). The
focus of social protection is not restricted to compensating those in poverty for their income
shortfall, but aspires to have a broader developmental role.5 The emerging social protection
paradigm in developing countries is also distinguished by a focus on risk and vulnerability.
This is based on the understanding that a primary cause of persistent poverty is to be found in
the constraints faced by the poor in taking advantage of economic opportunity, which can be
explained, to a great extent, by their vulnerability to the impact of economic, social and natural
hazards. In the absence of social protection, hazards impact directly on living standards. In
addition, they motivate risk-averse behaviour among those in poverty, which is detrimental to
their long-term welfare, for example, responding to financial crises by taking children out of
school or economizing on primary health care. A concern with protecting households against
the direct effects of hazards is common to social protection in developed and developing
countries, but a concern with minimizing rational but detrimental responses to vulnerability by
those in poverty is central to the extension of social protection in developing countries.
As a policy framework addressing poverty and vulnerability in developing countries, social
protection is a key component of development policy. The broader developmental role of social
protection in developing countries involves three main functions: (i) to help protect basic levels
of consumption among those in poverty or in danger of falling into poverty; (ii) to facilitate
investment in human and other productive assets which alone can provide escape routes from
persistent and intergenerational poverty; and (iii) to strengthen the agency of those in poverty
so that they can overcome their predicament (Barrientos forthcoming).6

Trends in poverty and vulnerability
An important factor in the spread of social protection in developing countries was the rise in
poverty and vulnerability which followed crises and structural adjustment in the 1980s and
1990s, which then persisted in the recovery phase. Global estimates of poverty incidence based
on $17 a day show a slight increase in headcount poverty in 1990 compared to 1987 (from 28.3
per cent to 29 per cent) and a subsequent decline in 1996 (to 27 per cent) (Bigsten and Levin
2005). Regional estimates of poverty incidence based on national poverty lines show a stronger
rise in poverty incidence, and a more gradual decline. Figure 1 below shows estimates of
4 The distinctions drawn reflect positive (what is) as opposed to normative (what should be) concerns. Some suggest that a focus on

poverty and vulnerability reduction has the effect of narrowing down the options for the extension of social protection in developing
countries. This is a separate issue, which will be tackled towards the end of the paper.
5 This is a very important point which is developed in more detail below.

poverty and indigence headcount rates for Latin America.8 By 2005, headcount poverty was just
below the 1980 level estimate, but had remained above it throughout the intervening period.
The trend reflected the acute impact of crises and adjustment in the “lost decade”, and the
persistence of poverty in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Comparable estimates of vulnerability and vulnerability trends are sadly lacking.9 Vulnerability
refers to the chances of staying in, or falling into, poverty in the future.10 It reflects the absence
of protection. Estimates of the proportion of the labour force in Latin America not contributing
to social insurance schemes could help track trends in vulnerability. Workers failing to
contribute to social insurance schemes are primarily informal workers who are highly
vulnerable. As can be seen from figure 2 below, the share of dependent workers not covered by
social insurance shows a rising trend in the 1990s and 2000s, consistent with a rise in
vulnerability in the region.

The 1997 financial crisis in East Asia had a profound impact on poverty and vulnerability in the
region. In Indonesia, for example, poverty headcount rates almost doubled as a consequence of
the financial crisis (Suryahadi and Sumarto 2003). In South Asia and Africa, estimates of
poverty headcount appear to have stagnated, poverty estimates based on the $1 a day were
stuck at the mid-40 per cent level during the 1990s (Bigsten and Levin 2005). The rapid rise in
poverty and vulnerability in the transition countries of Central Europe and Asia during
structural adjustment is well documented (Lanjouw et al. 1998).11
8 In Latin America households are classified as indigents if their income is below that required to purchase a basic food basket.

Households are classified as poor if their incomes fall below what is required to purchase a basic basket of food and non-food items.
Roughly, the poverty line is twice the indigence line.
9 This section is highly focused on Latin America as data on poverty and vulnerability in this region has been estimated on a consistent

basis and across time. Consistent estimates for poverty and vulnerability using national poverty lines are lacking for other regions; this
applies especially to informality which is used here as a proxy for vulnerability.

An emergent policy framework for developing countries
Public assistance programmes and other forms of safety nets, scarcely available in developing
countries at any rate, proved inadequate to deal with the rapid rise in poverty and
vulnerability. Short-term safety nets worked with varying degrees of success,12 but were never
intended to establish the institutional structures to ensure anything more than short-term
palliatives.13 The impact of the crisis and adjustment on public agencies opened the way for a
growing involvement of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the delivery of poverty
reduction programmes. Social funds provided the institutional basis for the engagement of a
wider range of stakeholders in demand-led developmental projects. However, few social funds
reached the scale needed to have a significant impact on poverty, and their autonomy from
public agencies—which was a key advantage in the initial stages of their development—made it
difficult to support the strengthening in their capacity later on.
Assessments of the responses to the crises and adjustment concluded that addressing poverty
and vulnerability required stronger, coordinated and permanent institutional structures, which
could develop a capacity to respond to crises when these occurred.14 This is the context in which
social protection emerges as a policy framework.

2. Poverty and Vulnerability: Concepts, Measures and Dimensions
This section provides a brief review of poverty concepts, and then outlines recent development
on multidimensionality and vulnerability which have contributed to the emergence of social
protection.

Review of poverty concepts
Poverty describes a state in which individuals or households show significant deficits in wellbeing.15 Different perspectives on well-being and development emphasize different spaces in
which poverty can be observed and measured. “Resourcist” perspectives define poverty as “the
inability of an individual or family to command sufficient resources to satisfy basic needs”
(Fields 2001:73). These perspectives dominate discussions of poverty and its measurement in
developing countries. Social participation and inclusion perspectives define poverty as
exclusion from cooperative activity; those in poverty are not “able to participate in the social life
of a community at a minimally acceptable level” (Kanbur 1987:64).16 This perspective dominates
discussions of poverty in developed countries. There is no doubt that these two perspectives
can be easily linked. We could define a level of resources required for social inclusion and
participation, satisfying both resources and participatory requirements. Access to resources is
dependent on forms of participation and inclusion. Sen has demonstrated the limitations of
resourcist approaches to poverty by underlining the distance existing between resources and
well-being (Sen 1985, 1999). He argues that the appropriate space to assess well-being, and
therefore poverty as significant deficits of well-being, is that of capabilities and functioning
broadly understood as the capacity to achieve rational life plans. This paper often falls back on
the resourcist approach for simplicity, but it is crucial to keep in mind the need to broaden this
approach further.
There is much debate on the causes of poverty, at different levels of enquiry.17 Micro-studies
focus on identifying the factors leading individuals and households to fall into poverty, and to
stay there. Macro-studies focus on aggregate factors which generate poverty within societies,
such as the type of economic growth, macroeconomic and fiscal policy, and inequality
(especially discrimination and exclusion). Globalization highlights the role of external factors in
generating poverty within a country. These could operate through microeconomic or
macroeconomic linkages (for example, and respectively, through migration and remittances or
through changes in product demand and trade). There is much less debate on the consequences
of poverty, but considerable evidence to support the view that poverty causes harm, and that
extreme or persistence poverty intensifies the harm and could lead to preventable deaths. There
are also important consequences of poverty on society and the economy. Poverty can have
associated costs in terms of social cohesion, morbidity and premature mortality. Poverty
reduction can help realize potential gains from the incorporation of those in poverty more fully
into productive activity.
The review of poverty and vulnerability trends in the previous section already introduced the
poverty headcount rate as one of the most often-used measures of the incidence of poverty in a
population. The poverty headcount rate denotes the share of a population who are in poverty. It
is usually based on estimates of the number of households and individuals whose income or
consumption are below the poverty line, a socially defined minimum standard. This estimate of
the number of households and individuals is then standardized as a proportion of the total
population (annex 1 provides a more detailed description and discussion of poverty measures).
It is also important to know how poor those in poverty are. Adding up the shortfalls
experienced by those in poverty—the gap between their observed income or consumption and
the poverty line—yields the aggregate poverty gap. Distributing this gap across the population,
and dividing by the poverty line, provides a measure of the average depth of poverty. The
poverty headcount rate and the poverty gap rate are the most often used aggregate poverty
measures, capturing respectively the incidence and depth of poverty in a population (annex 2
discusses sources of poverty data for comparative research).

15 Poverty is a state rather than a condition: people are not poor, they are in poverty.
16 The distinction between the “resourcist” and the “social participation” perspectives on poverty has a bearing on the related distinction

between “absolute” and “relative” poverty approaches dominating poverty discussions in developing and developed countries
respectively.

There are two areas of poverty research that have been prioritized by poverty researchers: the
multidimensionality of poverty and its dynamics.18 Developments in these two areas have been
fundamental to the emergence of social protection as a policy framework. Increasingly, social
protection interventions are based on a multidimensional perspective on poverty, which is
reflected in the widening scope of social assistance programmes with an emphasis on
combining and integrating interventions. One particular dimension of poverty is its duration
and persistence. Again, new forms of social assistance pay special attention to this issue and
aim to break the persistence of poverty across generations and to prevent vulnerable household
falling into poverty. Vulnerability provides a more dynamic perspective on poverty. These two
areas will be briefly examined below.

Multidimensionality
There is a broad consensus among poverty researchers around the view that poverty is
multidimensional.19 Households in poverty show consumption deficits often linked to restricted
access to basic services, limited networks and access to economic opportunity. Typically
households in poverty show deficits along many dimensions of well-being at the same time.
There are several difficulties involved in operationalizing this perspective, and so far no agreed
methodological approach to the identification and measurement of multidimensional poverty
has emerged. Identification is a problem. There is no agreement on the main dimensions of
well-being and poverty that analysis should focus on. It is disputed, by Sen (1993) and others,
that a definitive listing of dimensions is feasible or desirable. It is easier to identify a set of basic
dimensions for the purposes of poverty analysis (income, employment, nutrition, health,
education, shelter and information, for example) around which consensus could be easily
reached, but it is more difficult to arrive at consensual measures for security, inclusion and
negative freedoms (Thorbecke 2005). Setting poverty lines for each of these dimensions is a
complex task. Assuming identification issues could be resolved and basic thresholds agreed, a
central conceptual issue is how these different dimensions relate to each other, especially
whether deficits in one dimension could be compensated for with sufficiency in others or
whether they compound deficits in other dimensions.

Vulnerability
A key dimension of poverty is duration, but its analysis has lagged in developing countries,
despite its importance in the context of establishing patterns and causes of mobility into and out
of poverty (Hulme and Shepherd 2003). One of the reasons for this has been the scarcity of
longitudinal datasets in developing countries. Baulch and Hoddinott (2000) reviewed the
conceptual and empirical knowledge on poverty duration in developing countries, and the
Chronic Poverty Research Centre has worked to stimulate research on this important issue
(CPRC 2005). The headline finding from this body of work is that around 40 per cent of those in
poverty in the developing world are in persistent or chronic poverty, confirming that poverty
duration is a significant issue.
More recently, the focus of this work has moved on to the notion of vulnerability as a
prospective approach to poverty duration.20 Vulnerability can be defined as the probability that
18 See Thorbecke’s view that “[m]ost of the remaining issues in poverty analysis are related directly or indirectly to the multidimensional

nature and dynamics of poverty” (Thorbecke 2005:2). See also the review in Jenkins and Micklewright (2007). Multilateral
organizations such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank have championed a multidimensional
perspective on poverty (UNDP 2000; World Bank 2001b).
19 See, for example, the description of poverty in the 1995 Copenhagen Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social

Development. “Poverty has various manifestations, including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable
livelihoods; hunger and malnutrition; ill health; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services; increased morbidity and
mortality from illness; homelessness and inadequate housing; unsafe environments; and social discrimination and exclusion. It is also
characterized by a lack of participation in decision-making and in civil, social and cultural life”(United Nations 1995:para. 19).
20 Research on poverty duration in developing countries can shed light on the characteristics of those in persistent poverty compared to

those in transient poverty (Jalan and Ravallion 2001); and on the factors associated with chronic poverty (Moore 2001; Suryahadi and
Sumarto 2001; McKay and Lawson 2003; Carter and Barrett 2005).

individuals, households or communities will be in poverty in the future.21 As with
multidimensionality, there are significant difficulties involved in identifying and measuring
vulnerability. The core difficulty is establishing, on the basis of present and/or past
information, the likelihood that people will be in poverty in the future. This is intrinsically a
predictive exercise, with all the methodological problems involved.22 However, the gains from
this approach could be large. The significance of vulnerability has been apparent to researchers
working on poverty traps.23 Vulnerability is not only a dimension of poverty, but can also be a
cause of poverty and its persistence. The view that “poverty begets poverty” has been a
commonplace in analysis on the subject.
Vulnerability sheds light on how this applies in developing countries. The likelihood of future
poverty may force some households currently in poverty to adopt protection strategies that are
dysfunctional in the sense that they could end up reinforcing poverty, and could even trap the
households into long-term poverty. The list of micro-strategies that fit into this category is a
long one in developing countries and includes: reducing the number and quality of meals
(Schubert 2005); postponing health-related expenditure (Cutler et al. 2000); withdrawing
children from school and/or engaging in child labour (Emerson and Portela Souza 2003;
Guarceli et al. 2003); engaging in informal employment (Lund and Srinivas 2000); adopting less
productive, but safer, crops (Morduch 1995; Dercon 2005a, 2005b); and resorting to adverse
incorporation as a means of protection, for example, by trading autonomy and the potential for
economic improvement in exchange for security from elites or patrons (Wood 2001).
Vulnerability can itself contribute to chronic poverty. Rational but detrimental responses to
vulnerability are difficult to identify and measure empirically, but an emerging body of
research is making this link with growing confidence. More importantly, the findings from this
research suggest that theses feedback effects may be quantitatively dominant in explaining the
impact of vulnerability on persistent poverty (Elbersg et al. 2003).
Table 1 shows the incidence of household responses to financial crisis among Zambian
households in the bottom and top quintiles. It is worth keeping in mind that the official poverty
headcount rate in Zambia estimated with the same household survey data was 76 per cent, with
a further 10 per cent of the population just above the poverty line. Household responses are
separated into broad categories: dysfunctional strategies include those with adverse long-term
implications for well-being; other strategies are distinguished by the type of social protection
instrument used to ameliorate the impact of the financial crisis, assets, entitlements and
networks. The figures in the table reflect the proportion of households that mentioned a specific
response.
As can be seen from the table, the incidence of dysfunctional strategies is high for all
households but significantly higher among the poorest households. The use of buffers
associated with work is more common among the poorest households than among the richest,
but the reverse is true for public entitlements. Family and community networks appear to be an
important source of protection for both the richest and poorest households, but especially so for
the latter.

21

Those currently in poverty have a significantly higher probability of being poor in the future. Groups in chronic or persistent poverty
are highly vulnerable. “Poverty traps” describe acute vulnerability.

This section has outlined and explained recent developments in poverty analysis on
multidimensionality and vulnerability which have influenced the development of social
protection.

3. Approaches to Social Protection: Rights, Risk, Needs
This section outlines key approaches to social protection, attempting to ground these in existing
perspectives on development. It also makes brief reference to the ethical grounding of social
protection. For the purposes of this paper, the objectives of this section are to emphasize that
these issues are important and to indicate where they could be productively discussed. A full
coverage of the conceptual and ethical basis of social protection is beyond the scope of the
paper.

Perspectives on social protection
Beyond its role as a policy framework addressing poverty and vulnerability, social protection
embodies and extends alternative approaches to economic and social development. This can be
illustrated by considering the different perspectives on social protection proposed by
multilateral organizations.
• The ILO understands social protection as arising from rights. It is defined by
“entitlement to benefits that society provides to individuals and households—
through public and collective measures—to protect against low or declining living
standards arising out of a number of basic risks and needs” (Bertranou et al. 2006).
The international community acknowledged that social protection is a basic
human right to be enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights agreed
by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. In the words of the Declaration,

8

S OCIAL P ROTECTION AND P OVERTY
A RMANDO B ARRIE NTOS

“everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of himself and of his family”. The ILO’s recent reformulation of its mission
statement as involving work to “secure decent work for women and men
everywhere” is an affirmation of their rights perspective and reflects the
Declaration’s commitment to extend social protection to all.24
• The Social Protection Strategy Paper from the World Bank, moves beyond
“traditional” social protection in defining a “social risk management” framework,
adding macroeconomic stability and financial market development to typical
social protection programmes. Social risk management consists of public
interventions “to assist individuals, households and communities in better
managing income risks” (Holzmann and Jorgensen 1999:4). The emphasis on risk
assumes that vulnerability to hazards is a significant constraint on economic and
human development, and that efforts to reduce the likelihood of hazards, or to
ameliorate their effects on living standards, are essential to growth and
development.
• The United Nations defines social protection as “a set of public and private
policies and programmes undertaken by societies in response to various
contingencies to offset the absence or substantial reduction of income from work;
to provide assistance to families with children as well as provide people with
basic health care and housing” (United Nations 2000:4). It is underpinned by
shared “fundamental values concerning acceptable levels and security of access to
income, livelihood, employment, health and education services, nutrition and
shelter” (United Nations 2000:4). This approach extends the role of social
protection to securing basic needs as a precondition for human and economic
development.

The different definitions of social protection adopted by these organizations in fact reflect the
different perspectives on development in which they are grounded. Munro (2008) explores the
basis of social protection in needs, rights and risk approaches to human security.

Conceptual and ethical bases for social protection
To date, discussion on social protection has been dominated by concerns over the effectiveness
of alternative instruments and their design. However, an emerging body of literature is
beginning to investigate the conceptual frameworks which underpin social protection.25 It is
important to explore the conceptual underpinnings of the different policy frameworks
proposed by agencies or individuals as these determine what practical actions are (or are not)
emphasized in the framework.
This literature looks into the linkages between social protection and social theory, and between
social protection and ethics. Social protection as a policy framework is unlikely to be effective if
it is insufficiently grounded in knowledge about the factors and processes that produce and
reproduce poverty and vulnerability, and the factors and processes that facilitate or hinder
social transformation. It is therefore important to link policy back to theory. This is a two-way
process as social protection practice and experimentation can make an important contribution
to the body of knowledge.
There is also increasing awareness and discussion of the linkages existing between social
protection and ethics. Sometimes, these concern design issues such as the selection of
beneficiaries or the setting of programme conditionalities. At other times, these are more
abstract, and discussions about social protection reflect, to an important extent, the shared or
competing views held about what is a fair society (Pogge 1989). Potentially, there are large gains
Social Security: A New Consensus, it is noted that one “of the essential features of the decent work approach is that everybody is
entitled to basic social protection” (ILO 2001:39). This is taken to be an extension of article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, via article 9 of the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, stating “the right of everyone to social
security, including social insurance” (ILO 2001:56).

from connecting social protection to social theory and ethics as this can help us appreciate that
social protection is not only about poverty and vulnerability reduction but also about
developing stable and productive societies with a capacity to adapt to the changes induced by
globalization, climate change and other external factors.26

4. Trends and Key Issues in Social Protection in Developing Countries
The section will begin by identifying regional pathways in the development of social protection
and assistance, in order to contextualize the discussion on programmes design, financing, and
expenditure, which follows.

Why focus on social assistance?
This section will focus on social assistance. It is the component of social protection with the
strongest focus on poverty reduction, the topic of this paper; and it is also where change,
innovation and expansion have concentrated in the last 15 years.
It is important to note from the outset some key differences in the function, scope, and scale of
social assistance programmes in developing countries, compared to developed countries. In
developed countries, social assistance is largely a residual safety net charged with protecting a
small minority of individuals and households from the effects of poverty, after all the other
components of social protection (social insurance, basic services, labour market regulation) have
proved unsuccessful (Gough et al. 1997). In developing countries, where social insurance covers
at best a minority of the labour force, basic services are highly stratified, labour market
regulations are thin and poorly enforced, and the incidence of poverty and vulnerability are
high, social assistance is the primary—and sometimes the only—social protection instrument
addressing poverty and vulnerability.27 The primary role of social assistance in developing
countries calls for fresh approaches and models. As noted above, in developing countries, social
assistance is called to play a broader role than in developed countries, as a key component of
development policy. As in developed countries, social assistance aims to ensure minimum
levels of consumption which protect poor households from the worst effects of deprivation. In
addition, social assistance in developing countries is expected to strengthen productive
capacity, whether through investment in human or physical assets. It is also expected to bridge
access to basic services and therefore weaken social exclusion, advancing the participation of
the poorest in their communities and societies. By comparison with its essentially residual and
compensatory role in developed countries, social assistance in developing countries has a very
different role. In developing countries, social assistance has a primary role within social
protection and is developmental in scope.
Trends in social insurance in developing countries have been mainly negative over the last two
decades, showing a decline in those areas of the developing world where it had previously been
significant (Latin America and transition countries, especially China); and stagnation in
countries where it had reached only a very small share of workers (South Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa). The only significant recent extension of social insurance worth noting is the 30 baht
basic health insurance in Thailand. A key factor explaining the stagnation or decline of social
insurance coverage in developing countries is labour market liberalization, in many cases
associated with globalization. This is also the main factor restricting the spread and
strengthening of labour market regulation. In this context, preparatory studies and discussion
of the Unorganised Sector Workers Social Security Scheme (USWSS) Bill in India is a potentially
significant development. The USWSS Bill aims to incorporate the majority of urban workers,
who work informally, into a basic social insurance scheme.28
26 Both the conceptual and ethical bases of social protection come up again below in the context of programme design issues.
27 In some African countries, a key challenge is to ensure social assistance reaches a majority of the population in poverty.
28 In India, 90 per cent of the urban labour force is outside formal employment.

By contrast, there has been a very a rapid extension of social assistance programmes in
developing countries over the last 15 years. This has come in many forms: the introduction and
extension of pure income transfers, such as non-contributory pensions or child based transfers;
income transfers conditional on work, for example, public works or employment guarantee
schemes; income transfers combined with services, such as conditional cash transfers or
integrated social assistance schemes, and more recently, the development of integrated poverty
reduction programmes.29 There has been a large measure of innovation in the design of social
assistance programmes in developing countries. 30
Scale is also important. In a very short time, social assistance programmes have been introduced
and expanded. The Minimum Living Standards Scheme in China, for example expanded from
2.4 million beneficiaries in 1999 to over 22 million in 2002, as the economic restructuring led to a
rapid increase in unemployment among workers in state-owned enterprises. The Child Support
Grant in South Africa was introduced in 2001 and rapidly scaled up to over 7 million
beneficiaries in 2005. The Bolsa Escola, a programme providing income transfers to poor
families with children of school age, in Brazil was extended on a national basis in 2001, and the
Bolsa Familia, which integrates Bolsa Escola and other transfers to poor households, now
reaches 12 million households. The Employment Guarantee Scheme in India is expected to
reach 24 million households when fully operational. As the transfers support entire households,
the number of those in poverty reached by these transfers is considerably larger. In South Africa
it is estimated that one in four households is supported with income transfers (one in five in
rural Mexico). The rapid extension in the reach of social assistance programmes in developing
countries explains the focus of this section.31

Regional pathways in social protection and assistance
Latin America’s recent experience with innovative poverty and vulnerability reduction
programmes—for example, Bolsa Escola/Familia, Progresa/Oportunidades, and Chile
Solidario—has mobilized international interest in social protection policies. The acute economic
crisis in the early 1980s, followed by structural adjustment and economic liberalization, marked
a dramatic policy shift from the import substitution industrialization developmental model
which had dominated in the region from the 1950s to export-led growth (Edwards 1995). The
immediate outcomes of the crisis and adjustment were rising vulnerability, poverty, and
inequality.32 Reform of social insurance institutions that protected workers in formal
employment was seen as essential to controlling fiscal deficits, but in the context of labour
market liberalization it helped fuel the growth of informality. Workers in informal employment
and their dependants, a majority in the region, remained excluded from formal social protection
institutions. Liberalization also weakened the capacity of public agencies to address rising
poverty, opening the way for fragmented, often externally financed, safety net and social fund
programmes run by parallel agencies. By the mid-1990s, it was clear that more comprehensive
and permanent public responses were needed. The move away from military and emergency
governments ensured democratic governments engaged with the strong demand for social
protection.33
The origins of Bolsa Escola are to be found in the innovative approach to multidimensional and
persistent poverty adopted by the Municipality of Campinas in Brazil, in the mid 1990s, later
extended to the rest of the country (Pochmann 2006). Similarly, Mexico’s Progresa reflected both
29 These are reviewed in more detail below.
30 There is also more room for innovating in social assistance compared to social insurance. The basic design of social insurance models

can be adapted to the conditions present in developing countries, but it is unlikely to depart in significant ways from social insurance
institutions in place elsewhere. The situation is very different when considering social assistance.
31 It is important to keep in mind that while social assistance has made huge advances in reaching those in poverty, the fact that social

assistance budgets are relatively small, compared to social insurance budgets, for example (see table 4), limits their impact on poverty
reduction.

systematic learning from the politicized and ineffective anti-poverty programmes which
preceded its introduction in 1997, and the need to address the human development deficits that
ensured the intergenerational persistence of poverty in rural communities. The new human
development programmes aimed to meet short-term needs, improved consumption and
nutrition, and longer-term aspirations, improved schooling and health and a more productive
population (Morley and Coady 2003).
While international development agencies have played a role in financing, providing technical
assistance, and supporting policy transfers of such programmes, the Latin American dynamic
for social protection is strongly national and regional. The capacity of Latin American countries
to finance social protection is high, although recent extensions of social assistance have relied on
external financing to an important extent, and the capacity to design and monitor experimental
programmes was in place.
South Asia shows considerable diversity in the extension of social assistance programmes. For
historical reasons, social protection consists of a handful of poorly funded and weakly
implemented, overlapping programmes. As regards social assistance, the focus in the region
was initially on colonial programmes of food for work and public assistance for destitutes,
especially the elderly. More recently the extension of social assistance has combined, on the one
hand, efforts by national governments to consolidate social assistance programmes (the
National Social Assistance Programme in India, or the Food Support Programme in Pakistan,
for example), and the introduction of old age non-contributory pension schemes (Bangladesh,
India and Nepal); and on the other, the introduction of poverty reduction programmes focused
on microfinance and asset transfers supported by international aid organizations and NGOs. In
the late 1990s and early 2000s there was much donor-financed activity, ranging from the World
Bank’s Janasaviya Trust Fund to BRAC’s Targeting the Ultra Poor programme in Bangladesh.
Since 2004, India has taken a regional leadership through its National Rural Employment
Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) (Kannan 2006). The NREGS is a social assistance programme, with
the objective of ensuring basic income security for vulnerable households in rural areas with
economic capacity. It extends, on a national scale, the approach to social protection tested in the
Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme. Potentially this scheme could substantially
reduce the insecurity of India’s vast rural population. In practice the early reports on the
NREGS suggest that in relatively well-governed states, such as Kerala (Jacob and Varghese
2006), the policy is being effectively implemented while in poorly governed states, such as
Bihar, it has stalled (Louis 2006).
The support of international aid agencies varies geographically. Donors have substantial
influence in smaller and more aid-dependent countries (Nepal), less traction in larger countries
experiencing economic growth (Bangladesh) and minimal influence in India. In Bangladesh in
particular, donor support has greatly strengthened microfinance and related programmes,
which have replaced emergency food support programmes introduced after the 1975 famine.
Lesson learned from microfinance and asset-building programmes have led to the design and
implementation of integrated anti-poverty programmes, such as BRAC’s Targeting the Ultra
Poor programme.
Southeast and East Asia show a common reliance on family-based social protection, but with
different policy pathways reflecting different responses to rapid social transformation. Among
the more economically advanced countries in Northeast Asia, such as Malaysia, the Republic of
Korea, Singapore, Taiwan Province of China and Thailand, social insurance is the core of social
protection institutions. Interestingly, the 1997 financial crisis served to strengthen the countries’
social insurance pathway (Cook and Kwon 2006). In the Republic of Korea, for example, it led to
the Minimum Living Standards Guarantee Scheme, and in Thailand it led to the introduction of
a universal health insurance scheme. By contrast, among lower-income countries in Southeast
Asia, the Philippines and Indonesia in particular, the routes to extending social insurance were
severely undermined by the 1997 crisis. The immediate response to the financial crisis was the

12

S OCIAL P ROTECTION AND P OVERTY
A RMANDO B ARRIE NTOS

expansion of temporary safety nets, which in countries such as Indonesia have become
permanent forms of social assistance (Sumarto et al. 2008). Transition countries in the region
had a different starting point and evolution, especially China and Viet Nam, and the recent
changes in social protection are primarily directed to addressing rapid economic transformation
and liberalization. In urban China, economic liberalization has led to a rapid decline in the
strength and coverage of social insurance based around productive units, and an equally rapid
rise in social assistance through the Minimum Living Standards Scheme (Chen and Barrientos
2006). In rural China, the main social protection innovation has been the introduction of mixed
provision health insurance schemes, but there are rising concerns about the increasing
vulnerability of rural dwellers. In very low-income countries in the region, such as Laos and
Cambodia, social protection is incipient and restricted to fragmented programmes usually
externally funded (Cook and Kwon 2006).
Sub-Saharan Africa has a legacy of deeply embedded, informal systems of social protection,
especially in rural areas. This is overlaid by underfunded, fragmented and partially
implemented social insurance institutions for civil servants; and by a patchwork of social
assistance programmes focused on emergency support and mostly externally funded.34
Emergency food aid, famine relief and humanitarian assistance have been central to social
protection and social assistance for many African countries since the 1970s. More recently, a
concern to shift from an emergency aid focus into more permanent social protection
programmes has led to the spread of pilot cash transfers schemes, financed by international
institutions. Such initiatives are underway in Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Uganda and
Zambia (Barrientos and Holmes 2007). These countries are piloting cash transfer programmes
targeted on the poorest and most vulnerable, and the majority of schemes include human
development objectives. The Protective Safety Nets Programme in Ethiopia provides an
example of a food security programme incorporating cash-based public assistance components.
The wealthier countries of the Southern Cone, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, are the
exception, with a stronger social assistance focus relying on grants for vulnerable groups,
especially the elderly and children. More recently, social pensions have been introduced in
Swaziland and Lesotho, perhaps signalling the emergence of a distinct approach to social
assistance in the subregion. Social pensions in South Africa and Namibia reflect the successful
adaptation of colonial forms of social protection, once focused on providing a minimum income
floor for whites and coloureds, but later extended to the population as a whole, and providing
vital income redistribution to poorer black households against the background of the end of
apartheid.35 The impact of HIV/AIDS on household structures, the rise in the incidence of
households with “the missing middle”, suggest yet a further adaptation of the social pension to
address a new problem. The introduction of the Child Support Grant in South Africa constitutes
an extension of social assistance with human development objectives (Barrientos and DeJong
2006). While the evolution of social protection in South Africa is closely related to its political
history, the country’s experience shows the way in which a deeply embedded programme—the
social pension—has been adapted over time to address changing vulnerability, including most
recently, the rise in the incidence of households with the missing middle as a result of AIDS or
migration.
This outline of trends in social protection in developing regions suggests the extension of social
protection and social assistance will follow a range of pathways in different regions, depending
on the nature of their existing institutions (determining path dependence), level of economic
development (determining their fiscal space), and features of their economic transformation
(especially the interactions between longer-term transformations such as ageing and short-term
fractures such as transition or change in the development model).

34 The Public Welfare Assistance Scheme in Zambia is a good example (Schubert 2008).

Social assistance: Programme design and objectives
This subsection focuses on discussing social assistance programmes, their characteristics and
key design issues.
In the extension of social protection and social assistance in developing countries in the last
decade and a half, income transfers dominate, but they are increasingly combined with other
interventions targeting human development. The focus below is on regular and reliable social
assistance programmes,36 excluding one-off, or short-term, humanitarian or emergency
assistance.37 It will be useful to classify social assistance programmes into: 38
• pure income transfer programmes which include transfers targeted to poor
households, and categorical transfers such as children and family allowances, and
social pensions (categorical transfers target specific groups thought to be
especially vulnerable);
• income transfer programmes conditional on the supply of labour which require that
beneficiaries supply labour for specific periods of time, and are tied to the
improvement of infrastructure or community services;
• income transfer programmes conditional on human capital investment which include
human development–targeted transfers schemes, also referred to as conditional
cash transfers. These focus largely on education, health and nutrition, and aim to
break the persistence of poverty across generations;
• integrated poverty reduction programmes which constitute an important new
innovation in social assistance, combining a range of interventions focused on the
poorest.

Table 2 provides summary information on these types of programmes in developing countries.
Key design features and impact are then discussed.
Much discussion within social protection in developing countries has focused on the
advantages and disadvantages of specific instruments. Most social assistance programmes
include an income transfer as a primary or secondary instrument. Income transfers have a
number of advantages relative to alternative design options. They can be implemented and
scaled up relatively quickly, have an immediate impact on consumption, and are capable of
reaching the very poorest. Having noted this, it is highly unlikely that a single social protection
instrument could achieve the manifold objectives of protecting household consumption,
promoting asset accumulation, strengthening productive capacity and inclusion, and reducing
poverty, vulnerability and inequality. It is therefore vitally important that discussions around
design options shift from the current focus on single instruments to a broader focus on
integrated programmes or a mix of programmes, capable of progressing the different objectives
of social protection among the poor and poorest. The experience in Latin America with
programmes combining transfers and services shows that they can be effective both in
improving consumption and facilitating human development objectives. It also demonstrates
that the programmes’ effectiveness increased where complementary interventions are included,
such as skills, employment, saving and participation. Moving progressively toward integrated
social protection programmes for the poor and poorest is the main challenge for the future.
Integrated poverty reduction or eradication programmes place much greater demand on
36 Emergency and humanitarian transfers are examined by Paul Harvey (2005).
37 The list below does not include in-kind transfers which support households in poverty with food or other necessities (food-based

transfers are important in parts of Africa and South Asia), or input grants for small-scale farmers, involving tools or seeds for example,
that are in place in some countries in Africa (Malawi) and South Asia (Bangladesh). These are mostly one-off or irregular transfers.
38 There is an important distinction to make in social assistance interventions based on their timeframe. We could identify permanent

programmes (perhaps policies could be a better term) such as the Child Support Grant in South Africa; fixed-term programmes with
the potential for extension such as Mexico’s Oportunidades which has a five-year finance window; and short-term programmes (or
projects) which have limited potential for extension (some pilots fit into this category, for example Zambia’s Kalomo District Social
Transfer Scheme which was funded by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ/German Society for Technical
Cooperation) for a four-year period). This will be covered below.

The extent to which social protection interventions should select beneficiaries based on their
poverty status has attracted some attention in the literature. A great deal of discussion on this is
pitched around the effectiveness of selection, with those arguing against selection emphasizing
the costs associated with selecting beneficiaries, in terms of administration and stigma. On the
other hand, the high incidence of poverty in developing countries makes the selection of
beneficiaries a necessity where resources for poverty reduction are insufficient to reach
everyone. Selection is also discussed in the context of the dynamics of poverty reduction in a
political economy context. In Latin America in particular, the selection of beneficiaries through
a process of ranking households according to the extent of their poverty has constituted a
response to widely held concerns that anti-poverty programmes in the past proved ineffective
because of political clientelism and corruption. The selection of beneficiaries through agreed
and transparent methods can build credibility and political support for social protection

interventions. Combining attention to the costs of selection, to the influence of programme
design on the dynamics of social protection expansion, and to strengthening solidarity and
supporting shared values of social justice, are crucial challenges for social protection in
developing countries.

Financing and capacity constraints
There are concerns over the financing of an extension of social protection in developing
countries. These concerns are stronger in the case of low-income countries (Smith and Subbarao
2003). The concern is less about affordability than about long-term sustainability. Affordability
is less of an issue when the costs of not having social protection are factored in. The current
gaps in effective social protection have significant costs to society in terms of poverty and
vulnerability (ILO 2005). These gaps place restrictions on the development of human capital
which themselves become a constraint on growth and development (Bourguignon 2004). The
costs to individuals and households associated with their vulnerability can be high. In this
context, it is helpful to see the extension of social protection not as “new” expenditure, but as a
shift in the financing mix. Extending social protection involves moving away from an exclusive
reliance of households’ out-of-pocket expenditures and informal provision to a more diversified
mix (Barrientos 2008a). This is clear in the context of the introduction of health insurance
institutions. In their absence, out-of-pocket household expenditure on health care is often
inefficient as well as insufficient because, first, responses to health shocks can crowd out
investment in preventive care and second, they are rationed by available resources. Health
insurance instruments can improve the efficiency of households’ health expenditures and make
resources go further. The costs of social assistance programmes focused on the poor and poorest
are small in absolute terms. Income transfers in Latin America are below 1 per cent of gross
domestic product (GDP) (this is considered in greater detail in the next subsection).
Affordability is not an insurmountable problem in establishing or extending social assistance in
developing countries.
This is not so say that financing the extension of social assistance will be easy. The constraints to
financing social protection and assistance in poorer countries are significant (Smith and
Subbarao 2003; Barrientos 2007b, forthcoming). In low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa,
poor revenue mobilization is an important barrier to the extension of social assistance. In
countries where 15 per cent of GDP, or less, is mobilized for public spending, the fiscal space for
an extension of social assistance is very limited, even if programmes for the poorest are kept
below 1 per cent of GDP. International aid can ease the costs associated with the initial
introduction or scaling up of social assistance programmes, but longer-term sustainability
remains an issue. In the medium and longer run, domestic financing is essential. The route to
the expansion of social protection followed by today’s developed countries was through payroll
taxes to finance social insurance, but this is an unlikely route for countries in which the majority
of the labour force works informally. Finding new sources of revenue mobilization, while
strengthening existing sources, poses a significant challenge to the future of social protection.
New aid modalities such as general budget support could extend the time frame for external
support for social protection in low-income countries.
Capacity limitations are a further barrier to the extension of social protection in developing
countries. These apply at several points in the policy cycle, beginning with the capacity to
study, measure and analyse poverty and vulnerability, the capacity to design and implement
appropriate policies, and the capacity to deliver and evaluate social protection programmes. On
the ground, a successful extension of social protection will involve the vertical integration of
poverty researchers, policy analysts, political scientists, financial experts, programme managers,
information systems analysts and developers, accountants and field officers. Developing these
capacities in low-income countries has not been an explicit objective of policy makers, research
institutes or international organizations. In many low-income countries, government
restrictions on recruitment and salaries, as well as “departmentalism”, make it unlikely that
government agencies could develop these networks and ensure their integration. Engaging

16

international NGOs to fill in this gap provides a short-term palliative, but not a longer-term
solution. This is an area in which technical fixes may be feasible—for example, through donor
support for the development of the appropriate skills—and there is also the potentially
significant role of intergovernmental transfers of information, knowledge, and know how
across the developed and developing world, and within the latter.

Social protection expenditure and poverty
National governments have a central role in the extension of social protection and assistance.
Analysis of their resource allocation to social protection and assistance would in principle
provide a window into existing priorities and achievements in these areas. However, the
measurement and analysis of government social protection expenditures is in practice beset by
difficulties and gaps in data. There is no consensus on the scope of public social protection and,
until recently, no agreed guidelines for measuring government social protection expenditures
(See annex 3 for a note on government social protection expenditure data). This explains the
absence of accurate and reliable data on government social protection expenditures. Research in
this area has developed ways of extracting information from very limited data.
In the context of examining social protection and poverty, three key questions emerge:
1. Is government social protection expenditure associated with improved poverty
indicators?
2. What is the appropriate level of government social protection expenditure among
developing countries? Are developing countries spending too little on social
protection?
3. What types of government social protection expenditures have greater impact on
poverty reduction?

Before reviewing existing work in this area, there are two important preliminary points which
need to be made.
First, it is crucial to keep in mind that government social protection expenditure is a subset of
all social protection expenditures. These include corporate and not-for-profit social protection
expenditures and, importantly, private or household social protection expenditures. In
developing countries, off-budget international aid expenditures on social protection can be
significant. As a consequence, increases in government social protection expenditures might not
add up to an increase in total social protection expenditure, for example, where rising public
expenditure crowds out private expenditure on social protection. However, this rebalancing of
the social expenditure mix can be welfare enhancing, as in the case of health insurance schemes
replacing out-of-pocket payments by households.
Second, the link between government social protection expenditure and poverty reduction is
also likely to be mediated by other factors in important ways, for example by the pattern and
size of vulnerability in a country, the incidence of both vulnerability and government social
protection expenditure, and the effectiveness of social protection schemes. Basically a simple
model of government social protection expenditure (SPEx) influencing poverty (P) as P =
f(SPEx), hides the influence of other factors, such as vulnerability (V), policy environment
influencing effectiveness (PE), incidence of social protection expenditure (I), and resource
mobilization capacity (R), as in P = f(SPEx, V, PE, I, R).
Besley et al. (2003) focus on comparing long-term government social protection expenditures
across countries and regions, with the objective of benchmarking government expenditure on
safety nets. They ask the following question: what is government expenditure on social
protection for particular countries compared to countries in similar circumstances? They use
two measures of social protection expenditure: government expenditure on social security and
welfare as a proportion of GDP, and transfers to organizations and households also as a

17

S OCIAL P OLICY

AND

D EVELOPMENT

proportion of GDP. The data are taken from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Government Finance Statistics, averaged over five years and then through the period 1972–
1997. They rank countries along these two measures. Then they undertake two adjustments, one
taking account of structural factors affecting the economies of the countries (GDP, population,
shocks, regions); and another taking account of institutional capacity and quality. Countries are
re-ranked after each adjustment. The approach has the advantage that it incorporates structural
and capacity factors in assessing the social protection effort by a country. Their approach
suggests that focusing solely on expenditure data provides a very limited understanding of this
effort.
Baulch et al. (2005) developed a social protection index for six countries in Asia to be used as a
policy instrument by the Asian Development Bank’s work on social protection. A key
innovation in this work is the attempt to connect overall social protection expenditure to
poverty reduction. The index combines measures of expenditure, coverage, poverty targeting,
and impact on the poverty gap. A comparison of the index with the Human Development Index
(HDI) rankings for the six countries shows a high correlation, as the authors conclude, this “is
not unexpected as, by and large as GDP per capita (one of the HDI components) increases, the
amount of spent on social protection will increase” (Baulch et al. 2005:15).
Analysis of the poverty reduction impact of the components of government social protection
expenditure is severely constrained by the lack of reliable data. Comparative research on this
issue is stronger for Latin America, both due to better data and a growing interest in the
poverty reduction potential of social insurance and social assistance. Castañeda’s is one of a
number of studies examining the impact of the crises and structural adjustment in Latin
America in the 1980s and 1990s, which motivated concerns with the resilience or otherwise of
different components of social expenditure (Castañeda 2002). He finds that social expenditures
stagnated in the 1970s and 1980s, but grew in the 1990s, with social security expenditures
growing faster than health or education. The impact on poverty of this increase in social
security expenditure was limited by the fact that social insurance expenditure is skewed toward
the middle- and high-income groups. Lindert et al. developed a detailed analysis of the
components of social protection expenditures for a range of countries in Latin America (Lindert
et al. 2005). They found that government social insurance expenditure (net of contributions) is
highly regressive. In their estimation, “those in the top quintile of the population receive about
60% of net social insurance transfers” (Lindert et al. 2005:43). Some social assistance expenditure
is regressive too, but the bulk of expenditure reaches those in poverty. The fact that overall
spending on social assistance programmes is low limits the impact of this expenditure on
poverty. Some governments in the region, Mexico and Brazil in particular, are committed to a
very gradual re-balancing of expenditure, away from social insurance and toward social
assistance.
What can be inferred about the relationship between government social protection expenditure
and poverty from the available data? We could check whether long-term higher levels of social
protection expenditure are consistent with lower current poverty by regressing the estimates of
social protection expenditure from Besley et al. (2003) and current poverty estimates. This is an
empirical test of the simple model above. Table 3 summarizes the results. Not surprisingly,
there is a strong correlation existing between long-term levels of social protection expenditure
and current poverty, but the computed adjusted R2s suggest that long-term social protection
expenditure measures account for only a fraction of the variation in current poverty (the
remainder is perhaps explained, inter alia, by the other factors influencing poverty policy
mentioned above). The results indicate correlation, not causation. Replacing social expenditure
measures with total government expenditure as a proportion of GDP produce similar results, at
least for the poverty headcount rate, suggesting that social protection expenditure might be
simply a proxy for total government expenditure (that is, it could be possible that it is the size of
government rather than social protection expenditure which is captured by the correlation
between expenditure and poverty headcount rates).

heteroscedasticity.

Figure 3 below looks at the relationship between long-term social protection expenditure (social
security and welfare/SSW) and current poverty headcount rates, by region. This is helpful in
revealing the make-up of the sample used in the regressions above. It also demonstrates that the
negative relation between the two variables can be observed at the regional level.
Table 4 shows the main components of social protection expenditure, social insurance and
social assistance for selected countries in Latin America and Asia. The large variation across
countries in the share of GDP devoted to social protection suggests that the level of expenditure
is to an important extent a policy variable, rather than simply the outcome of deterministic
factors (such as the level of development, economic structure, and so on). Social protection
expenditures are therefore mediated by policy processes to a very significant extent. The
balance of expenditure between social insurance and social assistance is noteworthy. Social
assistance expenditure is a fraction of social insurance, even in the case of Latin American
countries where the latter was measured net of contributions (that is, as the fiscal support for
social insurance schemes). Finally, the range of public expenditure on social assistance is
considerably narrower than the same range for social protection. Among Latin American
countries the range is from 0.5 to 1.5 per cent of GDP, whereas in Asia it is lower at 0.1 to 1.1per
cent of GDP.
To recap, there are significant gaps and considerable difficulties involved in measuring social
protection in developing countries, with available data being limited and patchy. Higher levels
of long-term government social protection expenditures are correlated with lower poverty
indicators, whether the poverty headcount or the poverty gap were used. It is likely that the
level of public expenditure on social protection is one among a number of factors influencing
poverty. There is considerable variation in public expenditure on social protection as a
proportion of GDP, suggesting that there is no unique level of public expenditure on social
protection to target. The distribution of expenditure among the different components of social
protection is perhaps of greater significance in the context of poverty reduction. For a small
sample of countries with available data, it appears that social insurance accounts for the largest
share of expenditure. Social assistance, the component of social protection with the strongest
focus on current poverty reduction, accounts for a small fraction of expenditure, ranging
between 0.1 and 1.7 per cent of GDP.

Conclusion
This concluding section brings together some of the main points of the paper and speculates on
the linkages between social protection and broader approaches to poverty reduction and
development.

Extending social protection in low-income countries
This report aimed to provide an overview of social protection, as well as an assessment of its
potential contribution to addressing poverty and vulnerability in developing countries.
In developing countries, social protection has emerged as a policy framework addressing
poverty and vulnerability, in the context of economic and financial crises in the 1980s and 1990s,
structural adjustment, and globalization. Rising poverty and vulnerability following the 1980s
‘lost decade’ in Latin America, the financial crises in 1997 in Asia, and rapid economic
transformation in transition economies, demonstrated the need to establish strong and stable
institutions directly concerned with reducing and preventing poverty and vulnerability. Social
protection provides a policy map, linking an understanding of poverty and vulnerability as
multidimensional and persistent to policy interventions. There are different versions of this
policy map, with some emphasizing risk, rights or needs—but these share much common
ground. An important feature of this common ground is the broader developmental role of
social protection in developing countries and its focus on (extreme) poverty reduction.
The extension of social protection in developing countries has focused on social assistance, as
opposed to social insurance or labour market regulation.39 In the last 15 years, there has been a
great deal of innovation in social assistance programmes, and a step increase in their reach.
Regular and reliable social assistance programmes based around income transfers, but
increasingly combining access to basic services and investment in human development, now
reach a significant proportion of those in poverty in the South. Where impact evaluation results
are available, they show that new forms of social assistance have reduced poverty and raised
human development. However, only a fraction of social assistance programmes are able to
produce robust evidence on impact.
The extension of social protection in developing countries faces several constraints which will
need to be overcome. These constraints are more acute for low-income countries. Among these
constraints, finance is a key barrier to the extension of social protection. The issue is long-term
sustainability, as developing countries are not in a position to finance the extension of social
protection through payroll taxes, central to the emergence of the welfare state in developed
countries. Alternative sources of resource mobilization will be needed. Capacity constraints are
a problem in low-income countries, but this is a more tractable issue than finance. Successfully
combining poverty reduction, insurance, and redistribution objectives will also require
continued innovation in programme design. Transforming time-limited interventions into wellsupported and resourced institutions will also be a challenge. The future of social protection in
developing countries is bright and promising, but not yet secure.

Social protection and welfare regimes
The report identified distinct pathways in the extension of social protection and assistance at the
regional and subregional levels. As the discussion there suggested, these pathways are very
likely to evolve in line with the nature of their existing institutions (determining path
dependence), level of economic development (determining their fiscal space), and the defining
features of their economic transformation (determining the relative autonomy of social policy).
A key question to consider is whether following one pathway, as opposed to another, has
implications for poverty. This is a hard question to answer, empirically at least. The new forms
39 The financial and economic crisis that has affected global markets since 2008 may create new opportunities—but also constraints—on

the extension of social protection in developing countries. However, a discussion about these issues goes beyond the scope of this
paper which was commissioned and finalized before the current global crisis came to prominence.

of social assistance discussed in the paper have emerged only in the last decade and a half, and
some of the programmes discussed are still in the process of implementation. Their fit with
wider institutional structures and with other economic and social policies has not been
investigated, and perhaps it is premature to do so at this stage.
The welfare regime literature has attempted this type of comparative analysis for developed
countries. Esping-Andersen (1990, 1999) has identified enduring configurations in welfare
production among developed countries, through examining the mix of institutions addressing
social risks: state, family and markets for short. He finds that liberal countries, mainly AngloSaxon ones, rely on markets as the main institutions for addressing social risks; while
conservative countries, mainly European countries with strong Catholic parties, rely on the
family; and Scandinavian countries rely on the state. These are enduring regimes that are selfreinforcing through the stratification effects they generate. Path dependence is strong. His
outcome indicator is, however, not poverty but de-commodification and de-familialism,
respectively the extent to which individuals’ welfare status is independent of what they can sell
in the market, and independent of their position within the family. The Scandinavian welfare
regime tops the scores on both these outcome indicators.
An emerging literature is attempting to adapt the welfare regimes approach to developing
countries (Gough and Wood 2004). Welfare production in some regions and subregions
suggests the presence of similar configurations, welfare production shown by a number of
countries in East Asian and Latin America appear to cluster into distinct regimes.40 Yet, these
are hard to pin down because, compared to the strong path dependence shown by welfare
regimes in developed countries, welfare production in these clusters has undergone more or
less structural shifts. The emergence of social assistance programmes in Latin America
discussed above is an important feature of the shift in welfare production in that region.
Configurations in welfare production in developing countries do not appear to have the
permanence and resilience shown by developed countries’ welfare regimes (Barrientos 2004).
Mapping and analysing welfare institutions in developing countries is therefore a work in
progress, although analysis of outcomes is feasible. Gough has attempted to cluster developing
countries on the basis of welfare indicators (Gough 2004). His findings suggest this is a
promising area of research.
Determining the implications of different social protection pathways for poverty and
vulnerability reduction remains an urgent question for researchers to tackle. The likely impact
on poverty and vulnerability of the extension of social protection underway in developing
countries is not in doubt. For a given level of economic development, countries that put more
investment in human development will show lower levels of poverty and deprivation (Ahmad
et al. 1991). Investment in social protection and social assistance can be extremely effective in
reducing current poverty and vulnerability, as well as poverty persistence across time and
generations. Countries with stronger social protection and assistance institutions show lower
rates of poverty and vulnerability, and are more resilient in the face of economic and social
transformation.

Annex 1: Poverty Measures
It will be useful to review briefly key poverty concepts that will be used extensively in what
follows. A poverty function can be defined as p(yi , z), where the extent of poverty p is taken to
be dependent on a well-being indicator “y” (say, income) for individual “i” and a poverty line
“z”. The poverty function reads as “the extent of poverty faced by individual i associated with a
well being indicator y when the poverty line is z”. The poverty line z is the minimum socially
acceptable level for this particular well being indicator. Setting a food poverty line for the
average individual in a specific community can involve defining a minimum level of nutrition,
selecting a basket of foodstuff consumed locally capable of delivering that basic level of
nutrition, and estimating the value of this basket at local prices. The same process can be
followed for basic non-food items, education, health care, and so on.
Several individual poverty functions are commonly used in the literature:
• a poverty incidence indicator is: p1(yi , z) = 1
• a poverty gap measure is:

p2(yi , z) = z - yi

if yi < z , 0 otherwise;
if yi < z , 0 otherwise;

The poverty incidence indicator gives a number 1 if an individual/household is in poverty and
zero if not. The poverty gap measure yields the individual/household shortfall with respect to
the poverty line. The individual poverty functions can be aggregated for a population N as
follows:
• aggregate poverty incidence indicator is: P1 = ΣNi=1 p1(yi , z) = 1 if yi < z , 0
otherwise;
• aggregate poverty gap measure is: P2 = ΣNi=1 p2(yi , z) = z - yi if yi < z , 0 otherwise;

To facilitate comparison across time and across countries aggregate poverty measures are
usually standardized as follows:
• Headcount poverty rate is: PH = 1/N ΣNi=1 p1(yi , z) = 1 if yi < z , 0 otherwise;
• Average poverty gap is:

PG = 1/N ΣNi=1 p2(yi , z) = z - yi if yi < z , 0 otherwise;

The headcount poverty rate measures the fraction of the population who are in poverty, while
the average poverty gap takes the poverty gap and averages it across the population. Foster et
al. (1984) have provided an elegant formulation of this class of poverty measures into the
following poverty function Pα :
α

1 q  (z − yi 
Pα ( y, z) = ∑

N i=1  z 

, forα ≥ 0

where α can be interpreted as a measure of aversion to poverty, q is number of
individuals/households in poverty. Note that if α=0, the Pα function measures the headcount
poverty rate (by definition x0 = 1, so that for α=0, P0 = q/N). Also note that if α=1, the Pα
function measures the poverty gap normalized as a fraction of the poverty line. For α>1, the
weight attached to those in greater poverty rises, α=2 for example gives the square of the
poverty gap.

Annex 2: Sources of Poverty Data for Comparative Research
Comparative research on poverty has generally focused on poverty incidence as the primary
measure. The first Millennium Development Goal (MDG), on poverty reduction, has as a first
target to reduce “by half the proportion of people living of less than 1 US$ a day” by 2015.
There are important technical and data issues in measuring global poverty in this way which
have been examined in detail in the relevant literature.41 Country data on “cosmopolitan”
poverty (using two poverty lines, $1 and $2, defining thresholds for extreme and moderate
poverty respectively) is available from World Development Indicators in two series: poverty
incidence and poverty gap.
The focus of this report on social protection and poverty suggests that “non-cosmopolitan”
poverty data is likely to be more appropriate in this context.42 Poverty measures estimated from
household survey data, using appropriate adjustments for household composition, and national
poverty lines are more likely to capture the linkages between poverty and policy, of which
social protection is a component. National poverty lines are more likely to capture poverty
understood as deficits from a socially agreed minimum living standard. It is also the latter
which influences policy debates, say on social protection. The World Development Indicators
provides consistent poverty incidence measures, based on household data and using national
poverty lines, but no series on poverty gap measures is available.
Poverty measures estimated on a consistent basis across countries in a particular region, or
subregion, would be particularly useful in tracking clusters of countries with similar policy
environments, as in the welfare regime literature, for example. The Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) provides consistent estimates of poverty for selected
countries in the region, published in its Social Panorama of Latin America. Estimates for both
poverty incidence and gap are available, as well as separate estimates for rural and urban
populations. In several papers published by the United Nations Development Programme’s
(UNDP) International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth (IPC), Kakwani and collaborators
estimate consistent poverty lines for several countries in sub-Saharan Africa and model
alternative social protection options (Kakwani and Subbarao 2005; Kakwani et al. 2005). It
should be possible to use these regionally consistent poverty estimates, which have the
advantage of providing estimates for poverty incidence and poverty gap measures. To my
knowledge there are no comparable data series for Asia and transition countries.
Country-level poverty estimates are available, but show large variation in quality, and often
have idiosyncratic methodologies which would need to be documented in some detail before
making cross-country comparisons.
Aside from the UNDP’s Human Development Index, there are no consistent sources of data on
multidimensional poverty. There are no consistent sources of data on vulnerability.

41 Deaton 2000; Chen and Ravallion 2004; Reddy and Pogge 2005.
42 The point, as I see it, is to compare poverty across countries, where countries are taken as a policy-making unit, as opposed to

comparing individuals or households in poverty in different countries.

Annex 3: A Note on Government Social Protection Expenditure Data
Until very recently, statistics on public expenditure on social protection were not explicitly
collected by international organizations. The emergence of social protection as an important
component of development policy has encouraged efforts to systemize data counterparts.43 The
ILO, European Union (EU) and the IMF have considered ways to measure government social
protection expenditure.44 At the same time, the need to assess the size and effectiveness of social
protection–related multilateral and bilateral aid has made it necessary for them to attempt to
distinguish social protection aid flows (Milazzo and Grosh 2007).45 At this point in time, it
would be fair to say this is a work in progress.
It would be useful to describe the approach which is taken to measuring government social
protection expenditure.
• Starting with a definition, social protection schemes are defined by the IMF
Government Finance Statistics Manual (IMF 2001:18) as: “systematic interventions
intended to relieve households and individuals of the burden of a defined set of
risks”.
• The Manual identifies three types of such schemes: social assistance schemes,
social security schemes, and employer social insurance schemes.
• Classifications of social protection schemes by risk or function are also available.
Hagemejer reports a classification according to social risks covered: sickness,
health, disability, survivors, employment injury, old age, family and children,
unemployment and labour market policies, labour market programmes, housing,
social assistance, basic education, food and nutrition (Hagemejer n.d.). Within
these categories, distinguishing social protection functions is in practice a
complicated task. For example, not all education expenditures have a social
protection function (as described in the definition above), but education subsidies
for low-income households conditional on school attendance do. Child-based
education subsidies can be assumed to be a social protection intervention in
primary education, but perhaps this is less clear cut in the context of secondary
education and tertiary education. Distinguishing government expenditures on
health related social protection is a much harder task.
• Measurement of the size of expenditures focuses on aggregate measures of cash or
in kind transfers to beneficiary households.

In sum, current efforts in systematizing the collection of government social protection
expenditure data will produce improvements in the future, but at present the available data are
limited in coverage and highly imperfect. Reliable expenditure data on social protection is
available for European and countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD),46 but it is highly uneven for developing countries. ECLAC’s Panorama
Social provides a time series on Social Security and Assistance Expenditure (ECLAC 2007). To
my knowledge, none of the other regional Banks provide comparable statistics.
The most comprehensive source of government social protection expenditure will remain the
IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Series. Besley et al (2003) compile a long-term average
(1970–1997) of two variables from this series:
• Social Security and Welfare Expenditure: which includes transfer payments
(including in kind) to compensate for the reduction or loss of income or

44 IMF 2001; European Union 2002; Hagemejer n.d.
45 The UK Department for International Development (DFID) is developing a set of guidelines for measuring social protection aid within

the context of the UK Government reporting duty to Parliament.
46 The Social Expenditure Database, SOCX 2007, provides data for 1980–2003 (OECD 2007).

inadequate earnings capacity; sickness, maternity, and temporary disablement
benefits; government employees pension schemes; old age, disability, or
survivor’s benefits; unemployment compensation benefits; family and child
allowances; and other social assistance to persons and to residential institutions
for children or the elderly.
• Transfers to organizations and households: which includes current transfer payments
to private institutions such as hospitals and schools, learned societies,
associations, and sports clubs that are not operated as enterprises; current
payments in cash (not in kind) to households, adding to their disposable income
without any simultaneous, equivalent counterpart provided in exchange by the
beneficiary, and neither generating nor extinguishing a financial claim; usually
intended to cover charges incurred by households because of the appearance, or
existence, of certain needs and risks.

These are perhaps the best data available to explore social protection expenditure over time for
comparative purposes. These two variables are used in the analysis in the text above to explore
the link between poverty and government social protection expenditure.

United Nations Research Institute for Social Development
UNRISD is an autonomous agency engaging in multidisciplinary research on the social dimensions of contemporary
problems affecting development. Its work is guided by the conviction that, for effective development policies to be
formulated, an understanding of the social and political context is crucial. The Institute attempts to provide
governments, development agencies, grassroots organizations and scholars with a better understanding of how
development policies and processes of economic, social and environmental change affect different social groups.
Working through an extensive network of national research centres, UNRISD aims to promote original research and
strengthen research capacity in developing countries.
Current research programmes include: Civil Society and Social Movements; Democracy, Governance and Well-Being;
Gender and Development; Identities, Conflict and Cohesion; Markets, Business and Regulation; and Social Policy and
Development.
