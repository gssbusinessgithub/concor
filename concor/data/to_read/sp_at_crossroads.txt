Since the last edition of the World Social Protection Report, in 2017, the world has been rocked
by a crisis unlike anything in living memory. While we will not know the full implications of the
COVID-19 pandemic for some time, one thing is already clear – the value of social protection
has been unequivocally confirmed.
The pandemic response generated the largest mobilization of social protection measures ever
seen, to protect not just people’s health but the jobs and incomes on which human well-being
equally depends. As we seek now to create a human-centred recovery, it is imperative that
countries deploy their social protection systems as a core element of their rebuilding strategies.
There are glimmers of optimism amid the devastation wrought by the pandemic, and this
renewed appreciation of the importance of social protection is one. The crisis not only
underscored its indispensability, but radically reconfigured policymakers’ mindsets. They can
no longer ignore the precarious situation of the many front-line workers whose essential role
became clear during the crisis, or of the informal workers who have frequently been excluded
from social protection schemes.
Another hard reminder provided by the crisis has been that we are only as safe as the most
vulnerable among us; our well-being and destinies are intimately entwined, regardless of our
location, background or work. If some people cannot count on income security while sick or in
quarantine, then public health will be undermined and our collective well-being jeopardized.
This renewed appreciation of social protection was well reflected in the adoption of the
conclusions on social protection by the governments, employers and workers of the ILO’s
187 Member States at the International Labour Conference in June 2021. This served as a
powerful reminder that rights-based social protection systems, anchored in the principle of
solidarity, are at the core of decent work and social justice.
As we start to look beyond the crisis to recovery, it is essential that we do not forget the
painful lessons it has taught us. We must not allow complacency to creep in. Now is the
moment to strengthen and invest in social protection systems everywhere, including social
protection floors, so we are better prepared for whatever future crises may come. This means
implementing a rights-based approach, with universal social protection systems that guarantee
access to adequate, comprehensive support throughout people’s lives, regardless of the type
of employment they have or the nature of their work. This is essential for the human-centred,
equitable recovery we need.
This World Social Protection Report provides a global overview of recent developments in social
protection systems and examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on new and
robust data, it offers a broad range of global, regional and country statistics on social protection
coverage, the benefits provided, and related public expenditure.
The report also identifies the protection gaps that must be closed, and sets out key policy
recommendations for achieving the goal of universal social protection for all by 2030. This
will require concerted collaboration between governments and workers’ and employers’
organizations, UN agencies and other stakeholders.
Many countries stand at a crossroads, debating the future of their social protection systems.
I urge them to look forward with hope, heed the call of this report, and use the window opened
by COVID-19 to pursue the high road to universal social protection. It is an ethical and rational
choice, and one that paves the way to social justice for all.

X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

Despite progress in recent years in extending
social protection in many parts of the world, when
the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic
hit many countries were still facing significant
challenges in making the human right to social
security a reality for all. This report provides a
global overview of progress made around the
world over the past decade in extending social
protection and building rights-based social
protection systems, including floors, and covers
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing
so, it provides an essential contribution to the
monitoring framework of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development.
Five messages emerge from the report:
The pandemic has exposed deep - seated
inequalities and significant gaps in social
protection coverage, comprehensiveness
and adequacy across all countries. Pervasive
challenges such as high levels of economic
insecurity, persistent poverty, rising inequality,
extensive informality and a fragile social contract
have been exacerbated by COVID-19. The crisis
also exposed the vulnerability of billions of
people who seemed to be getting by relatively
well but were not adequately protected from the
socio-economic shock waves it has emitted. The
pandemic’s socio-economic impacts have made
it difficult for policymakers to ignore a number
of population groups – including children, older
persons, unpaid carers, and women and men
working in diverse forms of employment and
in the informal economy – who were covered
either inadequately or not at all by existing social
protection measures. In revealing these gaps, this
report shows that the pandemic has propelled
countries into unprecedented policy action, with
social protection at the forefront.
COVID-19 provoked an unparalleled social
protection policy response. Governments
marshalled social protection as a front-line
response to protect people’s health, jobs and
incomes, and to ensure social stability. Where
necessary, governments extended coverage to
hitherto unprotected groups, increased benefit
levels or introduced new benefits, adapted
administrative and deliver y mechanisms,
and mobilized additional financial resources.
However, despite some international support,
many low- and middle-income countries have
struggled to mount a proportionate social
protection and stimulus response to contain the
pandemic’s adverse impacts in the way that highincome countries have been able to do, leading to

a “stimulus gap” arising largely from significant
coverage and financing gaps.
Socio-economic recovery remains uncertain and
enhanced social protection spending will continue
to be crucial. The most recent IMF forecasts warn
of a divergent recovery, whereby richer countries
enjoy a swift economic rebound while lowerincome nations see a reversal of their recent
development gains. Ensuring a human-centred
recovery everywhere is contingent on equitable
access to vaccines. This is not only a moral
imperative, but also a public health necessity: a
deep chasm in vaccine availability will unleash
new viral mutations that undermine the public
health benefits of vaccines everywhere. Already,
however, inequitable vaccine access, yawning
stimulus gaps visible in the crisis response,
unfulfilled calls for global solidarity, increasing
poverty and inequalities, and recourse to austerity
cuts all indicate the prospect of uneven recovery.
Such a scenario will leave many people to fend for
themselves and derail the progress made towards
the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and the
realization of social justice.
Countries are at a crossroads with regard to the
trajectory of their social protection systems. If
there is a silver lining to this crisis, it is the potent
reminder it has provided of the critical importance
of investing in social protection; yet many countries
also face significant fiscal constraints. This report
shows that nearly all countries, irrespective of
their level of development, have a choice: whether
to pursue a “high-road” strategy of investing in
reinforcing their social protection systems or
a “low-road” strategy of minimalist provision,
succumbing to fiscal or political pressures.
Countries can use the policy window prised open
by the pandemic and build on their crisis-response
measures to strengthen their social protection
systems and progressively close protection gaps
in order to ensure that everyone is protected
against both systemic shocks and ordinary lifecycle risks. This would involve increased efforts
to build universal, comprehensive, adequate and
sustainable social protection systems, including
a solid social protection floor that guarantees at
least a basic level of social security for all over
the course of their lives. The alternative would
be to acquiesce in a low-road approach that fails
to invest in social protection, thereby trapping
countries in a “low cost–low human development”
trajectory. This would represent a lost possibility
for strengthening social protection systems and
reconfiguring societies for a better future.

Executive summary

Establishing universal social protection and
realizing the human right to social security for all
is the cornerstone of a human-centred approach
to obtaining social justice. Doing so contributes

X

The state of social protection:
Progress made, but not enough

As of 2020, only 46.9 per cent of the global
population were effectively covered by at least
one social protection benefit 1 (Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) indicator 1.3.1; see
figure ES.1), while the remaining 53.1 per cent – as
many as 4.1 billion people – were left wholly
unprotected. Behind this global average, there are
significant inequalities across and within regions,
with coverage rates in Europe and Central Asia
(83.9 per cent) and the Americas (64.3 per cent)
above the global average, while Asia and the
Pacific (44.1 per cent), the Arab States (40.0 per
cent) and Africa (17.4 per cent) have far more
marked coverage gaps.
Only 30.6 per cent of the working-age population
are legally covered by comprehensive social
security systems that include a full range of
benefits, from child and family benefits to old-age
pensions, with women’s coverage lagging behind
men’s by a substantial 8 percentage points. This
implies that the large majority of the working-age
population – 69.4 per cent, or 4 billion people – are
only partially protected or not protected at all.
Access to healthcare, sickness and unemployment
benefits has taken on particular relevance during
the pandemic. While almost two thirds of the
global population are protected by a health
scheme of some kind, significant coverage and
adequacy gaps remain. When it comes to income
protection during sickness and unemployment,
the coverage and adequacy gaps are even more
pronounced. Approximately a third of working-age
people have their income security protected by
law in case of sickness, and less than a fifth of
unemployed workers worldwide actually receive
unemployment benefits.
Gaps in the coverage, comprehensiveness
and adequacy of social protection systems are
associated with significant underinvestment in
social protection, particularly in Africa, the Arab
States and Asia. Countries spend on average
12.9 per cent of their gross domestic product (GDP)
1

to preventing poverty and containing inequality,
enhancing human capabilities and productivity,
fostering dignity, solidarity and fairness, and
reinvigorating the social contract.

Excluding healthcare and sickness benefits.

on social protection (excluding health), but this
figure masks staggering variations. High-income
countries spend on average 16.4 per cent, or
twice as much as upper-middle-income countries
(which spend 8 per cent), six times as much as
lower-middle-income countries (2.5 per cent),
and 15 times as much as low-income countries
(1.1 per cent).
This financing gap for building social protection
floors has widened by approximately 30 per cent
since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, owing to the
increased need for healthcare services, income
security measures, and reductions in GDP caused
by the crisis. To guarantee at least a basic level of
social security through a nationally defined social
protection floor, lower-middle-income countries
would need to invest an additional US$362.9 billion
and upper-middle-income countries a further
US$750.8 billion per year, equivalent to 5.1 and
3.1 per cent of GDP respectively for the two
groups. Low-income countries would need to
invest an additional US$77.9 billion, equivalent
to 15.9 per cent of their GDP.
COVID-19 threatens to imperil years of progress
towards achieving the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs), reversing gains in poverty reduction.
It has also revealed the pre-existing stark
protection gaps across all countries and made
it impossible for policymakers to ignore the
persistent social protection deficits experienced
in particular by certain groups, such as informal
workers, migrants and unpaid carers.
This crisis has resulted in an unprecedented
yet uneven global social protection response.
Higher-income countries were better placed to
mobilize their existing systems or introduce new
emergency measures to contain the impact of
the crisis on health, jobs and incomes. Mounting
a response was more challenging in lower-income
contexts, which were woefully ill prepared and
had less room for policy manoeuvre, especially in
macroeconomic policy.

Executive summary

X

Social protection for children remains limited,
yet is critical for unlocking their potential

Highlights
X The vast majority of children still have no

effective social protection coverage, and only
26.4 per cent of children globally receive social
protection benefits. Effective coverage is
particularly low in some regions: 18 per cent in
Asia and the Pacific, 15.4 per cent in the Arab
States and 12.6 per cent in Africa.

X Positive recent developments include the

adoption of universal or quasi-universal child
benefits (UCBs/qUCBs) in several countries,
and renewed awareness in the context of
COVID-19 of the critical importance of inclusive
social protection systems, quality childcare
services and the need for social protection for
caregivers.

X

X On average, national expenditure on social

protection for children is too low, equating to
only 1.1 per cent of GDP, compared to 7 per cent
of GDP spent on pensions. The regions of the
world with the largest share of children in the
population, and the greatest need for social
protection, have some of the lowest coverage
and expenditure rates, especially sub-Saharan
Africa (0.4 per cent of GDP).

X To address the dramatic increase in child

poverty caused by COVID-19, close social
protection coverage gaps and deliver the best
results for children and society, policymakers
must implement an integrated systems
approach including child benefits and childcare
services, provision of parental leave and access
to healthcare.

Social protection for women and men
of working age provides insufficient protection
against key risks

Highlights
X Maternity: Some countries have made decisive

progress towards universal or near-universal
effective maternity coverage. Despite the
positive developmental impacts of supporting
childbearing women, only 44.9 per cent of
women with newborns worldwide receive a
cash maternity benefit.

X Sickness: The crisis has demonstrated the

importance of ensuring income security during
ill health, including quarantine. However, only
a third of the world’s working-age population
have their income security protected by law in
the event of sickness.

X Disability: The share of people with severe

disabilities worldwide who receive a disability
benef it remains low at 33.5 per cent.
Importantly, several countries now have
universal disability benefit programmes in
place.

X Employment injury: Only 35.4 per cent of the

global labour force have effective access to
employment injury protection. Many countries
have recognized COVID-19 as an occupational
injury in order to ensure easier and faster
access to associated benefits under the work
injury insurance system, in particular for
workers in the most exposed sectors.

X Unemployment protection: A mere 18.6 per

cent of unemployed workers worldwide have
effective coverage for unemployment and
thus actually receive unemployment benefits.
This remains the least developed branch of
social protection. However, the pandemic has
highlighted the crucial role of unemployment
protection schemes to protect jobs and
incomes, through job retention schemes and
unemployment benefits.

X Expenditure estimates show that worldwide

only 3.6 per cent of GDP is spent on public
social protection to ensure income security for
people of working age.

X

Social protection for older women and men
still faces coverage and adequacy challenges

Highlights
X Pensions for older women and men are the

most widespread form of social protection in
the world, and a key element in achieving SDG
target 1.3. Globally, 77.5 per cent of people
above retirement age receive some form of
old-age pension. However, major disparities
remain across regions, between rural and
urban areas, and between women and men.
Expenditure on pensions and other benefits for
older people accounts for 7.0 per cent of GDP
on average, again with large variations across
regions.

X Significant progress has been made with

respect to extending the coverage of pension
systems in developing countries. Even more
encouraging, in a wide range of countries,
including lower-middle-income countries,
universal pensions have been developed as
part of national social protection floors.

X The COVID-19 crisis has brought additional

pressures to bear on the costs and financing
of pension systems, but the impact over
the long term will be moderate to low. The

X

massive response of countries to the crisis
has highlighted the critical role that old-age
protection systems, including long-term care,
play in ensuring the protection of older adults,
particularly in times of crisis, and the urgency
of strengthening long-term care systems to
protect the rights of care recipients and care
workers alike.
X Pension reforms have been dominated by

an emphasis on fiscal sustainability, at the
expense of other principles established by
international social security standards, such as
the universality, adequacy and predictability
of benefits, solidarity and collective financing.
These are critical for guaranteeing the income
security of older people, which is and should
remain the primary objective of any pension
system. Ensuring the adequacy of benefits
is especially pertinent for women, people in
low-paid jobs and those in precarious forms
of employment. Moreover, many countries
around the world are still struggling to extend
and finance their pension systems; these
countries face structural barriers linked to low
levels of economic development, high levels of
informality, low contributory capacity, poverty
and insufficient fiscal space, among others.

Social health protection: An essential contribution
to universal health coverage

Highlights
X Significant progress has been made in

increasing population coverage, with almost
two thirds of the global population protected
by a scheme. However, barriers to accessing
healthcare remain in the form of out-ofpocket payments on health services, physical
distance, limitations in the range, quality and
acceptability of health services, and long
waiting times, as well as opportunity costs
such as lost working time. The COVID-19 crisis
has highlighted the limitations of benefit
adequacy and the need to reduce out-of-pocket
payments.

X Collective financing, broad risk-pooling and

rights-based entitlements are key conditions
for supporting effective access to healthcare
for all in a shock-responsive manner. The
principles provided by international social
security standards are more relevant than ever
on the road to universal health coverage, and
in particular within the current public health
context. More and better data on legal coverage
need to be collected as a matter of priority to
monitor progress on coverage and equity.

X Investing in the availability of quality healthcare

services is crucial. The COVID-19 pandemic has
further revealed the need to invest in healthcare
services and to improve coordination within
the health system. The pandemic is drawing
attention to the challenges faced in recruiting,

Executive summary

deploying, retaining and protecting welltrained, supported and motivated health
workers to ensure the delivery of quality
healthcare services.
X Stronger linkages and better coordination

between mechanisms for accessing medical
care and income security are needed to address
key determinants of health more effectively.
The COVID-19 crisis has further highlighted the
role of the social protection system in shaping

X

behaviours to foster prevention and the
complementarity of healthcare and sickness
benefit schemes. Coordinated approaches are
particularly needed in respect of special and
emerging needs, including human mobility, the
increasing burden of long and chronic diseases,
and population ageing. The impact of COVID-19
on older people has shed additional light on
the need for coordination between health and
social care.

Taking the high road towards universal
social protection for a socially just future

COVID-19 has further underscored the critical
importance of achieving universal social protection.
It is essential that countries – governments, social
partners and other stakeholders – now resist the
pressures to fall back on a low-road trajectory and
that they pursue a high-road social protection
strategy to contend with the ongoing pandemic,
and to secure a human-centred recovery and an
inclusive future. To this end, several priorities can
be identified.

with the collective well-being and security of
others – the pandemic has demonstrated the
indispensability of social protection. Moreover,
the crisis has shown that there is significant
scope for countries to adopt a “whatever it takes”
mindset to accomplish priority goals if they so
choose. If the same policy approach is applied
as the worst of the pandemic abates, this holds
promise for taking the high road to achieve the
SDGs and universal social protection.

X COVID-19 social protection measures must be

maintained until the crisis has subsided and
recovery is well under way. This will require
continued investment in social protection
systems to maintain living standards, ensure
equitable vaccine access and healthcare, and
prevent further economic contraction. Ensuring
equitable and timely access to vaccines is
crucial for the health and prosperity of all
countries and peoples. In an interconnected
world, a truly inclusive recovery hinges on this.

X The temptation to revert to fiscal consolidation

Conversely, striving for a jobs-rich, humancentred recovery, aligned with health, social,
environmental and climate change goals, can
contribute to income security, job creation and
social cohesion objectives, expand the tax base
and help finance universal social protection.

1.1 Introduction

Social protection is at a critical crossroads.1 Around
the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed
the vulnerability of those who are not adequately
protected from its socio-economic consequences.
In responding to the crisis, governments have
used social protection policies to protect public
health, jobs and incomes. They have extended
coverage of existing benefits,
improved or introduced new
ones, adapted administrative
and delivery mechanisms, and

exposed the
vulnerability of
those who are
not adequately
protected.

This crisis has underscored the
vital role of social protection
as a front-line policy response.
Crucially, it has made the
c ase for uni ver s al social
protection irrefutable. The
weakness of limited safety-net
approaches, typically characterized by narrow
targeting and tightly monitored conditionalities,
has become glaringly apparent. These types of
programmes fall woefully short of providing the
necessary protection in times of crisis and cannot
provide the broad-based coverage needed to
ensure an equitable recovery. However, while
the unprecedented initial response to COVID-19
provided a massive impetus for universal social
protection, in many countries this response has
been neither sustained nor sufficient. Short-term
measures, lasting only a few months, have come
to an end; and benefit levels have often been too
low to ensure an adequate standard of living.
These measures have thus provided only limited
underpinning for a full recovery, leaving many
people highly vulnerable.
Now, even before a full recovery, fiscal austerity
is already looming large. This is a matter of
concern, bearing in mind especially that economic
activity is unlikely to rebound strongly any time
soon, and that the structural challenges of the
pre-COVID-19 world, with its weakened social
contract (precarious employment, inequality,
and tax evasion and avoidance) have not yet
been adequately addressed. In the context of

1

significantly increased poverty and inequality,
such a scenario could derail what progress has
been made towards the achievement of the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development and the
realization of human rights.
Now is the time to take decisive action to shape
the future of social protection. It remains to be
seen whether the lessons learned from this crisis
and previous ones will provide the necessary
jolt for universal social protection to be realized.
To achieve this would require gaps in coverage,
comprehensiveness and adequacy to be closed,
and national social protection systems to be
reinforced, not least with solid social protection
floors that guarantee at least a basic level of
social security to everyone throughout their lives.
While a limited social safety-net approach may
appear appealing to some under conditions of
austerity and fiscal consolidation, it will not be
sufficient to meet the needs of people, societies
and economies. Unless emergency measures are
systematically transformed into elements of rightsbased social protection systems, large numbers
of people will be unceremoniously consigned to
circumstances no better than, and in many cases
worse than, those in which they found themselves
before COVID-19: left to fend for themselves with
insufficient protection or even none at all.
It has never been more important than it is now
to renew and sustain progress towards meeting
the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda. Universal social
protection is a cornerstone of a human-centred
vision for the future, offering the prospect of
realizing the human right to social security for all,

2030 Agenda.

Social protection, or social security, is defined as the set of policies and programmes designed to reduce and prevent poverty
and vulnerability across the life cycle. Social protection includes nine main areas: child and family benefits, maternity protection,
unemployment support, employment injury benefits, sickness benefits, health protection, old-age benefits, disability benefits
and survivors’ benefits. Social protection systems address all these policy areas by a mix of contributory schemes (mainly social
insurance) and non-contributory tax-financed schemes (universal/categorical schemes and social assistance).

1.2 Social protection at the crossroads:
The challenge

COVID-19 hit the world at a time when many
countries had not yet recovered from the 2008
global financial crisis. After nearly a decade of
austerity, most countries were struggling to
address a range of challenges that have now
been further exacerbated by the pandemic and its
socio-economic repercussions. This combination
of circumstances has further raised the stakes for
social protection.
Despite positive trends in some parts of the
world, many countries still face significant
challenges in closing social protection gaps to
make the human right to social security a reality
for all. Social protection systems operate in a
context of high, and sometimes growing, levels
of informality and inequality, marked by limited
fiscal space, institutional fragmentation and
competing priorities, as well as climate change,
digital transformation and demographic shifts.
Changing work and employment relationships,
alongside weakened labour market institutions,
have contributed to growing levels of inequality
and insecurity, and stagnation in labour incomes,
in many parts of the world. In this context, the
proven capacity of social protection to reduce
and prevent poverty, and to address inequality,
remains as relevant as ever (SDG targets 1.3, 5.4
and 10.42).
While there has been some progress in reducing
extreme poverty, rising levels of inequality have
eroded trust in public institutions and undermined
already fragile social contracts in many parts of the
world (Razavi et al. 2020; Global Commission on the
Future of Work 2019; ILO 2016e). The globalization
of trade and finance, the financialization of the
economy, technological changes and new forms
of work, pervasive informality and poor working
conditions, and the privatization of public services
have deepened cleavages between those who can
benefit from these developments and others who
are being pushed behind them (Elson 2018). The
share of global income earned by workers has
declined in comparison with the share gained by
capital, while disparities in workers’ earnings have
also widened (ILO 2019d, 2020i).

2

In many contexts, less progressive taxation on
income and other resources, and the relative
shifting of the tax burden from capital to labour,
have contributed to stagnation in real wages and
rising levels of inequality and economic insecurity
(ILO 2020i; UNDP 2019; Berg 2015b). Economic
gains have been disproportionately captured by
those at the very top of the income distribution:
not only have the richest 1 per cent of the global
population captured around 27 per cent of income
growth between 1980 and 2016, while the bottom
half of the population received only 12 per cent,
but the total wealth of the world’s billionaires
reached a new peak during the pandemic of
US$10.2 trillion in July 2020 (Alvaredo et al. 2017;
UBS 2020; Oxfam 2020). For many people who
are struggling to find decent work and maintain
an adequate standard of living, promises of
upward social mobility and equal opportunities
have not been fulfilled, thereby eroding trust in
government, or even in democracy itself (Razavi
et al. 2020; OECD 2018).
While there have been some advances in women’s
enjoyment of their rights, gender inequality
persists in families, economies and societies.
Almost everywhere, women still do not enjoy equal
pay with men for work of equal value – a shortfall
partly related to their disproportionate share of
unpaid care work and intransigent patterns of
discrimination – and they make up nearly two
thirds of contributing family workers (those who
work in family businesses without any direct
pay) (ILO 2018a, 2019f; UNDP 2019; UN Women
2020a). These persistent inequalities inhibit
women’s access to social protection, in terms of
both coverage and benefit levels, contributing to
their stubbornly higher risk of falling into poverty,
compared to men. In the COVID-19 crisis, women
have been affected by employment loss more
than men, and more women than men are leaving
the workforce, perhaps as a result of intensified
unpaid workloads (ILO 2020k; UN Women 2020c).
Some of the gains made in gender equality over
recent decades are being reversed.

Target 5.4: “Recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure
and social protection policies, and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally
appropriate”. Target 10.4: “Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve
greater equality”.

1. Social protection at the crossroads: The COVID-19 response and the road to recovery

Many countries are struggling with high structural
unemployment and underemployment and
rising economic inactivity rates, especially
since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis (ILO
2021k). Many countries, too, are saddled with
fragmented labour markets, high levels of
informality and consequently high – and in many
cases growing – levels of economic insecurity,
particularly for workers in temporary or casual
forms of employment, involuntary part-time
employment and self-employment (ILO 2018f,
2020z). Some of the policy reforms undertaken
since the mid-1970s, aimed at deregulation,
privatization, greater labour market flexibility,
and lower labour costs and social spending,
have shifted economic risks to workers, further
increasing their vulnerability. Moreover, in many
sectors, the emergence of new business models
has created incentives for self-employment and
greater recourse to complex subcontracting and
service contracts, often without adequate social
protection provisions (ILO 2016d, 2021q).

1.2.1 Responding to these
pressing challenges through
social protection
The capacity of social protection to contain and
reduce inequality and poverty has been critical
for bolstering social cohesion and renewing social
contracts. For Member States of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), taxes and in particular social transfers
reduce inequality by approximately one quarter
on average, although their equalizing effect varies
widely across countries (OECD 2015, 2018). It is
no coincidence that countries that invested early
in universal social protection policies, such as
the Nordic countries, tend to be characterized
by lower levels of income inequality and higher
levels of social cohesion than others (Palme and
Kangas 2005). Interestingly, the quality of social
protection systems is considered to be one of the
reasons for the relatively high levels of happiness
recorded in the Nordic countries (Martela et al.
2020). Evidence indicates that the combined
redistributive effects of taxes and transfers are
of critical importance in establishing a more
equitable income distribution, and that countries
with higher levels of social expenditure tend to
achieve lower income inequality (Cantillon 2009;
UNDP 2019).

31

Over the past couple of decades, many countries
across Africa, Asia and Latin America have
bolstered their social protection systems,
albeit starting from a much lower level of social
expenditure than most advanced economies.
There is strong evidence that non-contributory
cash transfer programmes in low- and middleincome countries have contributed to poverty
reduction, with overall positive effects on health,
education and labour market outcomes (Bastagli
et al. 2019). For example, South Africa’s taxfinanced social transfers addressed to families
with children, older people and persons with
disabilities, together with other transfers and
taxes, and increased health and education
spending, have reduced income inequality – as
measured by the Gini coefficient – from 0.737
to 0.538 (Goldman, Woolard, and Jellema 2020).
Social protection policies also play an important
role in promoting social cohesion, with positive
effects on relationships of trust and reciprocity,
thereby promoting voice, accountability and
gender equality (Babajanian 2012).

1.2.2 Progress has been
made, but much more
remains to be done
Despite laudable progress in building social
protection systems over more than 100 years, the
majority of the world’s population is still excluded
from any form of social security. Lessons learned
from COVID-19 strengthen the case for countries
to redouble their efforts to build universal,
adequate and comprehensive social protection
systems, including social protection floors.

and social repercussions of the pandemic may

In view of these challenges, social protection
systems need to be vigorously reinforced to
support an inclusive and sustainable recovery, to
promote social justice and to realize the human
right to social security for all (see section 1.3
below), placing progress towards the SDGs back
on track and indeed accelerating it. Investing
in social protection is an essential lever for the
SDGs, contributing to multiple goals,3 in particular
the elimination of poverty (SDG 1) and hunger
(SDG 2), and the promotion of good health and
well-being (SDG 3), gender equality (SDG 5), decent
work and economic growth (SDG 8), reduced
inequalities (SDG 10), and peace, justice and
strong institutions (SDG 16) (figure 1.1). As well as
supporting the economic and social dimensions
of sustainable development, it also contributes
to the environmental pillar, especially SDG 13,
through its role in facilitating the “just transition”
towards greener economies and societies (ILO
2017f, 2019g; UN 2020i, 2020e).

1.3 Moving towards universal social protection
systems, including floors: Leaving no one behind

Social security is not charity, but a fundamental
human right. The challenges that individuals
and societies face today are manifold, including
ever more rapidly changing labour markets
in the context of ecological, technological
and demographic transformations, requiring
constant upskilling. Universal social protection
is both an indispensable safeguard and a lever,
enabling people to live dignified lives and to
embrace change with confidence, and as such
is a precondition for a human-centred future of
work. Crises, whether related to health, economic
shocks, climate change, or disasters and conflicts,
have always underlined the need to expand social
protection as a key tool to combat poverty and
inequalities and strengthen social cohesion. Crises
also demonstrate that societies with solid social
protection systems in place can more effectively
and rapidly protect their populations against the
adverse impacts of such events.
Universal social protection, indeed, lies at the
core of societies’ social contract and sustainable
development. It guarantees that all members

3

Looking back, we can see that investment in
universal social protection and public services has
been a key element in helping countries recover
from major crises, for example in promoting
recovery from the devastation of the Second
World War in Europe and other parts of the world,
and in Asia after the financial crisis of 1997. Now,
having learned the painful lesson of premature
fiscal consolidation after the 2008 economic
crisis, we are at the point where short-term crisis
responses must be transformed into sustained
responses, to build and reinforce social protection
systems, including solid social protection floors.
Only if social protection is not limited to the role
of a fire brigade in times of crisis, but is seen as an
integral part of public policy in less eventful times
too, can it play its role in protecting people against
life’s trials and tribulations, stabilizing economies
and societies, and promoting decent work and
social justice (see Chapter 5).

of society are well protected, be they children
or older persons, or those affected by ill health,
unemployment or disability, on a basis of social
solidarity and collective financing. By ensuring
access to healthcare and income security, it
prevents or at least alleviates poverty and reduces
vulnerability, social exclusion and inequality,
while suppor ting grow th and prosperit y.
During economic recessions, it stimulates
aggregate demand, thereby ser ving as an
economic stabilizer. It can facilitate structural
transformations, for example supporting workers
in changing jobs and occupations. Universal social
protection also contributes to gender equality, by
empowering both women and men to invest in
their capabilities, seize economic opportunities
and nurture their capacity to aspire to different
kinds of lives (Appadurai 2004).
The status of social security as a human right is
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (1948, Arts 22 and 25), the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights (1966, Arts 9 and 11) and other human

Social protection is explicitly or implicitly referred to in at least five SDG targets (1.3, 3.8, 5.4, 8.5 and 10.4).

rights instruments.4 The enjoyment of this right
by all requires that States assume their overall
and primary responsibility for building and
maintaining social protection systems. Realizing
the right to social security also helps realize other
economic, social and cultural rights, including
the right to adequate food, clothing and housing,
and those rights that pertain to education
and health, all of which are essential to the
realization of human dignity (Morlachetti 2016;
Sepúlveda and Nyst 2012). Finally, by investing in
inclusive and sustainable growth, social cohesion,
justice and peace, and being accountable to rightsholders, States can revitalize their strained social
contracts (Global Commission on the Future of
Work 2019; Razavi et al. 2020).5
T h e n o r ma t i v e f r a m e w o r k p r o v i d e d b y
international labour standards takes a rightsbased approach to giving the human right to social
security concrete form (see box 1.1).6 It defines the
minimum levels of protection to be ensured, the
strategy for achieving such levels of protection
and the core principles for building comprehensive
and sustainable social protection systems. In
the holistic vision laid out in international social
security standards by the world’s governments,
employers and workers, universal social protection
encompasses three core outcomes (ILO 2019j):

advocates a two-dimensional

2. comprehensive protection with regard to the
social risks and contingencies that are covered:
this includes protection not only across the
nine life contingencies (see note 1 above and
box 1.1), but also against other risks, such as
the need for long-term care;

Recommendation No. 202 (Para. 3) outlines
19 core principles – including the responsibility of
the State – underpinning the framework within
which social protection systems should be built,
extended, financed, implemented, monitored and
evaluated in line with the human rights principles
of equality and non-discrimination, participation,
transparency and accountability (ILO 2019i;
Behrendt et al. 2017). These principles do not
prescribe a one-size-fits-all model; rather, they
represent an optimal combination of means for
achieving universal social protection in line with
national circumstances, while striking a balance
among universality, adequacy, solidarity and
sustainability. This usually results in a countryspecific mix of social insurance and tax-financed
benefits to provide protection to all across the life
cycle, so as to ensure both solidarity and financial,
fiscal and economic sustainability.

3. adequate protection: preventing or at least
alleviating poverty, vulnerability and social
exclusion, and allowing people to lead
dignified lives.

Importantly, Recommendation No. 202 places
overall and primarily responsibility for the
implementation of the core principles with the
State. The State is charged with progressively

access to social protection throughout the

Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), Arts 26 and 27; and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
(2006), Art. 28. See also UN (2008).

A social contract can be defined as an implicit agreement between all members of a society – whether defined in terms of
government and citizens, labour and capital, or different population groups – to cooperate for their mutual benefit and
respect each other’s rights and obligations (ILO 2016e).

Relevant instruments are compiled in ILO (2019f).

1. Social protection at the crossroads: The COVID-19 response and the road to recovery

X Box 1.1 The ILO’s normative framework for building

social protection systems, including floors

Since its establishment in 1919, and on the basis of a clear constitutional mandate, the ILO has developed a
coherent international framework that guides the establishment, development and maintenance of social
security systems across the world (ILO 2021c). ILO social security standards comprise a comprehensive
set of Conventions and Recommendations elaborated and adopted by representatives of governments,
employers and workers from all ILO Member States. Recognizing that protection outcomes can be
attained by various mechanisms, ILO social security standards focus on the minimum levels of protection
that need to be guaranteed (in terms of persons to be covered, benefit levels, qualifying periods and
duration of benefits; see Annex 3), essential rules guiding the financing and administration of social
security, and core principles that need to be observed irrespective of the chosen mechanism.
International social security standards are often primarily associated with contributory schemes, but in
fact have a much wider scope. They cover a wide range of benefits and schemes that can form part of
social protection systems, including means-tested non-contributory mechanisms, tax-financed public
schemes offering flat benefit rates, statutory minimum benefit schemes and, subject to the fulfilment
of certain conditions, voluntary schemes as well. International social security standards therefore offer
an excellent reference framework for administrations undertaking and assessing reforms.
The Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), and the Social Protection Floors
Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), are the two most prominent instruments in this area.1 Convention
No. 102 is the first and to date the only international treaty that addresses social security, referring to
nine social security contingencies that all human beings may face over their life course: the need for
medical care, and the need for benefits in the event of sickness, unemployment, old age, employment
injury, family responsibilities, maternity, invalidity and survivorship (where a dependant outlives an
earner). While not yet universally ratified, this instrument has established the basis for the development
of social security throughout the world.
Promulgated 60 years later, and taking stock of the remaining gaps in protection and contemporary
challenges, Recommendation No. 202 provides a normative policy vision of how universal social
protection can be achieved in the twenty-first century. This entails, first, the establishment of national
social protection floors for all persons in need of protection as a matter of priority; and, second, ensuring
higher levels of protection for as many persons as possible, and as soon as possible. Introduced into
international law, national social protection floors comprise a set of basic social security guarantees that
ensure effective access to essential healthcare and basic income security at a level that allows people to
live in dignity throughout their lives. These guarantees should include at least:
X access to essential healthcare, including maternity care;
X basic income security for children, ensuring access to nutrition, education, care, and other necessary

goods and services;

particular in cases of sickness, unemployment, maternity and disability;

X basic income security for older persons.

In addition to establishing the core principles that constitute the backbone of rights-based universal
social protection systems, Recommendation No. 202 invites Member States to formulate, through
inclusive social dialogue and broad-based consultation, a strategic approach in the form of national
social protection policies and strategies aimed at closing coverage and adequacy gaps, ensuring policy
coherence by enhancing coordination and avoiding overlaps, and developing synergies with other
economic and social policies. It also contains guidance on monitoring to help countries assess their
progress in improving the performance of national social security systems.

by providing safeguards against
misuse of power in the form of
efficient and accessible complaint and appeal
procedures. Finally, effective social dialogue
and tripartite participation throughout the
design and implementation of national social
protection systems will ensure that policies and
legal frameworks are transparent, consensual
and balanced, and respect the rights and
dignity of everyone without discrimination while

responding to people’s particular needs (ILO
2018e, 2019i). Collectively, these principles act as
the backbone holding up national social protection
systems – failure to obser ve one of them
potentially compromises the present and future
solidity of the entire architecture. The added value
of the ILO’s approach to social protection lies in its
reliance on this unique set of principles agreed by
the world’s governments, employers and workers
to guide the development and implementation of
rights-based national social protection systems in
times of crisis and beyond.
In 2019 and again in 2021, the governments,
employers and workers of the ILO’s 187 Member
States called for universal social protection in a
human-centred approach to shaping a fair, inclusive
and secure future of work and to the recovery from
the COVID-19 pandemic (see box 1.2).

X Box 1.2 A strong mandate for universal social protection
In June 2021, the International Labour Conference adopted two documents that emphasize the important
role of rights-based universal social protection systems in realizing the human right to social security
for everyone.
In their Global Call to Action for a Human-Centred Recovery from the COVID-19 Crisis, governments,
employers and workers of the ILO’s 187 Member States committed themselves to “achieve universal
access to comprehensive, adequate and sustainable social protection, including nationally defined social
protection floors, ensuring that, at a minimum, over the life cycle, all in need have access to basic income
security and to essential healthcare, recognizing the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable
standard of physical and mental health as more important than ever” (para. 11.C.(a)), highlighting in
particular the important role of unemployment protection, adequate paid sick leave and sickness
benefits, health and care services, family leave and other family-friendly policies.
The Conclusions concerning the second recurrent discussion on social protection (social security) call on ILO
Member States to ensure that measures aimed at strengthening rights-based social protection systems
that are adequate, sustainable and inclusive of all workers and enterprises respond to developments in
the world of work and are duly coordinated with employment, labour market and active inclusion policies
to promote decent work and the formalization of employment. This requires in particular improved
coverage of those not yet adequately protected, ensuring access to adequate social protection for
workers in all types of employment and making social protection systems more inclusive and effective
as enablers of national formalization strategies (points 13(c) and (d)).
Already in 2019, the ILO Centenary Declaration for the Future of Work (2019) called on Member States
to develop and enhance social protection systems that are “adequate, sustainable and adapted to
developments in the world of work” (II.A.xv), and to strengthen the capacities of all people to benefit
from the opportunities of a changing world of work through “universal access to comprehensive and
sustainable social protection” (III.A.iii).

1.4 Building the statistical knowledge base
on social protection and monitoring relevant SDGs

This report is based on the ILO World Social
Protection Database (WSPD), the leading global
source of in-depth country-level statistics on
various dimensions of social protection systems,
including key indicators for policymakers, officials
of international organizations and researchers. It
is used for both the UN’s monitoring of the SDGs
(UN 2017b, 2017a) and national monitoring of social
protection indicators. The data and indicators in
this report are also available online in the ILO
World Social Protection Data Dashboards. These
dashboards provide a broad set of social protection
statistics at the national, regional and global levels
through interactive graphs, maps and tables.7
The key indicators, including SDG 1.3.1, 8 are
collected through the ILO Social Security Inquiry
(SSI), an administrative survey submitted to
governments that dates back to the 1940s. In
2020 the ILO launched the SSI online platform,
which improved the data compilation process
for users around the world.9 The data from the
ILO SSI are complemented by data from other
sources, notably the Social Security Country
Profiles compiled by the International Social
Security Association (ISSA) in collaboration with
the United States Social Security Administration
(SSA), which constitute the main source of legal
information about and characteristics of national
social protection programmes.10
From its first edition in 2010, the World Social
Protection Report has been envisioned as a tool
to facilitate the monitoring of the state of social
protection in the world. This report is accordingly
intended as a contribution to joint efforts at
the national and international levels to ensure

the availability of high-quality social security
statistics. The intention is to support ILO Member
States in monitoring and reviewing their social
protection systems, including floors, to ensure the
effectiveness and efficiency of those systems in
meeting the needs of their populations (UN 2017a).
Owing to a refined methodology and better
data availability, the current global and regional
estimates presented here are not necessarily
comparable to earlier figures.
Progress towards building social protection
systems, including floors, and the achievement
of SDG target 1.3, require enhanced monitoring
capacities in order to provide a solid evidence base
for policymakers. Indeed, ILO Recommendation
No. 202 includes a strong commitment by
governments and social partners to monitor
progress in extending social protection, including
through participatory mechanisms and according
to international standards.11 This necessitates
systematic investment in national statistical
capacities in the area of social protection to
make available reliable social
security statistics based on
a shared methodology and
agreed definitions. Additional

(OECD SOCX); the World Bank HDNSP pensions database and Atlas of Social Protection Indicators of Resilience and Equity
(ASPIRE); and the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) Global Health Observatory and national health workforce accounts.
The WSPD also draws on national official reports and other sources, which are usually largely based on administrative data,
and on survey data from a range of sources including national household income and expenditure surveys, labour force
surveys, and demographic and health surveys, to the extent that these include variables on social protection.

1.5 Objective and structure of the report

As the world struggles to recover from the
COVID-19 pandemic, with only nine years to go to
2030, this report takes stock of the current state
of social protection systems, reviews progress
made in recent years, identifies remaining
gaps and challenges, and sketches out possible
pathways for the future. The report monitors
key social protection indicators, such as the
extent of both legal and effective coverage and
the adequacy of benefits, as well as expenditure
and financing indicators, and discusses major
challenges in realizing the right to social security
for all. Continuing the approach taken in previous
editions (ILO 2010, 2014c, 2017f), the importance
of a human rights framework for social protection
systems is emphasized throughout.
The report is structured in a way that acknowledges
the disruption caused by COVID-19. Chapter 2
reviews the situation prior to the pandemic and
highlights a range of pre-existing challenges, many
of which were exacerbated by the crisis. Chapter 3
focuses specifically on the health, economic
and social impacts of COVID-19, and the social
protection responses to it, and sets out possible
pathways for the future. Chapter 4 examines in

turn specific areas of social protection, following
a life-cycle approach that reflects the four social
protection guarantees set out in Paragraph 5 of
Recommendation No. 202.12 Section 4.1 focuses on
social protection for children, in particular on child
and family benefits, and its complementarity with
care services. Section 4.2 addresses schemes and
programmes ensuring income security for people
of working age, including maternity protection,
unemployment protection, employment injury
protection and disability benefits. Section 4.3
focuses on income security in old age, with
a particular emphasis on old-age pensions.13
Section 4.4 addresses the crucial role of universal
health coverage for achieving the SDGs. Chapter 5
concludes the report by discussing policy options
and priorities for the future of social protection,
harnessing its key role for achieving the SDGs
by 2030.
The annexes to this report present a short
glossary of key terms used in the report (Annex 1);
a description of the methodologies applied
(Annex 2); a summary table of the main minimum
requirements set out in ILO social security
standards (Annex 3); and statistical tables (Annex 4).

12

In this way, both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the extension of social security (ILO 2012) are addressed in an
integrated way in each section of the chapter.

13

General social assistance – that is, non-contributory income support for vulnerable groups – is not considered in a dedicated
section of this report but is addressed throughout, as it features across the range of life-cycle benefits.

chapter 2

The pre-COVID‑19
situation: Some

but significant
gaps remain
This chapter provides an overview of the pre COVID‑19 state of social
protection systems worldwide: their coverage, comprehensiveness
and levels of benefits and expenditure. It highlights progress in
expanding social protection towards SDG target 1.3, as well as the
gaps that remain to be closed.

gaps in coverage, comprehensiveness and adequacy remain.

X Only 46.9 per cent of the global population are effectively covered

by at least one social protection benefit* (SDG indicator 1.3.1), while
the remaining 53.1 per cent – as many as 4.1 billion people – are
left wholly unprotected. Behind this global average there are
significant variations across and within regions, with average
coverage rates in Europe and Central Asia (83.9 per cent) and the
Americas (64.3 per cent) above the global average, while Asia
and the Pacific (44.1 per cent), the Arab States (40.0 per cent) and
Africa (17.4 per cent) have pronounced coverage gaps.

X The lack of protection renders people vulnerable, particularly

informal workers, migrants and the forcibly displaced,
and especially women in those groups who face multiple
discriminations. The rapid extension of social protection coverage
to those not yet adequately covered, through social insurance,
tax-financed schemes or a combination of both, is essential for
reducing their vulnerability and promoting decent work.

X Progressively ensuring comprehensive social protection against

the full range of risks and contingencies is essential to realize the
human right to social security. At present, only 30.6 per cent of
the working-age population are legally covered by comprehensive
social security systems that include the full range of benefits.

X In addition to universal coverage, adequate and comprehensive

social protection benefits are essential for achieving the SDGs.
Extending social protection to those in the informal economy
and facilitating their transition to the formal economy is of key
importance for tackling decent work deficits and alleviating
the pressure on non-contributory social protection provision.
Ensuring adequate social protection for women and men requires
addressing labour market insecurity and inequalities, including
gender gaps in employment and wages, which adversely affect
the capacity to make contributions and therefore benefit levels.
Minimum benefit guarantees or care credits can help to provide
adequate levels of benefit for those with interrupted contribution
histories or low earnings.

X Gaps in the coverage, compre­

hensiveness and adequacy of social
protection systems are associated
with significant underinvestment
in social protection, particularly
in Africa, the Arab States and
Asia. Countries spend on average
12.9 per cent of their GDP on social
protection (excluding health), but this
figure masks staggering variations.
High-income countries spend on
average 16.4 per cent, or twice as
much as upper-middle-income
countries (which spend 8 per cent),
six times as much as lower-middleincome countries (2.5 per cent), and
15 times as much as low-income
countries (1.1 per cent).

X T he f inancing gap in social

protection – that is, the spending
required to close gaps in the
coverage, comprehensiveness and
adequacy of social protection to
ensure at least minimum provision for
all – has increased by approximately
30 per cent since the onset of the
COVID‑19 crisis. To guarantee at
least a basic level of social security
through a nationally defined social
protection floor, lower-middleincome countries would need to
invest an additional US$362.9 billion
and upper-middle-income countries
a further US$750.8 billion per year,
equivalent to 5.1 and 3.1 per cent
of GDP respectively for the two
groups, while low-income countries
would need to invest an additional
US$77.9 billion, equivalent to 15.9 per
cent of their GDP.

protection. Benefits for children and families, and
unemployment benefits, typically come last.

The development of social protection systems
over the past century or so has been remarkable
(figure 2.1). Today, most countries have schemes in
place, anchored in national legislation, that cover
all or most areas of social protection, although in
some cases these cover only a minority of their
populations. Despite this laudable progress,
however, large gaps remain, especially in Africa
and Asia.

While the development of national legal
frameworks is essential for a rights-based
approach, the extension of legal coverage does
not in itself ensure effective

the adequacy of benefits. The

and services. Only if legal coverage is translated
into effective coverage and endowed with a solid
financing framework can social protection systems
function effectively and have positive impacts on
people’s lives.
The key role of social protection systems in
improving people’s living standards and alleviating
poverty is illustrated by the fact that higher social
protection expenditure is associated with lower
poverty levels (see figure 2.2). It can also be
noted that countries with high levels of economic
development and strong institutions have betterdeveloped social protection systems, implying
a path dependency (Barrientos 2010). Economic
history suggests that social protection was critical
in enabling today’s high-income countries – for
example, the Nordic countries – to alleviate
poverty, enhance social cohesion and facilitate
economic development (Palme and Kangas 2005).

Social protection constitutes an important
mechanism for reducing income inequality
and economic insecurity, and supporting both
vertical and horizontal redistribution. Figure 2.3
compares levels of inequality in market incomes,
as measured by the Gini coefficient (combined
green and blue bars), with levels of inequality in
disposable incomes (green bars). The reduction in
inequality achieved by social protection transfers
(dark blue bars) and taxes (light blue bars) varies
significantly. While many European countries
reduce inequality by more than a third through
the combined effects of taxes and transfers,
middle-income countries with less well developed
social protection systems achieve a much smaller
degree of redistribution, resulting in higher
levels of inequality in disposable incomes (with
some exceptions).

2. The pre-COVID‑19 situation: Some progress made, but significant gaps remain

While 77.5 per cent of people above retirement
age receive a pension, thanks to the expansion of
both non-contributory and contributory pensions
(see section 4.3), other branches of provision still
lag behind. Only 26.4 per cent of children globally
receive social protection benefits (section 4.1).
Despite the positive developmental impacts of
supporting childbearing women, only 44.9 per cent
of women with newborns worldwide receive a cash
maternity benefit (section 4.2.2). A mere 18.6 per
cent of unemployed people receive unemployment
cash benefits in the event of job loss, largely owing
to the absence of unemployment protection
schemes (section 4.2.6). The share of people
with severe disabilities worldwide who receive
a disability benefit remains low at 33.5 per cent
(section 4.2.5). Moreover, social assistance cash
benefits are limited and cover only 28.9 per cent
of vulnerable persons, comprising children, people
of working age and older persons not otherwise
protected by contributory schemes.1
In Africa, despite significant progress in extending
social protection coverage, only 17.4 per cent
of the population are effectively covered by at
least one social protection cash benefit, with
significant variation across countries. Owing to
greater efforts to extend old-age protection,
27.1 per cent of Africa’s older population now
receive a pension, and some countries, such as
Botswana, Cabo Verde, Lesotho, Mauritius and
Namibia, have reached, or approached, universal
pension coverage. However, significant coverage
gaps remain across the region with respect to
children, mothers with newborns, unemployed
workers, persons with disabilities and vulnerable
population groups.
In the Americas, 64.3 per cent of the population
are effectively covered by at least one social
protection cash benefit, largely as a result of
major efforts to extend social protection systems
over recent decades. Just over half of children,
pregnant women and mothers of newborns
are covered by social protection cash benefits,
but only 16.4 per cent of unemployed people
receive unemployment benefits. Almost 90 per
cent of older people enjoy pension coverage,
yet benefit levels are often low. Some countries
have successfully achieved universal legal
coverage and high effective coverage of children
(Argentina, Brazil, Chile), mothers with newborns
(Canada, Uruguay), people with disabilities (Brazil,
Chile, United States, Uruguay) and older people
(Argentina, Plurinational State of Bolivia, Canada,
Trinidad and Tobago, United States).

For methodological details, see Annex 2.

In the Arab States, just 40 per cent of the
population are effectively covered by at least
one social protection cash benefit. Significant
coverage gaps remain across the region for older
people, children, people with disabilities, women
with newborns and unemployed workers. This
is the result of segmented and exclusionary
social insurance schemes on the one hand,
and underinvestment in non-contributor y
social protection, which remains fragmented
and narrowly targeted, on the other. Coverage
gaps are particularly large for women, young
and non-national workers, including refugees,
owing to structural barriers associated with
low labour force participation, unemployment
and informal employment. Initiatives that have
had positive impacts include the establishment
of unemploy ment insurance schemes in
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia, and
enhanced coverage for maternity protection
and informal workers in Jordan. The extension
of social protection floors to vulnerable groups
in the region is essential, especially in view of the
substantial social needs and high levels of informal
employment in some countries.
In Asia and the Pacific, only 44.1 per cent of the
population are effectively covered by at least one
social protection cash benefit, although significant
progress has been made in strengthening social
protection systems and building social protection
floors. The regional aggregate, moreover, hides
important disparities both across and within
countries. Older people enjoy the highest coverage
rate in the region, at 73.5 per cent. Pregnant
women and mothers are covered to a lower
extent at 45.9 per cent. Even larger coverage gaps
remain in the areas of child and family benefits,
unemployment protection and disability benefits.
It is, however, worth noting that some countries
have achieved universal or near-universal
coverage of children (Australia, Mongolia), others
have extended maternity protection coverage
(Bangladesh, India, Mongolia), and still others
have introduced and expanded non-contributory
and contributory pension schemes to achieve
universal coverage for older people (China, Japan,
Mongolia, New Zealand, Thailand, Timor-Leste).
In Europe and Central Asia, where social protection
systems are relatively comprehensive and mature,
83.9 per cent of the population have access to at
least one cash social protection benefit. Regional
estimates suggest coverage is 82.3 per cent
for child and family benefits, 83.6 per cent for
maternity cash benefits, 86.0 per cent for disability

benefits and almost 97 per cent for old-age
pensions, with several countries reaching universal
coverage. However, further progress needs to
be made in the extension of unemployment
coverage, as well as the adequacy of pensions
and other social protection benefits, in the light of
demographic changes, macroeconomic pressures
and the socio-economic fallout from COVID‑19.
Despite significant progress in the development
of national social protection floors, vulnerable
population groups face greater challenges than
other sections of the population in accessing
social protection. Globally, only 28.9 per cent
of people considered vulnerable – all children,

along with people of working age and older
people not covered by social insurance – receive
social assistance (figure 2.5). While in Europe
and Central Asia, almost two thirds of vulnerable
people receive non-contributory benefits (64.4 per
cent), this is the case for only 36.7 per cent in the
Americas, 32.2 per cent in the Arab States, 25.3 per
cent in Asia and the Pacific, and 9.3 per cent in
Africa. At the subregional level, coverage data
prompt further concern. In sub-Saharan Africa,
where many of the world’s extremely poor live,
coverage remains very low at 7.1 per cent.
The claim that some countries are too poor to
prioritize social protection is not borne out by

2. The pre-COVID‑19 situation: Some progress made, but significant gaps remain

historical experience that demonstrates the
progressive development of comprehensive
social protection systems. Today, many developing
countries have levels of GDP per capita similar
to those of high-income countries when the
latter started to develop their social protection
provision. For instance, Botswana and Indonesia
today have a similar GDP per capita to that of the
United Kingdom in 1911, when the Government
enacted laws and established the first social
insurance and social assistance programmes.
In short, while higher levels of social protection
coverage are usually associated with countries
that have high levels of economic development,
some other countries, such as Botswana, Cabo
Verde, China and Timor-Leste, have demonstrated
that sustained efforts to extend coverage can
be effective at any level of development. All
countries can pursue a high-road social protection
strategy, starting from their current situation, and
progressively work towards achieving universal
social protection (see sections 3.3, 3.5 and 5.3).

2.2.2 Challenges in
closing coverage gaps
and progress made
Many countries face significant challenges in
closing coverage gaps and achieving universal
social protection, owing to the factors outlined in
section 1.1. Three major challenges in particular
can be identified: extending coverage to workers
who are still uncovered, including those in the
informal and rural economies; ensuring social
protection coverage for migrant workers and the
forcibly displaced;2 and closing gender gaps.

X

Extending coverage to uncovered
workers, including those in the
informal and rural economies

Persistent gaps in social protection coverage for
certain categories of workers constitute a major
challenge for decent work and the achievement
of the SDGs. Depending on national policy and
legal frameworks, part-time, temporary or selfemployed workers may be covered only partially
or not at all. Many of these workers enjoy lower job
and income security, poorer working conditions

and lower social protection coverage than those
in full-time indefinite employment arrangements
(ILO 2016d; ILO and OECD 2020). This is the
case for many workers in so-called “new forms
of employment”, such as workers on digital
platforms (see box 2.1) (ILO 2018d, 2020m, 2021q;
Behrendt, Nguyen, and Rani 2019).
In many countries, gaps in social

in the informal economy, mostly
but not exclusively in developing
countries (ILO 2018f, 2021g). The fact that the
great majority of workers in the informal economy
and their families do not have access to adequate
healthcare and income security, and as a result
are particularly vulnerable to the vagaries of life,
including economic shocks, is both a consequence
and a driver of informality (ILO 2021g).
Most workers in the informal economy are not
affiliated with contributory schemes, nor are they
reached by narrowly targeted “safety nets”, as they
are not considered “poor enough” to qualify for
these; for this reason they are sometimes referred
to as the “missing middle”. Within the broad
category of workers in the informal economy,
there is wide diversity in terms of employment
status (wage worker or self-employed), economic
sector, location (urban or rural) and income
level, to mention just a few factors. To arrive at
a nuanced analysis of social protection coverage
gaps, it is necessary to identify the specific
obstacles that different types of workers may
face in accessing social protection, including legal,
financial, administrative and institutional barriers,
and the policy measures that can help overcome
them (ILO 2021g, 2021p; ILO and FAO 2021).
Drawing on information available in the
Luxembourg Income Study database and national
household surveys for a number of countries
across different income levels, an analysis
of the shares of workers in different types of
employment who contribute to social insurance
schemes was undertaken. The results of the
analysis (shown in figure 2.6) reveal significant
variation in the extent to which workers are

X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

X Box 2.1 Ensuring social protection for workers on digital platforms
More and more work, both locally provided services and geographically dispersed work (“crowdwork”),
is mediated on digital platforms. Yet in many cases, workers in such arrangements are not adequately
protected.
An ILO survey of 20,000 platform workers in 100 countries found that only around 40 per cent of
respondents were covered by health insurance and only 20 per cent had access to employment injury
protection, unemployment protection and old-age pensions (ILO 2021q). The survey results also highlight
another challenge: most platform workers who had access to social protection were not covered through
their economic activity on the platform, but because they had contributed to social insurance through
other current or past employment, or because they were covered through tax-financed programmes,
or through family members (e.g. for health insurance). This implies that the cost of their coverage was
borne by others, including other employers and taxpayers, while the digital platforms themselves largely
avoided contributing to the social protection of the workers active on their platforms. This observation
underlines the need to guarantee a fair competitive environment among economic actors in the “new”
and “old” economies, and across countries.
Such gaps also highlight the need to adapt social protection systems to evolving contexts and demands
by extending adequate protection to workers in all types of employment, taking into account their
specific situations, ensuring fairness, and facilitating labour market transitions and labour mobility. The
policy innovations highlighted in this section and in Chapter 5 can support social protection for workers
on digital platforms in both advanced and emerging economies.

also show considerable diversity across countries
in the share of workers contributing to social

Furthermore, there is substantial variation in the
extent of coverage of workers in different types

that policies matter. While the gap between
coverage of full-time employees and those in
other types of employment is relatively small in
Finland and Sweden, other countries show more
pronounced coverage gaps for certain categories
of workers. Self-employed workers in particular

52

X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

Many countries have extended social protection
coverage by addressing the various barriers that
prevent some groups of workers from being
protected, such as exclusion from legal coverage,
weak compliance, limited contributory capacities,
low and volatile earnings, lack of incentives to
join and complex administrative procedures (ILO
2021g). Successful examples of the extension
of social protection coverage to workers in the
informal economy have focused on a combination
of social insurance and tax-financed schemes.
The extension of social insurance usually starts
with categories of workers who have some
contributory capacity. In some cases, inclusive
solutions can be supported by subsidizing
low-income workers from the government
budget. It is particularly important to adapt
social insurance to the specific characteristics
of workers, for example by taking into account
seasonality in designing contribution modalities
for rural workers and producers. Examples of
such measures include Brazil’s rural pension
scheme; partnerships with cooperatives and
professional associations in Costa Rica and the
Philippines; the introduction of contribution
categories to facilitate social insurance coverage
of the self-employed in Cabo Verde and Mongolia;
the establishment of a scheme for non-salaried
workers in Algeria; measures to facilitate the
coverage of domestic workers by maternity and
unemployment insurance in South Africa; the
extension of health protection through adapted
contributions in Rwanda; and the facilitation of
microenterprise registration and tax/contribution
collection through monotax mechanisms in
Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay (ILO 2021g; ILO
and FAO 2021). While these are all examples
of mandatory coverage, other countries have
opened social insurance to informal economy
workers and micro-entrepreneurs on a voluntary
basis, though with more limited success. Several
countries have also focused on raising awareness
about social security rights and obligations. For
example, in Uruguay, social security education
is mainstreamed in school curricula, as well as
in vocational training and entrepreneurship
programmes. Partnerships with workers’ and
employers’ organizations, including rural workers’
organizations, as well as with representatives

of other concerned groups, are also essential
for outreach campaigns and to facilitate the
interaction between the State and individuals.

that investing in people through social protection
contributes to social and economic development,
and enables workers and entrepreneurs to benefit
from the opportunities offered in a changing world
of work.
Recognizing that the future of work requires
fair, inclusive and sustainable social protection
systems, a number of countries have taken
measures to ensure adequate protection for
workers in all types of employment. This includes
facilitating the portability of entitlements,
and safeguarding financial, fiscal and social
sustainability and a sufficiently large degree
of redistribution through a mix of taxes and
contributions (ILO 2021g; OECD 2019). For
example, the European Union’s Pillar of Social
Rights (2017) stipulates that workers – and, under
comparable conditions, the self-employed – have
a right to adequate social protection, regardless
of the type and duration of their employment
relationship; this principle was given concrete
form by a Recommendation adopted in 2019. 5
The G20 have also made a joint commitment to
promoting adequate social protection and social
security coverage for all workers, including those
in diverse forms of employment (G20 2017). There
are many options for extending coverage to
workers in insecure employment (see box 2.2).

“Quasi-universal” benefits are very close to being universal, providing high coverage and excluding (often intentionally) only
the wealthiest.

4

“Social pensions” are tax-financed, non-contributory pensions not based on the individual’s work or contribution history but
paid as a universal entitlement, with a social goal such as poverty reduction or redistribution.

2. The pre-COVID‑19 situation: Some progress made, but significant gaps remain

X Box 2.2 Adaptations to facilitate extension of social protection

to workers in all types of employment

Several countries have adapted mechanisms in various ways to enable social protection coverage to be
extended to self-employed workers and workers in diverse forms of employment. These adaptations
include the following:
X Measures to tailor registration, contribution collection and benefit payment mechanisms to the

circumstances and needs of specific categories of workers. Such measures may include reducing the
requirements for proof documents (as in Brazil), modified contribution rates (as in Jordan) or simplified
tax and contribution collection mechanisms, with a view to ensuring the protection of all workers
and a fair competitive environment for enterprises. For example, in Belgium and France, digital
labour platforms share information with tax authorities about workers’ incomes. Tax payments are
then collected by the fiscal authority, and the corresponding share of social security contributions is
transferred to the social security institution (ESIP 2019). It is important to note, however, that such
measures need to give due respect to protection of privacy and data.

X Measures to prevent misclassification and curb disguised employment. One of the essential issues in

closing coverage gaps for self-employed workers is the clarification of their employment relationships.
Italy, for example, has taken steps to gradually harmonize the contribution rates and prospective
benefits of dependent self-employed workers with those of salaried workers in order to avoid
disincentives for employers to hire workers on terms of salaried employment (ISSA 2019).

X Measures to enhance coordination and reduce fragmentation in social security systems to help

ensure the portability and transferability of entitlements for geographically or occupationally mobile
workers. Recognizing that this objective is best met through inclusive social protection systems
covering workers in all types of employment, a number of countries have integrated the self-employed
into their general social insurance schemes. For example, Argentina and Brazil extended coverage
through monotributo mechanisms which allow certain categories of self-employed workers to pay
social security contributions and taxes in a simplified way (ILO 2021h).

X Measures to ensure coverage of workers with multiple employers and workers on digital platforms. In

Slovakia, an “every job counts” approach ensures that workers in all types of employment, including
self-employment, are included in the social security system (Pesole et al. 2018).

Nevertheless, more efforts need to be directed
into a better coordinated and integrated policy
response to ensure that protection mechanisms
are well adapted to the circumstances and needs
of workers of all kinds, and that coverage and
adequacy gaps are closed. At the same time,
the impact of such measures also depends on
the effectiveness of overall labour regulation,
particularly with respect to preventing the
misclassification of employment relationships,
setting and administering minimum wages, and
monitoring working conditions.

X

Ensuring social security
for migrant workers
and forcibly displaced people

Migrant workers and the forcibly displaced, and
their families, face specific challenges with respect
to access to social protection, owing to restrictive
legal frameworks, administrative regulations and
other practical barriers, and a lack of coordination

between and within countries of origin and
destination. In addition, many migrants, especially
women, work in economic sectors that tend to be
characterized by relatively weak social security
coverage, such as domestic work, agriculture
or construction, where part-time, temporary
or seasonal work is very common. An ILO study
assessing the situation in 120 countries found
that in only 70 of those countries did national laws
grant equality of treatment between national and
non-nationals with regard to contributory social
security arrangements (Panhuys, Kazi-Aoul,
and Binette 2017). Low levels of compliance and
weak enforcement can further undermine the
protection of migrant workers.
Ensuring that migrant workers are accorded
equality of treatment with nationals in social
security systems is essential, both to protect
migrants’ right to social security and to avoid
adverse labour market effects. International social
security standards provide an international legal
framework for the protection of migrant workers’

53

54

X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

social security rights according to basic principles,
which include equality of treatment between
national and non-nationals; maintenance of
acquired rights and provisions of benefits in both
host country and country of origin; determination
of the applicable legislation;6 and maintenance of
rights in the course of acquisition (Hirose, Nikac,
and Tamagno 2011, 8).7 While many countries have
concluded bilateral or multilateral social security
agreements to provide for the portability of social
protection rights and benefits between host
countries and countries of origin, the effective
coverage of existing agreements is still relatively
limited (Panhuys, Kazi-Aoul, and Binette 2017).
To provide or enhance access to social protection
for migrant workers not yet accorded equality of
treatment, countries could adopt other unilateral
measures (ILO, forthcoming a). The Overseas
Development Institute (ODI) estimates that
only 23 per cent of migrants moving between
countries are covered by a bilateral or multilateral
social security agreement, while 55 per cent are
entitled to some social protection provision
though not covered by an agreement, and the
remaining 22 per cent have no access to social
protection at all (Hagen-Zanker, Mosler Vidal, and
Sturge 2017).
Recent internationally agreed texts (UN 2015b,
2018; ILO 2019e, 2017d) have explicitly highlighted
the importance of social protection for migrants
and renewed the call for enhanced access to
and portability of provision. Complementary
measures aimed at addressing practical obstacles,
including communication campaigns, social and
legal services, the facilitation of registration,
migration-sensitive health services, pre-departure
training and the availability of materials in relevant
languages are also crucial.
In humanitarian contexts, the aim of development
par tners should be to work with relevant
national and international institutions not to
replace existing systems but to enhance their
capacity to deliver benefits and services and to
orient humanitarian interventions towards the
longer-term objectives of creating rights-based
social protection and employment entitlements,
building up local and institutional capacities, and
strengthening the resilience of social protection
systems against future shocks.

X

Closing coverage gaps for women

Women still experience significantly lower social
protection coverage than men, a discrepancy that
largely reflects and reproduces their lower labour
force participation rates, higher levels of part-time
and temporary work and of informal employment
(especially informal self-employment), gender
pay gaps and a disproportionately high share
of unpaid care work, which national social
protection strategies often fail to recognize
(ILO and UN Women 2019). These outcomes are
associated with persistent patterns of inequality,
discrimination and structural disadvantage.
Improving social protection provision for women
remains a paramount goal of work in this field (see
section 4.1, box 4.4).
The expansion of tax-financed pensions in many
parts of the world (for instance in Kenya, Namibia,
Nepal and South Africa) has helped to guarantee
at least a basic level of income security for many
older women who did not have the opportunity to
contribute to pension schemes when of working
age. However, women who rely exclusively on taxfinanced pensions often struggle with low benefit
levels. In addition, where tax-financed pensions
are means-tested at the household level, many
older women may still not benefit from this source
of income because of narrow eligibility criteria
or stigmatization (ILO 2017f, 2016f). Genderresponsive contributory pensions that are based
on collective financing and solidarity play a key
role in providing adequate pension coverage for
women, particularly if they include care credits
to recognize and reward periods spent caring for
children or other family members, and guarantee
minimum pensions in line with international social
security standards (Fultz 2011; Behrendt and
Woodall 2015).
Despite the importance of maternity cash benefits
and maternity healthcare for ensuring the health
and well-being of women and their babies, many
women, particularly those in self-employment
and in vulnerable forms of employment, are
not sufficiently covered. Several countries have
made efforts to close or at least reduce coverage
and adequacy gaps and to promote gender
equality in employment: examples include the
replacement of employer liability mechanisms

6

This means ensuring, by establishing the rules for determining the applicable legislation, that the social security protection
of a migrant worker is governed at any one time by the legislation of one country only.

7

This means that any acquired right, or right in course of acquisition, should be guaranteed to the migrant worker in one
territory, even if it has been acquired in another, and that there should be no restriction on the payment, in any of the
countries concerned, of benefits for which the migrant has qualified in any of the others.

2. The pre-COVID‑19 situation: Some progress made, but significant gaps remain

by collectively financed social insurance and the
financing of childcare as part of the maternity
insurance scheme in Jordan (ILO 2017f, 2021a);
the extension of social insurance coverage to
additional categories of workers in South Africa
and Viet Nam; and the strengthening of social
assistance benefits for those not covered by social
insurance in Mozambique (ILO 2016c, 2017f). While
significant gaps still remain, the introduction of
paternity leave and gender-equitable parental
leave also contributes to the greater involvement
of fathers in child-rearing and a fairer sharing
of family responsibilities, especially if men’s
uptake of leave is encouraged by reserving a
non-transferable portion of parental leave for the
father. At the same time, sustained investment in
affordable and good-quality childcare services
that are adapted to the needs of working parents
can be a real game-changer: it can reduce the
childcare burden on families, disproportionately
assumed by women, and thereby facilitate
women’s employment, while also creating decent
jobs in the care sector (ILO 2018a).
Laudable progress has been made in the area of
social health protection for women, with a number
of countries prioritizing the provision of free or
more easily affordable good-quality prenatal
and postnatal care (Sen, Govender, and El-Gamal
2020). However, the inclusion of reproductive

X

health needs in “essential service packages”
has tended to be selective, often ignoring the
reproductive rights of adolescent girls and older
women. Moreover, women’s effective access
to social health protection is impeded by a
range of barriers that reflect, depending on the
national context, their employment status, their
contributory capacity and/or the extent to which
societal norms allow them to make decisions
about their own health. In addition, coverage
gaps, for example in long-term care provision,
often disproportionately affect women, who
both make up a bigger share of those who need
care, given their overall greater longevity, and are
burdened with additional unpaid work caring for
others that further thwarts their participation in
paid employment and access to
social security coverage.
Overall, persistent gender gaps
in the reach and adequacy of
social protection coverage call
for more gender-responsive
social protection policies. These
need to be complemented
by e f f or t s to ensure t he
availability, accessibility and
quality of public services, such
as childcare and long-term
care provision.

2.3 Adequacy and comprehensiveness of protection

While the world has achieved considerable
progress in the extension of social protection
coverage in many areas, ensuring the adequacy
of benefits remains a major challenge in many
regions. At issue here are, first and foremost, the
range and scope of available benefits, the levels
of cash benefits, and the comprehensiveness
and quality of health benefit packages; a number
of other aspects, such as eligibility criteria, the
predictability of benefits and the duration of
benefit payments, are also significant.
Only a minority of the working-age population
enjoys comprehensive social protection coverage.
According to ILO estimates, just 30.6 per cent of
the working-age population are legally covered
by comprehensive social security systems that
include the full range of benefits, from child and
family benefits to old-age pensions, with women’s
coverage lagging behind men’s by a very wide
margin of 8 percentage points (see table 2.1). This

55

implies that the large majority of the working-age
population – 69.4 per cent, or 4 billion people – are
not protected at all, or only partially protected.
The range of social protection provisions, and the
minimum considered socially acceptable, vary
across societies and depend on the prevailing
attitudes on such matters as the distribution
of responsibilities bet ween the State and
the individual; redistribution arrangements,
including suppor t for the poor and the
vulnerable; and intergenerational solidarity.
The principles set out in ILO Recommendation
No. 202 and Convention No. 102 reflect an
internationally accepted rights-based approach
based on entitlements prescribed by national
law, ensuring the adequacy and predictability
of benefits (ILO 2017f, 2021c). The guarantees
provided in a social protection floor set a basic
adequacy benchmark for social protection
systems (see box 1.1). Guaranteeing such a basic

level of income security and access to healthcare
requires a careful setting of benefit levels, so as
to prevent hardship and enable lives to be lived
in dignity both at present and in the future, on
the basis of a transparent and participatory
process. In respect of basic income security,
Recommendation No. 202 (Para. 8) refers to
nationally defined minimum income thresholds,
such as national pover t y lines or income
thresholds for social assistance. In respect of
health care, it stipulates that persons in need of
essential care should not face financial hardship
and an increased risk of poverty when accessing
it. In view of the multidimensionality of poverty,
it is essential that the provision of adequate and
predictable cash benefits is considered alongside
that of high-quality services, including education,
housing, healthcare, long-term care, water and
nutrition (European Commission 2015).
While a social protection floor is essential in
guaranteeing a basic level of protection, if social
protection systems are to function optimally they
need to provide adequate levels of protection to
as many people as possible, and as promptly as
possible. The minimum requirements set out in
Convention No. 102 and in more advanced social
security standards (see Annex 2) for all nine
policy areas provide an internationally accepted
framework for assessing the adequacy of social
protection systems (ILO 2021c). For example,
for old-age, disability and survivors’ pensions,
the Invalidity, Old-Age and Survivors’ Benefits
Convention, 1967 (No. 128), and the Invalidity,
Old-Age and Survivors’ Benefits Recommendation,

1967 (No. 131), set adequacy standards for pension
benefits, including for their revision following
substantial changes in earnings levels or the cost
of living. Annex 3 to this report summarizes the
minimum requirements for all nine areas (see also
ILO 2021c).
In practice, however, benefit levels in many
social security schemes remain below minimum
adequacy standards. For example, as shown in
figure 2.8, in many countries the level of noncontributory old-age pensions is set at less than
50 per cent of the value of the national poverty
line: that is, the pension is not sufficient to prevent
old-age poverty. As a result, older people in these
countries who rely on a social pension for their
income are still poor.
Among the challenges
countries face in ensuring the
adequacy of social protection

high levels of labour market
insecurity and informality,
as well as gender gaps in

adequate benefits. For social insurance schemes,
redistributive elements, such as minimum benefit
guarantees or care credits, offer the possibility
to provide higher benefit levels for those with
interrupted contribution histories and/or low
earnings, many of whom are women. Such
redistributive elements do not exist, however, in
private pensions and individual savings schemes,
which therefore have no or limited means to
guarantee adequate benefits for those struggling
with low and volatile earnings, often leading to
stark gender inequalities.
Yet high levels of labour market insecurity and
informality can also hamper non-contributory
schemes, by diminishing the capacity of the
Government to mobilize and allocate sufficient
resources from its budget to ensure at least a
basic level of protection.

One crucial factor in ensuring the adequacy of
social protection benefits is political support.
Programmes with broad coverage, whether
contributory or not, tend to attract stronger
political support than programmes that cater to
smaller groups of the population, such as narrowly
targeted programmes for the poor (Kidd 2015;
Kabeer 2014). Such political support is essential
to ensure adequate benefit levels and to avoid
programmes for the poor becoming (or remaining)
poor programmes.
Ensuring the adequacy of social protection
benefits is essential for achieving the SDGs. A
failure to attend properly to this imperative will
jeopardize the achievements of the poverty
reduction goals of the 2030 Agenda.

Prior to COVID‑19, countries
spent on average 12.9 per
cent of their GDP on social
protection (excluding health),
with staggering variations
across regions and income
groups (figures 2.9 and 2.10).
Significantly, high-income countries spend on
average 16.4 per cent, or twice as much as uppermiddle-income countries (which spend 8 per
cent), six times as much as lower-middle-income

Region

countries (2.5 per cent), and 15 times as much as
low-income countries (1.1 per cent). Pronounced
differences are also evident between regions, with
proportions of GDP ranging from 17.4 per cent
in Europe and Central Asia and 16.6 per cent in
the Americas to 7.5 per cent in Asia and the
Pacific, 4.6 per cent in the Arab States and
3.8 per cent in Africa. Similarly stark differences
prevail in domestic general government health
expenditure, with a global average of 5.8 per
cent of GDP concealing wide disparities between
regions and country income levels (figures 2.10
and 2.11).
Overall, there is a positive correlation between
levels of economic development and investment
in social protection. More interestingly, however,
there are sizeable differences in social protection
investment among countries at the same level
of economic development (or countries with
government budgets of similar size), indicating
that there is some scope for policy choice
regardless of the economic capacity of a country
(Ortiz et al. 2019, 29).

Just as the COVID‑19 crisis has revealed stark gaps
in social protection coverage, comprehensiveness
and adequacy, it has also underscored the
exigency of investing further in social protection
systems, and especially in social protection
floors that can guarantee at least a basic level
of income security and access to healthcare for
all. Comparing the cost of a set of benefits that
could constitute a social protection floor with
current spending on social assistance generates
estimates of the financing gap to be closed
if SDG targets 1.3 and 3.8 are to be achieved
(Durán Valverde et al. 2019, 2020). Factoring in
the impact of COVID‑19, low-income countries
would need to invest an additional US$77.9 billion
or 15.9 per cent of their GDP to close the annual

financing gap (Durán Valverde et al. 2020). Lowermiddle-income countries would need to invest
an additional US$362.9 billion and upper-middleincome countries an extra US$750.8 billion,
equivalent to 5.1 and 3.1 per cent of GDP
respectively. Regionally, the relative financing
gap is particularly high in Central and Western
Asia, Northern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa
(9.3, 8.3 and 8.2 per cent of GDP respectively) (see
figure 2.12). The magnitude of this challenge is
further underscored by comparing it to current
levels of tax revenue. According to the OECD
Global Revenue Statistics Database, tax revenue
as a percentage of GDP in 2018 was on average
16.6 per cent in African countries, compared
to 34.3 per cent in OECD countries.

2. The pre-COVID‑19 situation: Some progress made, but significant gaps remain

Clearly, then, current levels of expenditure
on social protection are insufficient to close
persistent coverage gaps, despite large – yet
unequal – resource mobilization during COVID‑19
(see section 3.2). Limited fiscal space in developing
countries has manifested itself in a “stimulus gap”,
whereby lower-middle-income
countries mustered only a tiny
fraction of the fiscal stimulus
measures mobilized in highCurrent levels of
income countries (ILO 2020k).

cumulative effects of fiscal
responses to the COVID‑19
crisis and its economic repercussions are expected
to be even larger in the longer run (ILO 2020k).
Countries will need to invest in social protection
(given its well-known multiplier effects) to reverse
the recessionary spiral that currently grips their
economies, despite the short-term erosion of
government finances as a result of diminished
tax revenues and social insurance contributions.
At the same time, it will be essential that
development partners and international financial
institutions (IFIs) contribute to creating an
environment that is conducive to increasing
fiscal space at the domestic level. A pertinent
recent development is the IMF’s promulgation of
its strategy for engagement on social spending
(defined as public spending on social protection,
health and education), which recognizes its
importance for inclusive growth (IMF 2019, 2020b).
There is no one -size -f its-all approach to
extending fiscal space for social protection.
ILO Recommendation No. 202 calls upon countries
to consider different ways of mobilizing the
necessary resources. Countries need to invest
more and better in social protection, on the
basis of principles of universality, adequacy,
sustainability and solidarity. Not only the design
and implementation of social protection systems,
including floors, but also decisions on their
financing need to be guided by effective social
dialogue. International experience shows that
countries can draw on eight different strategies
for creating fiscal space (Ortiz et al. 2019):

1. Extending social security coverage and
increasing contributory revenues. This is
a reliable way to finance social protection,
f re ein g f is c al sp a ce f or ot he r s o cial
expenditure. Social protection benefits linked
to employment-based contributions also
encourage the formalization of the informal
economy. Uruguay’s Monotax provides a
remarkable example of this effect; Argentina,
Brazil and Tunisia have also demonstrated the
feasibility of broadening both coverage and
contributions.
2. Increasing tax revenues. Taxation is a
key channel for generating government
revenue, and higher takings can be achieved
by increasing the rates for certain types of
taxes – for example, taxes on corporate profits,
financial activities, property, inheritance,
imports/exports and natural resources – or by
strengthening the efficiency of tax collection
methods and of overall compliance. Many
countries are increasing taxes specifically for
social protection, or raising revenues through
innovative taxes. The Plurinational State of
Bolivia, Mongolia and Zambia finance universal
pensions, child benefits and other schemes from
taxes on mining and natural gas. Ghana, Liberia
and the Maldives have introduced tourism taxes
to support social programmes, while Gabon
has used revenues from value-added tax on
mobile communications to finance its universal
healthcare system. Algeria, Mauritius and
Panama, among others, have supplemented
social security revenues with a high tax on
tobacco; and before 2008, Brazil applied a
temporary tax on financial transactions to
expand social protection coverage.
3. Eliminating illicit financial flows. Success
in this would alone free up more than ten
times the annual total of official development
assistance (ODA) disbursed and received across
the globe. Such is the amount of resources
that illegally escapes developing countries
every year. There are increased efforts to
crack down on money laundering, bribery, tax
evasion, trade mispricing and other financial
crimes that are not only illegal but also reduce
much-needed revenues for social protection
and work towards the SDGs. For Egypt, the
ILO estimates that combating illicit financial
outflows could on average generate an annual
amount equivalent to 3 per cent of GDP; illicit
financial outflows from the country in 2014
were estimated at between 1.9 per cent and
4.7 per cent of GDP (Ortiz et al. 2019).

61

62

X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

4. Reallocating public expenditure and
enhancing the quality of spending. This
can be achieved by assessing ongoing budget
allocations through public expenditure
reviews, social budgeting and other types
of budget analysis; replacing high-cost, lowimpact investments with investments that
result in more substantial socio-economic
impacts; eliminating spending inefficiencies;
and tackling corruption. For example, Costa
Rica and Thailand have reallocated military
expenditures to universal healthcare.
Enhancing spending qualit y refer s to
improvements in the design and performance
of social protection programmes. Costa Rica
again provides an example, having introduced
a new healthcare model that strengthened
preventive measures and health promotion,
leading to substantial improvements in
spending effectiveness in terms of health
outcomes.
5. Using fiscal and foreign exchange reserves.
This can be done by drawing down fiscal
savings and other state revenues stored in
special funds (for example, sovereign wealth
funds), and/or using excess foreign exchange
reserves in the central bank for domestic and
regional development.

6. M a n a g i n g s ove r e i g n d e b t t h r o u g h
b orrow ing and deb t re s truc turing .
This involves actively exploring low-cost
domestic and foreign borrowing options,
including concessional loans, following
careful assessment of debt sustainability. For
example, in 2017 Colombia became the first
developing country to launch a social impact
bond, while South Africa has issued municipal
bonds to finance basic services and urban
infrastructure.
7. A more accommodating macroeconomic
framework. This can permit higher budget
deficit paths and/or higher levels of inflation
without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability.
A significant number of developing countries
have been using such frameworks, along with
deficit spending, during the COVID‑19 crisis.
8. Increasing aid and transfers. Despite calls
for enhanced ODA to support financing for
sustainable development (UN 2015a), and
agreement on a target commitment of 0.7 per
cent of gross national income (GNI), ODA
in fact represented only 0.3 per cent of the
combined GNI of the member countries of
the Development Assistance Committee in
2019 (OECD 2021). Not only did donor countries
fall short of their commitments; the share of
their actual disbursements of ODA allocated to
social protection in 2017 represented a mere
0.0047 per cent of their GNI (ILO 2020g).

X The pandemic has exposed pronounced gaps in social protection

coverage, comprehensiveness and adequacy across all countries. These
have left a number of population groups, including women, children
and workers in different forms of employment and in the informal
economy, very vulnerable.

X There has been an unprecedented social protection response to the

pandemic, with many countries introducing, scaling up or adapting
social protection measures to protect previously uncovered or
inadequately covered population groups.

X While all countries faced challenges to respond rapidly, those that

already had strong social protection systems were able to guarantee
access to much-needed healthcare, ensure income security and protect
jobs. Countries without sufficiently strong systems in place have had
to adopt measures under duress, sometimes with a fair amount of
improvisation and teething problems.

X The crisis has confirmed the urgent need to guarantee at least a basic

level of social security for all throughout their lives. It is therefore
essential that the measures announced to cope with the emergency
do not remain a mere stopgap response, but lead towards the
establishment or strengthening of rights-based national social
protection systems, including floors.

X Countries are not without choice in how they respond to this crisis

and how they formulate their social protection policies going forward.
Nearly all countries, at all levels of development, can pursue a highroad strategy towards achieving universal social protection, and now
is the time to set out on this route. Doing so will require continued and
increased investment in social protection, ensuring financial and fiscal
sustainability by drawing on a mix of financing sources.

X The COVID‑19 crisis was uncharted territory. Governments had to

suspend economic activity to contain the spread of the virus and protect
lives, consigning the world to an economic recession of unprecedented
magnitude. This chapter focuses on the pandemic’s socio-economic
impact, and on the policy response to it that mobilized significant
resources to close social protection gaps. It argues that countries find
themselves today at an important crossroads. From this point, States
will have to choose between the high road of reinforcing their social
protection systems to progressively close protection gaps and secure
sustainability in line with ILO standards, and the low road of falling back
to unreliable safety nets under the pressure of fiscal consolidation. A
human-centred approach to recovery and the future of work requires
increased efforts to build universal, comprehensive, adequate and
sustainable social protection systems, including a solid social protection
floor that guarantees at least a basic level of social security for all.

3.1 COVID‑19 exposed inequalities
and critical protection gaps

In 2020, 8.8 per cent of global working hours
were lost relative to the fourth quarter of 2019,
equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs (ILO
2021k). While these massive employment losses
fell hardest on certain sectors, such as hospitality,
culture, retail and tourism, other sectors (such as
information and communications, and financial
and insurance activities) actually benefited
greatly. Similarly, the crisis had a
disproportionately severe impact
on low- and medium-skilled workers

inequalities in the years to come (ILO

“have nots”, and between those who
could work from home and those who could not.
While hundreds of millions have lost their incomes
and livelihoods, the world’s ten richest individuals
have seen their combined wealth increase by half
a trillion dollars since the start of the COVID‑19
outbreak (Berkhout et al. 2021).
The crisis has exposed and exacerbated deeprooted labour market and structural socioeconomic inequalities within and across countries.
Evidence already shows that the crisis-induced
labour income losses have been unevenly
distributed across workers and sectors. The full
economic and social impact has yet to unfold: this
will become clearer as emergency measures will
be lifted, while further inequalities are entering
the picture with pronounced variation in access to
vaccines and the ability to continue financing fiscal
stimulus measures (see section 3.3.2).
The pandemic has also had particularly severe
ef fec t s for vulnerable groups and those
lacking social securit y coverage owing to
pre-existing social inequalities. Intersecting
health and social inequalities and increased
morbidity (and comorbidities) have accounted
for disproportionately high rates of infections
and fatalities in ethnic minority communities
(Razai et al. 2021) and lower-income groups
(Marmot et al. 2020). This reflects systemic
racism and discrimination in important social
services, and exclusion from decent work and
access to healthcare (Kidd 2020). Moreover,

pre-COVID‑19 austerity increased the virus’s
effects by weakening these population groups’
general health before the crisis erupted (Marmot
et al. 2020).
Several other groups have been severely and
disproportionately affected by the pandemic. For
instance, indigenous peoples and people with
disabilities found that pre-existing barriers and
inequalities were further accentuated by COVID‑19
(De Schutter 2020; Lustig et al. 2020; UNPRPD et
al. 2020). Migrants and the forcibly displaced were
among the first to lose their jobs in the pandemic,
and now face significant barriers to re-entering
the workforce. They also confront multiple
hurdles in accessing social protection, owing
to a lack of citizenship or legal residency status,
and in many cases the informal nature of their
employment, and many are compelled to return
to their countries of origin or to live in insanitary
and overcrowded conditions, increasing their
susceptibility to contracting the virus (ILO 2020t).
The pandemic ’s uneven ef fec ts have also
compounded pre-existing gender inequality.
Women have been more adversely affected by
the decline in employment than men because
they were disproportionately employed in sectors
hardest hit by the shutdowns (ILO 2020k, 2021k).
Yet while for many women economic activity
has been halted, many others have seen their
workloads increased and intensified, especially
those in paid care work. Women comprise 70 per
cent of the health workforce, including the large
majority of front-line workers; many of them have
had to work without adequate personal protective
equipment, heightening their risk of exposure to
the virus (ILO 2019f, 2020c). In addition, with the
closure of childcare services, schools and longterm care homes, much of the responsibility of
caring for young children and frail older people has
been shifted on to families, and disproportionately
on to women (ILO 2020k; UN 2020c; UN Women
2020c). Finally, confinement has seen domestic
violence increase in both frequency and severity
(UN Women 2020b).
The evidence demonstrates that health and
economic crises have disproportionate effects
on children, too (UNICEF 2020e; Tirivayi et al.
2020). Given the closure of schools, universities
and childcare services, the more than 800 million
children and young people affected by such

67

68

X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

closures in 2020 (UNESCO 2020a) are likely to
experience substantial social scarring as a result
of the pandemic (Dasgupta and Chacaltana 2021).
The aphorism that the true measure of a society is
displayed by how well it treats its most vulnerable
members gains particular force in the context
of COVID‑19. Held against this yardstick, many
societies fall short. Ultimately, the pandemic’s
highly uneven effects have exacerbated existing
inequalities and are leaving many countries more
unequal than when they entered the crisis. It is
therefore incumbent on States both to ensure the
continuation of an adequate emergency response
to the crisis for its full duration and to develop a
longer-term high-road strategy for strengthening
social protection systems as the crisis abates.
When COV ID‑19 hit, only approximately a
third of the global population had access to
comprehensive social protection systems.
The pandemic quickly revealed the significant
coverage, comprehensiveness and adequacy gaps
in social protection systems across all countries
(ILO 2020f, 2020w). Consequently, policymakers
were compelled to extend and bolster their
existing social protection systems.

X

While the crisis has hit whole societies, it has
affected some people far more than others.
This includes many of the 2 billion workers in the
informal economy, 1.6 billion of whom work in
the most adversely affected sectors, and most
of whom are neither affiliated with contributory
schemes nor reached by narrowly targeted social
assistance (ILO 2020f, 2020d, 2020w). Moreover,
people with disabilities, young people, migrants,
part-time and temporary employees, and selfemployed workers were particularly hard hit.
The pandemic starkly exposed the consequences
of inadequate access to quality healthcare (ILO
2020w). Before the crisis, half of the global
population did not have access to health services,
and about 40 per cent were not affiliated to a
national social health insurance system or national
health service. Many people have had to make
significant out-of-pocket payments to get the
treatment they need (ILO 2017f; WHO and World
Bank 2017). The crisis also exposed the limited
progress made in building and strengthening
social protection floors that guarantee access to
essential healthcare and basic income security for
all throughout the life cycle (ILO 2021o).

3.2 Crisis response: Rapid extension of coverage
and adaptation of social protection systems

3.2.1 Ensuring access
to healthcare and income
security during the crisis
More than any recent economic crisis, the
COVID‑19 pandemic has reinforced the need for
comprehensive social protection systems. In 2020,
virtually all countries and territories took action; in
total, just over 1,600 social protection measures
were announced (see figure 3.1). Countries with
solid social protection systems in place before the
crisis could rely on pre-existing statutory schemes
that automatically fulfilled their protective
function, while injecting further financing where
needed and focusing on emergency programmes
to help groups in need of additional support.
Countries with weaker social protection systems
faced greater challenges. In addition to relying on
pre-existing statutory schemes, many of these
countries had to urgently fill gaps by introducing
new measures or extending the coverage,

comprehensiveness and adequacy of benefits,
and to adapt delivery mechanisms to accord with
public health objectives.
The measures announced covered all functions of
social protection (see figure 3.2). Approximately
three quarters of these measures comprised
non-contributory responses, the remainder being
delivered through contributory schemes. For the
latter especially, social dialogue played a role in
guiding the policy response (ILO 2021o, box 3,
2020p, 2021j; de Lima Vieira, Vicente Andrés, and
Monteiro 2020).
The discussion below and figure 3.3 provide an
overview of some of the policy actions taken
and specific measures introduced, supported
by country examples from across the world.
COVID‑19 social protection responses can be
broadly grouped into four areas, each containing
more specific measures, as illustrated by the
following typology of policy actions.

with disabilities.

Across these different policy areas, countries have
put in place extraordinary fiscal stimulus measures
to finance social protection responses to COVID‑19.
As of March 2021, more than 196 countries had
introduced domestic fiscal measures with a
total value of approximately US$17.1 trillion (not
limited to social protection) (ILO, forthcoming b).
Global fiscal stimuli, however, have been strongly
concentrated in high-income countries. In lowerincome countries, domestic efforts have been
backed by pledges from IFIs and development
cooperation agencies, amounting to US$1.3 trillion
as of 1 February 2021 (ILO, forthcoming b). In some
countries, this included the setting up of solidarity
or “basket” funds cofinanced by governments and
international partners, for instance in Bangladesh,
Côte d’Ivoire, Jordan, Nigeria and Togo, sometimes
with longer-term solutions already in mind.

3.2.2 Emerging policy
observations and
lessons learned
Effective policymaking in a protracted, fastmoving and complex crisis is challenging.
Nonetheless, several observations can be made
as to what constituted a sound policy response
to the COVID‑19 pandemic, and what lessons can
be gleaned.
The crisis has poignantly

social protec tion, anyone
can “ fall” into pover t y and
insecurity. The crisis exposed the shortcomings
of limited coverage and low benefit levels, with
narrow targeting, problematic proxy means
tests and behavioural conditions, especially in
contexts where large parts of the population
are vulnerable and administrative capacity is
constrained, to an even greater degree than
in non-crisis times (Brown, Ravallion, and Van
de Walle 2016). Consequently, many eligibility
requirements were relaxed during the crisis to
ensure high take-up and protect people’s health.
COVID‑19 made it impossible for policymakers
to ignore the “missing middle” and unpaid
carers. Countries where large parts of the
population, including workers in the informal
economy and unpaid carers, were covered
either inadequately or not at all had to adopt ad
hoc measures; this often entailed a fair degree
of improvisation, with hit-and-miss results.
Furthermore, many of these emergency benefits
were limited in terms of adequacy and paid for
only a short period (Gentilini, Almenfi, et al. 2020),
soon leaving people vulnerable and unprotected
once more. This raises the troubling spectre of
a benefit “cliff fall” scenario, wherein support
ends prematurely and more profound structural
challenges, such as persistent labour market
informality, remain unaddressed. Moreover, many
social protection responses were not aligned
with international social security standards

(see further below). On a more positive note,
innovations developed during the crisis response
phase, especially those aimed at reaching hitherto
uncovered population groups, could provide a
basis for future policy choices. These observations
highlight the need to build universal social
protection systems that can adequately protect
all people across the life cycle and against shocks.

stabilizer.
Social protection systems have
provided an indispensable
front-line response, supporting preventive public
health measures and objectives, and protecting
incomes and jobs, thereby serving as a powerful
social and economic stabilizer. Countries that
already had comprehensive systems in place
covering large parts of their populations were
able to more rapidly use and adapt existing
schemes and delivery mechanisms to facilitate
access to healthcare, ensure income security and
protect jobs, and extend existing schemes or new
programmes to previously uncovered populations.
Pre-existing statutory schemes automatically
fulfilled their protective function, while further
financing was injected where needed, focusing on
emergency programmes to help groups requiring
additional support.
Across countries at all income levels, including
some of those that were comparati vel y
ill prepared, the crisis led to innovative and
sometimes bold policy actions, and contributed
to a clearer understanding of the synergies and
complementarities both within social protection
systems – their contributory and non-contributory
elements – and between the social protection
system and labour market policies. For example,
the extension of social protection to informal
economy workers represents a breakthrough that
offers a triple dividend: providing workers with
economic security and peace of mind; facilitating
access to complementary measures such as
active labour market policies (ALMPs) and public

3. Social protection during the COVID‑19 crisis and recovery

employment programmes ; and supporting higher
productivity and facilitating transitions to the
formal economy, contributing in the longer term
to a more sustainable and equitable financing
of social protection (ILO 2021g, 2020f; ILO and
FAO 2021).
In some countries, social protection has
been insensitive to the needs of women,
children, indigenous people and people with
disabilities. According to the UN Development
Programme and UN Women, the global jobs and
social protection response to the crisis has been
largely gender-blind: of 1,340 social protection
measures they identified, only 23 per cent can
be considered gender-sensitive (half aimed at
strengthening women’s economic security and
half at supporting unpaid care work) (UNDP and
UN Women 2021). Moreover, about one third of
all high-income countries did not implement any
policies specifically aimed at supporting children
through the crisis period, and only 2 per cent
of the fiscal response across all high-income
countries was earmarked for child-specific social
protection policies. By contrast, around 90 per
cent of the fiscal response was allocated to or
through businesses (in such forms as loans and
grants, or wage subsidies), tending to benefit
families with a strong labour market attachment.
However, marginalized families tend not to enjoy
such attachment and therefore such measures
serve their children poorly (Richardson, Carraro,
et al. 2020). Similarly, indigenous people were not
well served (De Schutter 2020), and only 60 of the
181 countries that implemented relief measures
made specific reference to people with disabilities
in doing so (UNPRPD and ILO 2021).
Many social protection responses have been
“maladapted, short-term, reactive, and
inattentive to the realities of people in poverty”
(De Schutter 2020, 2). Despite the unprecedented
scale of the global social protection response to the
COVID‑19 crisis, many of the measures introduced
were only temporary (typically paid for three
months) and benefit levels were often insufficient;
such measures were therefore limited in their
ability to protect people’s incomes and health in a
protracted crisis such as the COVID‑19 pandemic.
Some measures, moreover, have adverse longerterm implications. For instance, in some countries
individuals were permitted to withdraw a portion
of their funds from mandatory individual savings
accounts, potentially compromising future old-age
income security (ILO 2021m). In addition, the ad
hoc implementation of benefits has left many
groups – especially informal economy workers,

73

migrants and indigenous people – unprotected,
or has been insufficiently sensitive to their specific
circumstances (see above). In some cases, social
protection responses magnified the challenges
in accessing benefits faced by those who were
already difficult to reach, such as those without
access to digital technologies. Without continued
support for social protection expenditure and
prolongation of emergency measures, many
countries face the possibility of the “cliff fall”
scenario mentioned above.

compliance with human

insufficient (De Schutter 2020). In countries with
well-established social dialogue structures in
place before the crisis, national social protection
strategy and emergency response plans have
tended to be informed by effective social dialogue
taking place through these structures, as in the
cases of Denmark (ILO 2021o) and Mozambique
(de Lima Vieira, Vicente Andrés, and Monteiro
2020). Insufficient social dialogue reduces
collective buy-in and consensus around social
protection and undermines its sustainability. That
only limited social dialogue took place in many
countries, promoted by social partners, perhaps
indicates that this principle is not yet widely
enough recognized or deeply enough internalized.
Social dialogue is not just a nice gesture or a
policy add-on to be used when convenient; it is
an essential part of developing well-designed
solutions that cater to the needs of all members
of society.
The crisis has highlighted the need to build
inclusive delivery systems. Many countries
were hard pressed to identify those in urgent
need of additional protection against the health
and economic risks facing them – once again,
especially informal economy workers – and to
disburse benefits to them rapidly and safely. In
many countries, digital technologies were crucial
to the identification of beneficiaries and delivery of
benefits, and were used in creative and innovative

74

X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

ways. However, digital technologies also carry
exclusion risks: where people do not have access
to banks and financial services, lack digital literacy
and/or do not have access to smartphones, they
may end up doubly excluded.
Even when the immediate health crisis begins
to wane, the legacy of COVID‑19 in terms of its
social, psychological, economic and political
consequences will not instantaneously
evaporate. Evidence is already accumulating of
profound repercussions, including adverse social
and economic effects, that will long outlast the
pandemic itself. For those deprived of education,
employment and human contact, and those
whose physical and mental well-being have been
damaged or permanently changed, its deleterious
impact will endure. Social scarring of the kind
observed in the aftermath of previous crises will
characterize the world after this crisis too.
There will also be long-term consequences for
public finances. The loss of contributory and tax
revenues represents a challenge for all social
protection schemes, given the increased demand
for benefits and the commensurate increase
in expenditure. This threat to the financial
resilience of contributory and non-contributory
schemes alike makes the challenge confronting
low-income countries in particular even more
daunting. Taking into account the impact of
the crisis, low-income countries would have
needed to invest additional sums amounting to
about 16 per cent of their average GDP to meet
the annual financing level required to close
coverage gaps in 2020 alone (Durán Valverde
et al. 2020). Even though resource mobilization
efforts during COVID‑19 have exceeded by far
the stimulus packages introduced in the wake of

X

the 2008 financial crisis (Almenfi
et al. 2020), they have been
largely concentrated in highincome countries (ILO 2020b,
2020f). These figures are even
more troubling because the
cumulative effects of fiscal policy
are expected to be greater in the
long term, potentially widening
existing disparities between
countries (ILO 2020k).

We are only
as safe as the
most vulnerable
among us, and
nowhere is safe
until and unless
everywhere
is safe.

Never theless, there may be
enduringly positive aspects to
the legacy of the crisis too, especially in terms
of reconfigured mindsets: governments may no
longer be timorous and indecisive at the onset
of a public health crisis, but instead take rapid
action to contain it. Moreover, COVID‑19 has
underscored the inescapability of our intimate
codependence: the fact that we are only as safe
as the most vulnerable among us, and nowhere
is safe until and unless everywhere is safe. The
interconnectedness of our economies and
societies has never been more clearly manifest
than in the rapid spread of health, social and
economic consequences that do not stop at
country borders.

This crisis has shown that, when prompted into
action, States are not without choices, and that
they have both the potential and the requisite
instruments to combat major challenges. However,
many were woefully unprepared, and too little
progress has been made in realizing the right to
social security, despite bold commitments. Many
countries now find themselves at a crossroads
with regard to the future orientation of their
national social protection strategies and systems.

3.3 Social protection at the crossroads

Many countries
now stand at
a crossroads,
facing a choice
over the future
of their social
protection
strategy.

While the COVID‑19 crisis provoked
an unparalleled social protection
response, many countries now
stand at a crossroads, facing a
choice over the future of their
social protection strategy.
Both the ILO Centenar y
Declaration for the Future of Work
(2019) and Recommendation
No. 202 signpost a high-road
social protection strategy for all
countries very clearly. Choosing

this path now means taking decisive policy
action to close those coverage and adequacy
gaps that became apparent during the crisis,
and to strengthen social protection worldwide
to ensure that everyone can enjoy this right. This
requires universal, comprehensive, adequate and
sustainable social protection systems that are in
line with human rights principles and international
social security standards. Taking this high road
will support a human-centred recovery and help
ensure a future of decent work, human rights and
social justice for all.

3. Social protection during the COVID‑19 crisis and recovery

3.3.1 A high-road scenario:
Towards strengthened
social protection systems,
including floors
Historically, some crises have prompted the
progressive reconfiguration of existing social
arrangements in previously unimagined ways.
Examples include Roosevelt’s “New Deal” after
the 1930s Great Depression, which introduced
the provision of large-scale social security in the
United States; the Beveridge Report of 1942 in
the United Kingdom; the expansion of European
welfare states after the Second World War; and
the investment in social protection in East Asia
after the 1997 financial crisis (Woo-Cumings
2007). Arguably, the present crisis has assumed
such vast dimensions that it has reconfigured
policy mindsets and prised open a unique window
of opportunity.
A social and “generative” state is resurgent.
The stress test applied by COVID‑19 has shown
that states are not powerless to act in the
interest of all their citizens in the face of immense
challenges and has massively expanded the scope
of policy action that can be taken (Giddens 1994;
Mazzucato 2013, 2021). The crisis has underscored
the primacy and legitimacy of the state as bearing

the chief responsibility and duty to protect its
citizens, and the potential for states to become
“generative”, that is, oriented to fully realizing
human capabilities (Giddens 1994). Only the state
can act decisively to protect health, income and
jobs on the scale that has been required, and to
ensure macroeconomic and social stability. Many
countries have put themselves on a quasi-war
footing – but this time to preserve life – and
declared a readiness to do “whatever it takes”
(G7 2020). For instance, Japan committed an
unprecedented 42 per cent of GDP to fiscal stimuli
(Almenfi et al. 2020). Moreover, some States have
acted with determination to assert their authority
over practices that were considered not to be in the
public interest, reaffirming norms underpinning
the social contract. For example, Denmark barred
companies operating in tax havens from access
to employment retention benefits (Australia
Institute, Nordic Policy Centre 2020).
The crisis has fuelled a drive for more
universalistic and inclusive approaches to
social protection. Experience of previous crises
and of non-crisis times indicates that poverty and
inequality are far better addressed in countries
that provide universal social protection than in
those where patchy social safety-net approaches
prevail (see box 3.1). There have been examples
of a drive towards more universalistic provision,
as seen in the modest temporary extension of

X Box 3.1 Poverty and inequality during COVID‑19 and beyond
COVID‑19 and the economic recession it induced could jeopardize years of sustained – though uneven and
slowing – progress in poverty reduction. The World Bank (2020) estimates that an additional 100 million
people are likely to be pushed into extreme poverty (defined as living on less than US$1.9 per day), with
heightened poverty risks for urban dwellers and those with higher levels of education, changing the
profile of poverty. These developments further threaten progress towards achieving the SDGs, coming
as they do on top of an earlier increase in poverty in countries affected by armed conflict and climate
change; for example, in the Middle East and North Africa the number of people living in extreme poverty
had already doubled between 2015 and 2018. Estimates suggest that, unless there is a major “Sustainable
Development Goals push”, in a high-damage scenario up to 250 million additional people will be living in
extreme poverty in 2030, bringing the total number of the extremely poor to 1 billion (UNDP and Pardee
Center 2020).
These figures attest to the fragility of the progress that has been achieved and the limited capacity of
economic growth alone to reduce poverty. They also poignantly remind us that rising above a daily
income of less than US$1.9 per day is hardly an indicator of having achieved even a minimally adequate
standard of living (UN 2020f), let alone any leeway to cope with unexpected expenses or life shocks. Social
protection has a well-documented capacity to reduce inequality and prevent poverty (see section 1.1),
cushion the effects of socio-economic crises and act as an economic stabilizer. Initial evidence from the
current crisis shows that the expansion of social assistance programmes in the Latin American region
had a cushioning effect and limited more extreme increases in poverty and inequality (ECLAC 2020b;
Lustig et al. 2020).

provision in some countries, such as Cabo Verde
and Uzbekistan (ILO 2020w). Furthermore, those
countries that actively extended provision to reach
hitherto uncovered groups of the population,
including through digital technology, and
included them in national registries, established
a basis that could enable further extension of
social protection.
There are tentative indications that the crisis
may have reinforced a discursive shift, already
under way before the crisis, towards universal
approaches to social protection. Emblematic of
this shift is the World Bank’s engagement in the
Global Partnership for Universal Social Protection
to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals
(USP2030 2019) since 2016, its growing interest
in universal basic income (see below) (Gentilini,
Grosh, et al. 2020), and the IMF’s guidance on
safeguarding social spending (IMF 2019). In the
context of COVID‑19, the World Bank has spoken
of the merits of “universal entitlements to health
care and income support” and the need to reach
the “missing middle” (Rutkowski 2020). The IMF
has recognized the logic of universal responses,
at least in the short term (IMF 2020c). The extent to
which the shift in rhetoric will have any bearing on
IFI operations on the ground remains to be seen,
however. For the time being, country-level policy

advice accompanying loans offered to borrowing
countries appears to continue to promote a
limited safety-net approach, a weakening of
social insurance and labour deregulation that
may lead to premature fiscal adjustment (Ortiz
and Cummins 2021).
There has been a renewed and prominent
public debate about categorical and universal
benefits, including a UBI. The sharp increase in
child poverty resulting from the pandemic has
prompted a lively policy debate about the potential
of universal child benefits as a temporary or
permanent element of social protection systems
(see section 4.1), running alongside a more longstanding debate on universal pensions. Moreover,
there has been growing interest in a temporary
UBI as an emergency stability measure during
the crisis (Cooke, Orton, and de Wispelaere 2020),
although some “UBI” proposals have suggested
only targeted transfers with moderate to high
coverage (Gray Molina and Ortiz-Juarez 2020).
Similarly, ECLAC has proposed an emergency basic
income, suggesting that countries could gradually
build on this to realize a full UBI (2020a, 2020b,
2021). There is, however, uncertainty about the
potential contribution of a UBI to building longterm comprehensive social protection systems
(see box 3.2).

X Box 3.2 What might be the role of a UBI in a high-road strategy?
UBI proposals are guided by different motivations, ranging from interest in the mechanism’s
emancipatory potential – expanding choices, resourcing meaningful autonomy and facilitating a “multiactivity life” (Gorz 1999) – to concerns about cost savings or reducing the size of the state. In a context
of fiscal belt-tightening, there are concerns that UBIs might replace contributory social security systems
that offer higher levels of protection, and that they could undermine workers’ rights (ITUC 2018) and
crowd out public investment in essential services (Alston 2018).
While some versions of a UBI could potentially provide all the income security guarantees of a social
protection floor, its impact on poverty and inequality largely depends on its design, including the level
of benefits, how it is financed, and how it relates to existing tax and social security systems. A modest
UBI benefit may risk spreading resources too thinly across the population. On the other hand, there are
concerns about the significant financing requirements of a UBI that is set at an adequate level.
Universal social protection does not necessarily require that everyone receive an equal benefit at every
point in time, as would be the case with a UBI (Ortiz et al. 2018); rather, it guarantees that all people
receive an adequate benefit if and when it is needed. Whether a UBI could contribute to a high-road
approach, involving the construction of rights-based and sustainable social protection systems, decent
work and social justice, depends on a range of factors. The principles embodied in ILO Recommendation
No. 202 provide a useful tool with which to evaluate the potential of a UBI for contributing to a social
protection floor (Ortiz et al. 2018).

3. Social protection during the COVID‑19 crisis and recovery

There has been increased public support for
social protection. In some countries, social
protection has been the target of a decadeslong media and political offensive, casting it as
wasteful and costly rather than an investment,
and a provision to be reserved only for the “poor”.
The current crisis may have helped citizens to
better understand the value of social protection,
their rights and obligations in this respect, and
the merits of a social investment welfare state
(Morel, Palier, and Palme 2012). Many working-age
people may have had their first recourse to social
protection during this crisis, thereby furthering
appreciation of its value. Also perceptible is
a revalorization of redistribution and social
contracts more generally (Zamore and Phillips
2020) as a way to maintain living standards.
Everyone can understand that social protection
reduces the trade-offs people would otherwise
have to make between income and health, and
how this protects public health. It is not surprising
that in some countries people’s trust in public
institutions has increased, strengthening the
social contract (O’Donoghue, Sologon, and
Kyzyma 2021).
The macroeconomic policy orthodoxy has
been called into question. The seismic impact
of COVID‑19 has punctured prevailing economic
reasoning and challenged the arbitrary normative
“limits” that have hitherto constrained economic
thinking. It has demonstrated that economic
systems can take far more strain than was thought,
and can be steered in directions that serve social
needs and protect public health. Deficit spending
has been prioritized in many OECD countries
and prohibitions on fiscal expansionism as a
countercyclical measure have receded. This
sharply distinguishes the fiscal response to
COVID‑19 from the response to the 2008 financial
crisis (Almenfi et al. 2020). The IMF’s proposal of a
temporary pandemic solidarity tax to redistribute
the gains of those who have prospered is perhaps
further indication of a paradigm shift towards a
more redistributive approach (Giles 2021).
Countries can choose the kind of social
protection system they want to pursue.
COVID‑19 has propelled social protection towards
an important juncture where each country can
decide on the nature of the social protection
system it wants. All countries, regardless of their
income level, have the choice – albeit with differing
degrees of freedom in practice – to pursue a
high-road or a low-road strategy. The massive
2021 policy action in the United States, which
embodies many of the hallmarks of a high-road

strategy, shows that countries can pivot and take
a very different direction to that taken in the past.
Others, meanwhile, are reversing recklessly down
a low road with a disregard for both their citizens’
well-being and the risk to global public health
(Médecins Sans Frontières 2021).
Making progress in a high-road scenario means
making continued investment in social protection
to ensure a human-centred response to this
ongoing crisis and to an eventual recovery. Beyond
crisis mitigation, a high-road approach will involve
a longer-term commitment to progressively
strengthening social protection systems, including
floors, as reflected in Recommendation No. 202
and the vision set out in the Centenary Declaration
(ILO 2019e). Such policies are essential to
accelerate progress towards achieving the SDGs.
The policy window for embarking on a highroad strategy will not remain open indefinitely.
Governments must seize upon the momentum
created by the current crisis to make rapid progress
towards universal social protection systems and at
the same time to prepare themselves for present
and future challenges.

3.3.2 A low-road scenario:
Minimalist safety nets
and stopgap measures
Evidence of a low-road turn is visible in some of
the immediate social protection responses to the
crisis and in failures to translate calls for solidarity
at the global level into concrete action.
The first contractions of social spending,
including social protection measures, are
already under way. Analysis indicates that budget
cuts are expected in 154 countries in 2021, and
as many as 159 countries in 2022, which would
mean that in the latter year 6.6 billion people or
85 per cent of the global population will be living
under austerity conditions (Ortiz and Cummins
2021). This trend resonates with the experience
of previous crises, where the first signs of
recovery prompted calls for fiscal consolidation
and sometimes austerity (Ortiz et al. 2015). For
contributory systems, several potential risks arise:
that waived social security contributions are not
recovered, that social security reserves are used
without replenishment, and/or that the billions
spent on fiscal responses will be passed on to
social security administrations as debt. Moreover,

77

78

X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

how this debt is paid back, and by whom, will have
significant implications for social equity. Calls
for austerity threaten to reduce the resources
devoted to social protection, undermining its role
of reducing inequality and poverty.
Yawning “stimulus gaps” have opened up
and calls for global solidarity are not being
translated into concrete action. There has
been an inequitable stimulus response to
COVID‑19 – characterized as the “stimulus gap”
(ILO 2020k) – whereby lower-middle-income
countries have been able to muster fiscal stimulus
measures to the value of only 1 per cent of those
mobilized by high-income countries. Current
financial pledges and actual commitments to lowincome countries are woefully inadequate. While
IFIs and development partners have announced
various financial packages to help low-income
and lower-middle-income countries tackle the
socio-economic fallout of the crisis, amounting to
US$1.3 trillion as of 1 February 2021, only a small
share (US$166.8 billion) of that total has been
effectively approved and allocated to support
countries in the areas of social protection and
health (ILO, forthcoming b).
Massive fiscal stimuli have not been used to
unleash progressive and necessary elements
of a high-road transition, such as a green
recovery. While there are examples of fiscal
stimuli being used to facilitate prosocial goals,
these remain the exceptions. According to an
analysis of G20 fiscal stimulus spending, just
12 per cent of the total figure of US$14.9 trillion
allocated can be considered green, for example
by being devoted to low-carbon projects (Vivid
Economics and Finance for Biodiversity 2021).
Green spending can generate job growth in the
real economy as well as improving public health
while also mitigating climate change; but rescue
packages have mainly focused on preserving
liquidity, solvency and livelihoods (Hepburn et al.
2020; ILO 2020e).
Is there one fiscal rule for rich countries,
another for developing countries? As noted in
the previous section, IFIs and central banks have
encouraged higher-income countries to spend
and pursue expansionary fiscal measures to
avoid economic contraction. But IFIs have been
less supportive of expansionary measures for
developing countries (IMF 2020d; Georgieva 2020).
The advice they have given compounds concerns
about the insufficient availability of financial
support for lower-income countries – especially
those lacking strong international currencies – a
lack of action over debt cancellation and the

deadlock on the issuance
of special drawing rights
Austerity will be

2020). While all countries

road, these factors constrict
the choices available to many
developing countries. Constrained by the approach
of IFIs, hostile international financial actors, credit
rating agencies, limited fiscal space and decades
of ideological attacks on “deficit” spending,
developing countries face challenges both in
introducing more significant stimulus measures
and, beyond the crisis, in sustaining urgently
needed investment in building and maintaining
social protection floors. Another round of austerity
will generate long-term social scarring and will
be incompatible with a human-centred recovery.
At the same time, actions at the international
level that could enhance domestic resource
mobilization, such as shutting down tax havens,
more effectively taxing multinational corporations
through a unitary tax system, or turning the tide of
illicit financial flows, are still limited in scope.
Divergent recovery scenarios threaten to
further polarize an already unequal world.
The IMF has warned about the challenges of a
divergent recovery, whereby richer countries
rebound and recover quickly while lower-income
nations lose their recent development gains, such
as progress in poverty reduction (IMF 2021b).
Vital to ensuring a human-centred recovery
everywhere is equitable access to vaccines.
While global scientific collaboration on COVID‑19
vaccine development has been remarkable and
holds great promise as part of efforts to bring
the pandemic under control, it has not been
matched by effective political coordination on
the distribution of the vaccines themselves. To
date, the COVAX facility has disbursed 39 million
COVID‑19 vaccines to 114 participating lowermiddle-income and low-income countries (Gavi
2021). However, inequitable access to vaccines
risks driving another wedge between developed
and developing countries. While joint initiatives
such as COVAX are much-needed examples of
solidarity, early signs of vaccine cooperation
are mixed, and the emergence of vaccination
nationalism, whereby richer nations compete with
and clamber over one another to secure access to
and hoard vaccines, is cause for concern. Avoiding
this, and ensuring equitable access to vaccines,
comprises a double imperative of moral propriety
and economic logic (Adhanom Ghebreyesus 2021;
IMF 2021a).

3. Social protection during the COVID‑19 crisis and recovery

All countries have a choice on whether to pursue
a low-road or a high-road strategy, although the
pressures on some countries to acquiesce in a
low-road strategy may be immense. Pursuing
the low-road option would be damaging and, in
the context of COVID‑19, represents a wasted
policy window for strengthening social protection
systems. In some countries, this route implies
the continuation of half-measures or a “cliff-fall”
scenario, perpetuating large coverage gaps, and
limited adequacy and comprehensiveness of
provision. Social protection would be limited to
“safety-net” programmes, often with complex
eligibility requirements, resulting in exclusion
and stigmatization of potential recipients. Another
facet of the low road would be exclusionary social
insurance poorly adapted to workers in diverse
forms of employment, with their different
contribution histories and needs. Furthermore,
if entitlements are not established in national
legislation, individuals have only limited ability
to hold the state accountable. In such a context,

X

the better-off will be able to pursue privatized
provision, at the expense of nourishing social
solidarity and social cohesion. Over the longer
term, pursuit of a low-road approach risks setting
in motion a downward cascade of negative
development outcomes that are neither rational
nor desirable, and are not in line with human
rights obligations.

3.3.3 From collateral social
and economic damage to a highroad social protection strategy
If there is a silver lining to this pandemic, it is the
potent reminder it has provided of the critical
importance of social protection and the need to
follow a high-road strategy (figure 3.4). It is evident
that countries can pursue a high-road strategy
in different ways – there is no “one pre-eminent

high road”. This pluralism and pragmatic realism
is reflected in Recommendation No. 202, which
provides guidance to countries that are embarking
on this trajectory, and stresses that there are
different means by which to reach the objective
of universal social protection progressively,
using different types of benefits and financing
mechanisms. Nevertheless, to make progress
along a high road requires several policy actions
to be taken and several critical challenges to be
tackled. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 5,
but may be summarized here as follows:
X ensuring universal protection for all people in

case of need;

X overcoming serious structural challenges that

predated COVID‑19, but were accentuated by it;

X ensuring that the state effectively fulfils its role

by enshrining social protection in law and being
answerable to rights-holders;

X ensuring that social, economic and employment

policies cohere;

X leveraging the comparative advantages of

universal social protection – rights fulfilment,
inclusivity, ease of take-up, non-stigmatizing
shock responsiveness – across both contributory
and non-contributory provision;

X closing social protection financing gaps in

sustainable and equitable ways by considering
a diversity of mechanisms based on national
and international solidarity as a matter of
priority – both during this crisis and beyond it;

X making full use of social dialogue and social

participation;

X further enhancing coordination between

United Nations agencies, development
partners and IFIs on the design and financing
of social protection.

COVID‑19 has been a prelude to bigger challenges
ahead. Given the immense social and economic
collateral damage wrought by the pandemic, now
is the time for being bold and taking the high road
to realize universal social protection and shape a
more socially just future.

4.1 Social protection for children
and families

X Social protection systems are an essential mechanism for

realizing children’s rights. They play a critical role in improving
children’s development and well-being, helping all children attain
their full potential and supporting family livelihoods and care
needs. In doing so, they break vicious cycles of poverty and socioeconomic vulnerability. Conversely, experiences of childhood
poverty can last a lifetime, and the effects of deprivations such
as malnutrition and poor education can be intergenerational.
In consequence, the need to close gaps in social protection
coverage, comprehensiveness and adequacy and to address
child poverty is of overriding urgency.

X The impacts of poverty on children are devastating, and yet

children are twice as likely to live in poverty as adults. While
modest progress was made before COVID‑19 to the point where,
in 2017, 17.5 per cent of children – one in six, or 356 million – were
living in extreme poverty (down from an estimated 19.5 per cent
in 2013), the pandemic has dealt a profound blow to child wellbeing. On the basis of national poverty lines, it is estimated that
the pandemic has increased the number of children living in
income-poor households by more than 142 million, bringing the
total to almost 725 million.

X The vast majority of children still have no effective social protection

coverage. Effective coverage figures for SDG indicator 1.3.1 show
that only 26.4 per cent of children globally receive social protection
benefits, with significant regional disparities: while 82.3 per cent
of children in Europe and Central Asia and 57.4 per cent in the
Americas receive benefits, this is the case for only 18 per cent of
children in Asia and the Pacific, 15.4 per cent in the Arab States
and 12.6 per cent in Africa.

X Positive recent developments (both before and during the

pandemic) include the adoption of universal or quasi-universal
child benefits in several countries; COVID‑19 has renewed
awareness of the critical importance of inclusive social
protection systems and high-quality childcare services, and
of the need for social protection for caregivers, be they care
workers delivering services or unpaid care providers in families.

key messages

X

X Data on social protection expenditure

for children in 133 countries show
that, on average, 1.1 per cent of GDP
is spent on child benefits. Again,
there are large regional disparities,
the proportion ranging from 0.1 per
cent in low-income countries to
1.2 per cent in high-income countries.

X While the crisis response to

COVID‑19 was unprecedented, with
fiscal stimuli adopted globally, it
was insufficiently child-sensitive.
This deficiency, combined with the
risk of a return to austerity, puts
recent progress in social protection
systems for children in jeopardy.
Austerity policies are harmful for
children. It is critically important that
post-COVID‑19 fiscal adjustments
do not undermine the progress
made in child and family policies,
or accentuate existing inequalities,
and that recovery is used as a policy
opportunity to further strengthen
child-sensitive and inclusive systems.

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

4.1.1 The role of social
protection in addressing
poverty and socio-economic
vulnerabilities for children
The Member States of the UN have committed
themselves to ending extreme child poverty, and
halving child poverty as measured by nationally
defined poverty lines, by 2030. Furthermore,
under SDG target 1.3, Member States explicitly
committed themselves to increasing social
protection coverage, including for children.
The ambition expressed by Goal 1 of the
SDGs recognizes the role of social protection
in addressing child poverty and vulnerability.
However, COVID‑19 has dealt a severe blow to the
prospects of achieving these goals.

X

COVID‑19 is likely to reverse
progress made in child poverty
reduction

Through illness, job loss and disrupted access to
school and key services for children’s well-being,
rights and development, COVID‑19 is expected to
reverse the modest progress made in reducing
child poverty, as last measured in 2017, in all parts
of the world. Based on national poverty lines in lowand middle-income settings, it is estimated that,
during 2020, the pandemic increased the number
of children living in income-poor households by
over 142 million, to around 725 million in total
(UNICEF and Save the Children 2020a). Even highincome countries, on average, can expect their
child income poverty rates to increase as a result
of the economic consequences of the lockdowns,
and to stay above pre-COVID‑19 rates for up to five
years (Richardson, Carraro, et al. 2020).
Crucially, the pandemic has brought into focus
the multiple deprivations children may face.
Pandemic-related closures of schools and childcare
services, and overburdened health systems, have
left whole child populations without key school,
health and sanitation services necessary for their
development and well-being. Before COVID‑19,
1 billion or 45 per cent of children in developing
countries were deprived of at least one key service.
It is estimated that the effects of COVID‑19 have
pushed 150 million more children – an increase
of 9 percentage points – into multidimensional
poverty (UNICEF and Save the Children 2020b).
Analysis in the first months of the pandemic
estimated that almost 7 million more children

under the age of 5 were at risk of malnutrition,
translating into an estimated increase in avoidable
deaths of approximately 10,000 per month
(UNICEF 2020d). Compared to the 2019 figure,
this represents an increase of 1.8 million avoidable
deaths of children under the age of 5 attributable
to malnutrition (WHO 2020a).

X

Prior to COVID‑19, one in six
children lived in extreme poverty

Before COVID‑19, children were more than
twice as likely as adults to be living in extreme
poverty. Comparative figures from the World
Bank and UNICEF (Silwal et al. 2020) estimated
that, in 2017, 17.5 per cent of children globally
lived in households with a per capita income of
less than US$1.90 PPP, compared to just 7.9 per
cent of adults aged 18 and above. In real terms,
this means that one in six children – 356 million
in total – were living in extreme poverty. Although
this is an improvement on the situation in
2013 – when an estimated 19.5 per cent of children
and 9.2 per cent of adults were living in extreme
poverty – the 2017 figures remain a long way off
the global goal of extreme poverty eradication.
Geographically, Africa alone is home to almost
two thirds (65.6 per cent) of the world’s extremely
poor children. And, in stark contrast to the global
trend, in sub-Saharan Africa extreme child poverty
is estimated to have increased from 170 million
in 2013 to 234 million in 2017 (Silwal et al. 2020).
Based on demographic and growth projections, it
is estimated that, by 2030, nine out of ten children
experiencing extreme poverty will live in subSaharan Africa (UNICEF and World Bank 2016).
Of especially serious concern are fragile States,
where social protection coverage is very low and
41.6 per cent of children live in extreme poverty,
compared to 14.8 per cent in non-fragile States
(Silwal et al. 2020).
Comprehensive social protection is a tool for
poverty reduction and prevention, and so a
focus on those at risk of extreme poverty – living
just above the US$1.90 PPP threshold – is
also necessar y, given that approximately
1.35 billion – 66.7 per cent, or two in every three
children globally – live in households below the
US$5.50 PPP poverty line (Silwal et al. 2020).
The richest countries also experience child
income poverty. Recent analysis of 41 highincome countries shows that no country has
reported child income poverty rates below
10 per cent (Richardson, Carraro, et al. 2020).

85

86

X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

Moreover, since the global financial and economic
crisis of 2007– 08, child pover t y has been
increasing or stagnating in a majority of highincome countries (Richardson, Carraro, et al.
2020), owing to the mutually reinforcing effects
of low employment rates and austerity cuts
(Richardson, Carraro, et al. 2020; Cantillon et al.
2017; ILO 2014b; Ortiz and Cummins 2012).

to be living in poverty is not only a moral concern,
given the devastating impacts on their current
well-being and long-term development, it also
has adverse implications for societies in general.
This twin imperative underscores the urgency

of extending child-sensitive social protection to
reduce poverty. COVID‑19 merely adds to this
urgency. The pandemic, and the limited provision
of child-specific social protection responses
(section 3.2.2), calls for a redoubling of efforts
to prioritize child rights and well-being globally.
Social protection policies are powerful tools in

being globally.

X Box 4.1 Social protection is critical for combating child labour
Child labour remains unacceptably common in the world today. At the start of 2020, 160 million
children – 63 million girls and 97 million boys – were engaged in child labour, or one in ten children
worldwide. Recent history provides cause for concern. In the past four years, for the first time since
2000, the world did not make progress in reducing child labour: during that period, the absolute number
of children in child labour increased by over 8 million, while the proportion of children in child labour
remained unchanged owing to population growth. There were marked regional differences, with child
labour continuing to drop in the Americas and in Asia and the Pacific, while in Africa it rose by 20 million
and prevalence increased by 2 percentage points. Most child labour is unpaid family work, and 70 per
cent of it is in agriculture (ILO and UNICEF 2021).
The devastating full-spectrum effects of COVID‑19 may push millions more children into child labour,
reversing some of the earlier gains (ILO and UNICEF 2020). Evidence is mounting that child labour is
increasing as livelihoods are lost and the education of more than 1.5 billion children has been interrupted
(UNESCO 2020a). Even when classes fully restart, parents may no longer be able to afford to send their
children to school, and more children may be forced into hazardous work. Gender inequalities may
worsen, with girls particularly vulnerable to exploitation in agriculture and domestic work (ILO and
UNICEF 2020). Some 11 million girls may not return to school (UNESCO 2020b).
To prevent and eradicate child labour, expanding social protection to cover all children is vital. Social
protection can improve the income-generating capacities of parents and enable them to engage in
higher-risk, higher-return activities. By providing a steady, predictable source of income, social protection
enables households to avoid harmful coping strategies in the face of economic shocks, such as pulling
children out of school, cutting spending on food or selling productive assets (ILO 2013; Bastagli et al.
2016; de Hoop and Rosati 2014).
However, child labour is determined by a complex set of factors, including insufficient access to goodquality education, limited household awareness of the consequences of hazardous work and weakly
enforced legislation. Therefore, reducing child labour requires cash support to be integrated within a
broader set of interventions, including improved access to good-quality education and child protection
services. Moreover, it is important that the impacts of social protection programmes on child labour are
closely monitored, in order to ensure that the programmes’ design features, such as transfer amounts
and eligibility criteria, are adequate to achieve a reduction in child labour (ODI and UNICEF 2020).

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

X Box 4.2 International standards for child and family benefits
The UN legal framework on human rights contains a number of provisions spelling out the various rights
of children that form part of their right to social protection. These include the right to social security, taking
into consideration the resources and the circumstances of the child and people having responsibility
for their maintenance;1 the right to a standard of living adequate for their health and their well-being;
and the right to special care and assistance.2 Moreover, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
(CRC) stipulates that “States Parties shall recognize for every child the right to benefit from social security,
including social insurance, and shall take the necessary measures to achieve the full realization of this
right in accordance with their national law” (Article 26). The International Covenant on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) further requires States to give the widest possible protection and assistance
to the family, particularly in respect of the care and education of dependent children (Article 10(1)).
International social security standards complement this framework. ILO Convention No. 102 (Part VII)
sets minimum standards for the provision of family (or child) benefits in the form of a periodic cash
benefit, benefits in kind (food, clothing, housing, holidays or domestic help) or a combination of both.
ILO Recommendation No. 202 emphasizes the universality of protection, stating that the basic social
security guarantee should apply at a minimum to all residents, and all children, as defined in national
laws and regulations and subject to existing international obligations (Para. 6), that is, to the respective
provisions of the CRC, the ICESCR and other relevant instruments. Representing an approach strongly
focused on outcomes, Recommendation No. 202 allows for a broad range of policy instruments to
achieve income security for children, including child and family benefits as part of a broader portfolio
of interventions.

Rights, 1966, Art. 9; UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989, Art. 26. 2 Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
Art. 25(1) and (2).

In order to maximize the impact on children
during the pandemic, in recovery and beyond,
all social protection interventions should respect
the principles anchored in the Joint Statement
on Advancing Child-Sensitive Social Protection,
issued in 2009 by a coalition of UN agencies,
bilateral donor agencies and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) (see box 4.3).

Ensuring children’s rights to social security and to
an adequate standard of living, health, education
and care, and achieving the 2030 Agenda, will
not be possible without a conducive policy
framework that prioritizes children’s needs and
requirements. International standards for child
and family benefits (see box 4.2) are a significant
component of this policy framework. A childsensitive and rights-based approach to social
protection, informed by social security standards,
can support policymakers in formulating policies
that serve children’s needs and rights and do no
harm to the situation of families with children.

X Box 4.3 Child-sensitive social protection in COVID‑19 responses
The Joint Statement on Advancing Child-Sensitive Social Protection (DfID et al. 2009) sets out seven
principles as a basis for achieving child-sensitive social protection: namely, that it should avoid adverse
impacts on children and reduce or mitigate social and economic risks that affect them; intervene as early
as possible where children are at risk; consider the age- and gender-specific risks and vulnerabilities
of children throughout the life cycle; mitigate the effects of shocks, exclusion and poverty on families;
make special provision to reach children who are particularly vulnerable and excluded; consider intrahousehold dynamics affecting children; and allow for the participation of children and caregivers in the
understanding and design of social protection systems and programmes.
Despite widespread evidence supporting the effectiveness of child-sensitive social protection in response
to crises (Tirivayi et al. 2020), government COVID‑19 stimuli in high-income countries to date have focused
on straight-to-business support, for example in the form of loans and grants. Social protection measures
specifically directed to families for raising children made up only around 2 per cent of these countries’
overall response expenditure. This “trickle-down” approach has tended to reach only families in the
formal labour market, rather than more vulnerable families and children, thereby further accentuating
the marginalization of the latter (Richardson, Carraro, et al. 2020).
For these reasons, many COVID‑19 responses have failed to meet the indivisible principles of the Joint
Statement. Given this, and the looming risk of austerity and a debt crisis (Ortiz and Cummins 2021;
UNICEF 2021), there is clear potential for the further exacerbation of child poverty and inequality. This
prospect underlines the need for the global community to apply these principles better as they seek to
build stronger, child-sensitive, social protection systems during and beyond the pandemic.

4.1.2 Types of child and family
social protection schemes
It is essential for the achievement of the SDGs, in
particular SDG 1 on poverty and SDG 2 on hunger,
but also those on health and education (SDGs 3
and 4), SDG 8 (specifically, target 8.7 on child
labour) and SDG 10 on inequality, that social
protection schemes and programmes reach all
families with children. Most children live in family
settings and ultimately rely on their families
to guarantee their well-being.1 Accordingly,
family well-being is a crucial determinant of
child well-being, and the range of policies and
policy instruments available to achieve improved
income security and social protection for children
is very broad. Interventions designed specifically
to benefit children include:
X income security from birth to adulthood:

universal or targeted, conditional or un­
conditional, contributory or non-contributory/
tax-financed child or family cash benefits,
or tax rebates for families with children;

1

X social protection benefits for those caring

for infants or children with disabilities or
illness: benefits provided for mothers, fathers
and other caregivers, including during leave
of absence from employment in relation to
a dependent child (for example, parental
benefits such as maternity, paternity and other
childcare leave benefits in cases of children’s
illness or disability);

X access to relevant services during the pre-

school period: effective access to relevant
services such as healthcare and childcare;

X benefits/services preparing for school

and while of school age: school feeding,
vaccination or health programmes and other
in-kind transfers such as free school uniforms,
schoolbooks and after-school care;

X benefits/services when families are in

specific need: social protection benefits that
do not explicitly target children, such as social
pensions or unemployment benefits, can have
clear benefits for children if families are being
protected (UNICEF 2019b).

Children living out of family settings, including those living in an institutional setting, are often the most vulnerable.
While social protection measures can help support the realization of their rights, child protection measures, including
deinstitutionalization and community-based care, are also essential.

Child and family cash benefit programmes
constitute an important element of national social
protection systems and play an essential role in
ensuring income security for families. Figure 4.1
provides an overview of the legal coverage of
such programmes worldwide. This differs from
effective coverage, summarized in figure 4.2,
which attempts to give an estimate of actual social
protection provision received. The issue of which
children should be provided for is also covered
in multiple international agreements (see box 4.2
above). Both the CRC and the SDGs have set out
the principle of non-discrimination, meaning
that no child is excluded, and emphasize that
effective coverage should be universal regardless
of nationality. As for the duration of benefits, the
ILO’s Committee of Experts on the Application
of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR)
suggests these standards require that family
benefits be granted in respect of each child in
the family and to all children, for as long as the
child is receiving full-time education or vocational
training and is not in receipt of an adequate
income as determined by national legislation
(ILO 2011a).

Figure 4.1 shows the different types of periodic
child and family cash benefit programmes in
operation worldwide. Over one in three (67) of
the 181 countries or territories for which data
are available do not have any statutory child or
family benefits, although non-statutory, noncontributory, means-tested programmes may
still exist in these countries. Of the 114 countries
with statutory periodic child/family benefits,
31 have contributory social insurance child
and family benefit schemes, mainly for formal
workers. Forty-five countries have means-tested
non-contributory benefits that cover only a small
part of the population. Research has shown that
some of these means-tested benefits suffer from
large exclusion errors, thereby failing to cover
vulnerable families (Kidd, Gelders, and BaileyAthias 2017; ODI and UNICEF 2020).
Thirty-eight countries have reached, or are close
to, universal coverage in child and family benefits.
While universal coverage has important povertyreduction effects, its absolute advantage lies in its
“welfare optimization” role in ensuring children’s
rights (see box 4.6 below). Twenty-three countries
provide universal child benefits (UCBs), anchored

89

90

X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

in national legislation, providing regular cash
payments (monthly, quarterly or yearly) to all
families with children. They are paid on a regular
basis as a cash (or tax) transfer to the primary
caregiver for dependent children under 18 years
of age for ten consecutive years or longer, thereby
covering more than half of childhood. An optimum
UCB would cover each dependent child for 18 years,
or longer if he or she is in education or training.
A further 15 countries provide statutory child
benefits that share some of the characteristics of
UCBs but do not fulfil all of their criteria, and so may
be called “quasi-universal child benefits” (qUCBs).
They comprise three age-limited benefits which
are paid for a limited period of the life course (ages
0–2 years in Belarus, 0–7 years in the Republic of
Korea and 0–3 years in Ukraine, for example); eight
affluence-tested schemes, which meet most of the
UCB criteria and which cover the large majority of
households, including middle-class households,
but intentionally screen out very high-income
households; and four coordinated schemes (in
Belgium, Japan, Liechtenstein and Switzerland),
which combine social insurance and tax-financed
targeted/means-tested schemes to address
coverage gaps and achieve universal or close to
universal coverage.
This section focuses on programmes anchored
in national legislation, as these are usually more
stable in terms of funding and institutional
frameworks, guarantee coverage as a matter of
right, and provide legal entitlements to eligible
individuals and households. In addition to these
schemes, many countries have a variety of nonstatutory programmes providing cash or in-kind
relief to children in need, often limited to certain
regions or districts and typically designed in
response to humanitarian crises or other nontypical circumstances. These are provided through
the government, or supported by UN agencies,
resource partners, NGOs or charities.
Figure 4.1 focuses mainly on cash benefits,
although a substantial number of interventions
consist of benefits in kind, such as school meals

or access to services. School
feeding programmes are

schoolchildren – 388 million –
receive school meals every

receiving school meals has
increased by 36 per cent since
2013 in low-income countries
(WFP 2020).

Combining cash
benefits and access to services

Social protection cash benefits and effective access
to services are often directly linked and mutually
reinforcing, particularly with regard to healthcare,
nutrition, childcare or education services and
productive inputs. These are of critical importance
for maximizing and sustaining the impacts of
cash transfers, particularly across multisector
outcomes, and for overcoming inequalities and
fostering social inclusion, especially of children
from marginalized families.
Social protection systems can play a key role
in promoting gender equality in various ways,
including by addressing the gendered division of
unpaid care and domestic work (SDG target 5.4).
From a young age, girls perform the majority
of unpaid care work (Muñoz Boudet et al. 2012),
and this early gender division of labour follows
women into their adult lives (ILO 2016f). Providing
affordable and quality childcare services would
not only free many girls from the burden of taking
care of their younger siblings; it could also have
salutary effects on women’s economic autonomy.
Depending on their design and delivery, social
protection schemes directed at families with
children can have the effect of reinforcing
traditional gender roles and responsibilities or
enhancing both children’s development and
women’s economic security (see box 4.4).

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

X Box 4.4 Making social protection work for both children and women
As those who carry out the bulk of childcare – whether as unpaid caregivers and/or as service providers
in day-care and preschool institutions – women have a huge stake in how benefits and services for
children are designed and delivered. However, the implications for women, as mothers or childcare
workers, have been insufficiently reflected in policies that focus on children (Razavi 2020; Staab 2019).
For instance, conditional cash transfers (CCTs) have been criticized for reinforcing traditional gender roles
while adding to women’s unpaid workloads (Bastagli et al. 2019; Cookson 2018; Fultz and Francis 2013;
Molyneux 2007).
In order to guarantee the income security and well-being of families with children, it is essential that both
women and men have access to adequate parental leave benefits and to early childhood education and
care services. Men can be given incentives to take up leave provisions by measures such as “daddy quotas”
that reserve a non-transferable portion of the leave for fathers on a use-it-or-lose-it basis (OECD 2016).
Measures adopted by employers to facilitate the sharing of work and family responsibilities for parents
with children can also play a key role (ILO 2016f). This combination of measures is particularly important
with a view to expanding women’s employment options by promoting a more equal distribution of
childcare within families. Both aspects are essential in breaking the cycle of gender inequalities which
trap women in informal, low-paid jobs without any social protection, both during their working lives and
in old age (Alfers 2016; Moussié 2016).
The aim is not to reduce or eliminate unpaid care work, as this work provides the foundation for socioeconomic life and contributes to progress on the SDGs. Rather, the objective is to reduce its drudgery,
equalize its distribution between women and men within families, and shift some of the work to
affordable and good-quality care services delivered by care workers who are adequately paid with access
to social protection (UN Women 2018). Investing in the triad of childcare services, parental leave and child
benefits can enhance both child development objectives and women’s economic autonomy, while also
creating decent jobs in the care sector.
Policymakers and development partners need to consider how child-oriented policies can be better
designed and implemented to serve the needs of both children and women. UNICEF’s recent efforts to
focus on family-friendly policies that strive to connect children’s rights to women’s rights and promote
gender equality are a step in this direction (Richardson, Dugarova, et al. 2020). However, much more
needs to be done to ensure that policies directed at children do not adversely affect women, both during
COVID‑19 and beyond (SPIAC-B 2020; UNDP and UN Women 2020; Bierbaum and Cichon 2019).

all regions, effective coverage remains the lowest
in Africa, where the rate is 12.6 per cent and only
10.5 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa, the subregion
where child poverty is highest.

The vast majority of children still have no effective
social protection coverage. Effective coverage
figures for SDG indicator 1.3.1 show that just
26.4 per cent of children globally receive child or
family benefits, with significant regional disparities
(see figure 4.2). Effective coverage rates vary
significantly across regions: while 82.3 per cent of
children in Europe and Central Asia and 57.4 per
cent in the Americas receive benefits, this is the
case for only 18 per cent of children in Asia and
the Pacific, and 15.4 per cent in the Arab States. Of

While the overall effective coverage rate in
high-income countries is high, at 86.8 per cent,
it is just one tenth of this figure, 8.5 per cent, in
low-income countries, which is a matter of grave
concern (see figure 4.3). Low-income countries
are often affected by protracted humanitarian
crises, locking children in a perpetual cycle of
poverty. Progress on closing coverage gaps in
these contexts requires urgent acceleration. To do
this, inter-agency efforts are needed to improve
the collection of social protection coverage and
expenditure data for children (see box 4.5).

Institutionalized monitoring of and reporting on social protection for children are required to facilitate
routine inter-agency reporting. Establishing this capability entails improving social protection data
collection concerning children and creating a periodic inter-agency publication that reports on social
protection for children, bringing together all relevant information, including comprehensive assessments
of both statutory and effective coverage. This will provide accurate information on, for example, how
much governments are spending consistently for all children on social protection and related services.

The need for a comprehensive, adequate and
child-sensitive programme and a systems
approach (see figure 4.4) is of fundamental
importance for ensuring all children’s welfare
and their families’ economic stability (UNICEF
2019b). This requires family benefits to be paid at
adequate rates to meet children’s needs across all
settings, especially in fragile contexts.

According to UN human rights frameworks
and international standards (see box 4.2),
all children should have access to, at least,
healthcare and basic income securit y that
guarantees “access to nutrition, education, care
and any other necessary goods and services”

The need for a comprehensive, adequate and
child-sensitive programme and a systems
approach is of fundamental importance
for ensuring all children’s welfare.

identity and rural/urban divisions.

(Recommendation No. 202, Para. 5(b)). Although
the Recommendation allows for the levels of
provision to be nationally defined, it also provides
clear guidance about what may be considered
appropriate: the minimum level of income security
should allow for life in dignity and should be
sufficient to provide for effective access to a set
of necessary goods and services, such as may be
set out through national poverty lines and other
comparable thresholds (Para. 8(b)).

ILO Recommendation No. 202 allows for a
broad range of policy instruments to achieve
income security for children. This goal can best
be attained via an integrated systems approach,
and adequacy can best be achieved through a
complementary portfolio of child policies (UNICEF
2019b), comprising both cash benefits and
services. As depicted in figure 4.4, this should be
sensitive to the child’s developmental life course,
the family context (family size and children’s ages),
and the personal attributes of the child (taking into
account factors such as migrant status, disability
and gender).

Benefits should be set at levels that relate directly
to the actual cost of providing for a child and
should represent a substantial contribution to
this cost; and family allowances at the minimum
rate should be granted regardless of household
income. Benefits above the minimum rate may be
subject to a means test, in order to make available
adequate resources to achieve basic standards
in those families most vulnerable to poverty
and deprivation. As the costs of meeting living
standards are affected by inflation, ILO instruments
require that benefits be regularly indexed to
respond to changes in the costs of achieving these
standards (ILO 2011b, paras 184–186).

One way of determining the adequacy of social
protection is to assess the extent to which it
reduces child poverty. In the European Union in
the past decade, the reduction in child income
poverty after taxes and social protection benefits
falls in the range 36–41 per cent of market income
(see figure 4.5). For example, in 2019 the pre-tax
“at risk of poverty” rate of 31.5 per cent fell to
18.5 per cent on average after taxes and transfers.
Effectively, this represents a reduction in the
poverty risk in the child population of 41 per cent.

To determine what is adequate for all children,
national policies also need to take account of
the additional needs specific to child migrants

across countries: while countries in Europe and
Central Asia and in Asia and the Pacific spend
more than 1 per cent of GDP, in other parts of the
world expenditure ratios remain well below 1 per
cent of GDP: regional estimates for Africa, the
Arab States and the Americas show expenditure
levels of 0.7 per cent of GDP or below, even though
children represent a large share of populations in
these regions. An average expenditure level of
only 0.1 per cent of GDP in low-income countries
is particularly striking when it is recalled that
children aged 0–14 years comprise 41.8 per cent
of their aggregate population.

Ensuring adequate social protection requires
sufficient resources to be allocated for children and
families. Yet average social protection expenditure
for children (excluding health expenditure) across
the world currently amounts to only 1.1 per cent
of GDP (see figure 4.6). There is great variation

The high levels of child poverty and shortfalls in
other indicators of well-being, discussed above,
indicate that the level of resources allocated
to child social protection is insufficient. Recent
evidence underlines the significant role played by
social protection expenditure, and child-sensitive
public spending more broadly, in meeting child

In Europe, while social protection can make large
inroads into poverty, it cannot eliminate poverty,
and access to additional services and decent
work for caregivers is also needed. However, a
comprehensive package of benefits and services
to help eradicate child poverty and ensure
children’s well-being requires a commitment to
adequate expenditure.

welfare needs, making progress towards the
SDGs and mitigating health and economic shocks
(Richardson, Carraro, et al. 2020; Richardson,
Dugarova, et al. 2020). The low expenditure
levels in low-income and lower-middle-income
countries, many of which do not provide any
benefits at all for children, jeopardize the rights
and future development potential of children and
the realization of the child-related SDGs.
Aggregate levels of public expenditure are useful
for comparing overall fiscal space for child policy
provisions. An understanding of the efficiency and
effectiveness of overall expenditure patterns will
require analysis of how the money is distributed
within a child population, according to age and
need (taking account of factors such as household
income, deprivation, inequality, disability and
so on), aligned with principles of adequacy, as
discussed above, as well as improvements in
expenditure data (see UNICEF 2019b).

4.1.6 Building social protection
systems for children
X

Progress towards universal social
protection for children

Accelerating the coverage, comprehensiveness
and adequacy of social protection for children
requires an integrated systems approach,
whether building new systems or strengthening
existing ones. One promising development
for both systems strengthening and improved
provision has been a growing interest in and
momentum related to the idea of UCBs. A number
of countries have progressively extended the
coverage of such benefits, or have plans to do
so (see table 4.1). Furthermore, in several other
countries, including Angola, Botswana, Sri Lanka
and Tunisia, governments are actively considering
UCBs or qUCBs as a social policy instrument
(Harman et al. 2020; ODI and UNICEF 2020; Kidd
et al. 2020). In South Asia, these measures have
been advocated as an emergency COVID‑19
response (UNICEF 2020a). Argentina represents
an important example of how universal coverage
can be approached through a combination of
contributory and non-contributory transfers,
having progressively achieved an effective
coverage rate of 87.4 per cent, with an additional
1.6 million children still to be covered (Aulicino,
Waisgrais, and Orton 2019).

These developments give a flavour of policy action
on extending child social protection in middle- and
lower-income countries. However, much more
needs to be done to extend coverage to migrant
and forcibly displaced children, who typically lack
statutory coverage. One promising and rather
exceptional development along these lines is
the expansion of Turkey’s national Conditional
Cash Transfer for Education scheme to include
over 650,000 refugee children since mid-2017
(UNICEF 2020b).
While universal coverage is generally a feature
of high-income countries, here too there remain
significant coverage, comprehensiveness and
adequacy gaps to be closed (see table 4.1). This
became especially evident during the pandemic,
when many of these countries had to extend their
provision (Stewart, Bastagli, and Orton 2020).

X

Retrenchment and curbed ambitions

Despite all these positive developments, several
countries have undergone fiscal consolidation
policies in the last decade. Examples include
the United Kingdom’s 2012 “deuniversalization”
of its UCB into an affluence-tested qUCB and
marginal reforms to other high-income countries’
UCBs (see ILO and UNICEF 2019). Furthermore,
Mexico’s much-lauded Prospera CCT programme
was abolished in 2019, illustrating the particular
vulnerabilit y of targeted programmes to
discontinuation (Kidd 2019). In Kyrgyzstan, a
planned legal reform of 2017 introducing a
child benefit for all children aged 0–3 years was
suspended because of political volatility and
discouragement from the World Bank and IMF.
In Mongolia, the IMF imposed loan conditions in
2017 that have increased targeting of its initially
universal Child Money Programme (Development
Pathways 2018; ILO and UNICEF 2019; IMF 2017a;
UNICEF 2020c).
Such developments deny many children their
legitimate right to social protection. In this context,
more resources need to be allocated to financing
social protection and other services for children to
ensure that the child-related SDGs are achieved.
This means that, where possible, policymakers
and development partners should attempt to
harness the momentum gathering behind UCBs
to advance coverage for children and pursue a
“high-road” approach to policy for children. The
relative simplicity of UCBs conceals a powerful
added value they possess: they can “hard-wire”
the overall policy architecture, thereby helping to
build systems for children and to optimize welfare
provision (see box 4.6).

European Union

2021

More than 25 per cent of all children in the European Union are
at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Consequently, the European
Commission issued a Council Recommendation Establishing a
European Child Guarantee, to prevent and combat child poverty and
social exclusion, and declared its intention to support members in
realizing this guarantee.

Italy

2021

A law came into force in April 2021 adopting an affluence-tested
qUCB, with the first benefit to be disbursed on 1 July. The benefit will
be paid to the majority of families with children, from the seventh
month of pregnancy until the child is 18 (or 21 for dependent children
in full-time education).

Lithuania

2018

A UCB for children aged 0–18 years (up to 21 if in education) was
introduced in the Law on Benefits to Children to address challenges in
the country’s child tax allowance (Lazutka, Poviliunas, and Zalimiene
2019).

Montenegro

2021
(proposed)

The Government submitted a proposal for amendments to the Law
on Social and Child Protection to introduce a qUCB for ages 0–6 years.

Republic of Korea

2018

A qUCB for children aged 0–6 years was introduced by the Ministry of
Health and Welfare under the Law on Benefits to Children in 2018 and
extended to 0–7 years in 2019.

2019

The Child Support Grant was expanded from 0–3 years to all children
under the age of 6 years from poor families, covering around 2 million
children in 2020 (UNICEF 2019c).

United States

2021

As a pandemic response and to address long-standing child poverty
and exclusion of marginalized children, the Government expanded
the eligibility criteria of its existing Child Tax Credit for one year.
This change increases inclusivity and pays a higher-value benefit
more regularly. Legislation to make this reform permanent is being
considered (Richardson et al. 2021).

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

X Box 4.6 Strengthening systems through universal child benefits
Evidence from countries with long-established UCBs demonstrates that they help to achieve greater
poverty reduction than narrow means-tested benefits. Moreover, in countries currently without UCBs,
simulations show that a UCB scheme costing just 1 per cent of GDP would reduce child poverty rates by
as much as 20 per cent (ODI and UNICEF 2020). This alone is good reason for policymakers to consider
a UCB. However, UCBs have additional positive effects beyond their poverty-reduction properties: the
fact that they are provided for all children as a right can reinforce human rights and principles of equality
and non-discrimination; universality of provision can also reduce the stigma often attached to benefits
that are targeted at the poor and thereby enhance recipients’ dignity. Other comparative advantages
include lower administrative costs, simplified eligibility criteria and a negligible risk of exclusion errors.
These qualities help maximize take-up (ODI and UNICEF 2020).
A less widely recognized rationale for adopting UCBs is that they function as social protection “linchpins”.
In other words, UCBs can support the building of social protection systems and decent societies for
children. For example, they can encourage the registration of births, thereby making children and their
physical whereabouts more visible to state institutions. As children grow, the payment of UCBs can
provide further incentives for families to stay in contact with state institutions and services, which in turn
enables better planning and resource allocation to support essential services.
There are compelling reasons for the introduction of UCBs in contexts of fragility and forced displacement.
A system where every child is reached is automatically primed to reach the most vulnerable and to
provide transfers on the required scale for all, including forcibly displaced populations. In fragile contexts
where capacity is generally limited and a very high proportion of children are vulnerable, a universal
approach, rather than efforts to target certain groups, also makes practical sense. Universal approaches
could lay the foundations for a national system that is ready to scale up during recovery, forming part of
the backbone of a fledgling social protection system (ILO and UNICEF 2019).
A UCB, then, can be a pillar of a comprehensive social protection system and help to optimize design
and delivery of other services. All these factors represent important lessons for countries that are
contemplating the best way to guarantee social protection and decent lives for their children.

Policy priorities
and recommendations
for enhancing social protection
for children

A number of policy actions stand out as deserving
priority in order to address the pandemic’s
continuing fallout and achieve SDG target 1.3
for children.
X To ensure children’s well-being and achieve

the SDGs, fiscal austerity must be avoided.
The pandemic’s adverse effects on children
will be protracted. All the evidence indicates
that child income poverty is likely to increase
and to remain above pre-COVID levels for up
to five years in many countries (Richardson,
Carraro, et al. 2020). This is a critical time for
governments to ensure that every child’s right

to social protection is realized; this requires
support for child-specific social protection
investments as part of COVID‑19 response and
fiscal stimulus measures.
X Countries should rapidly move towards

universal social protection for children,
including universal child benefits. COVID‑19
has both emphasized the importance of
strong social protection systems and opened
a policy window in which countries can make
progress on universal social protection for
children. Increasing the effective coverage,
comprehensi venes s and adequac y of
provision is possible, practically and fiscally,
will have a substantial impact and is in line
with international obligations (ODI and
UNICEF 2020; Ortiz et al. 2017). The policy
window provided by COVID‑19 must be used
to prioritize investments to close critical gaps.

99

100 X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

X It is crucial that social protection systems

ensure adequacy in terms of inclusion and
gender sensitivity, and that they address
climate-related and conflict-related risks.
The pandemic has highlighted the fact that,
while the poorest and most vulnerable groups
and communities experience the worst impacts
of such shocks, they are the least adequately
covered by social protection. To remedy this
situation, inclusive policies and programmes
must be developed, with particular attention
being paid to the needs of girls and women,
children with disabilities and migrant children.
Significant work is also needed to ensure that
social protection programmes are prepared
to respond to future crises, and that nascent
social protection systems in fragile contexts are
supported.

X It is also of paramount importance that

policymakers implement an integrated
social protection portfolio for children.
Child and family benef its that directly
address the financial barriers that impede the
realization of children’s rights and potential
are a crucial foundation of social protection for
children. However, they need to be part of an
integrated systems approach that also includes
coordinated childcare ser vices, parental
leave provisions and access to healthcare. An
integrated systems approach will deliver the
best results for children and for wider society.

4.2 Social protection for women
and men of working age

X The COVID‑19 pandemic has reaffirmed the importance of

social protection in ensuring income security for women and
men of working age. In the light of earnings losses in the worst
economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s,
social protection systems have proven to be of key significance in
supporting incomes and aggregate demand, as well as protecting
and promoting human capabilities, thereby contributing to an
inclusive recovery.

X The COVID‑19 crisis has exposed significant coverage gaps for

people of working age in many parts of the world. Many countries
still lack collectively financed social security benefit schemes for
people of working age that provide short-term benefits in the
event of maternity, sickness, unemployment and employment
injury. In many countries, the only available mechanisms are
based on employer liability or private arrangements, often with
suboptimal results in terms of coverage, equity and sustainability.

X Globally, 3.6 per cent of GDP is allocated to non-health public social

protection expenditure for people of working age; regionally,
levels vary widely, ranging from 1.1 per cent in Africa to 7.7 per
cent in Europe and Central Asia.

X Effective coordination between social protection policies and

employment, labour market, wage and tax policies is of critical
importance in ensuring an inclusive and jobs-rich recovery
from the crisis.

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

4.2.1 Introduction: The quest
for income security
The majority of people of working age2 (61 per
cent of people aged 15 to 64 years; 74 per cent of
men and 47 per cent of women) are economically
ac tive and gain their livelihoods through
income-generating activities. 3 Many of them
work in precarious and insecure employment
arrangements, including in the informal economy,
with limited job and income security and in
poor working conditions (ILO 2018f). Another
significant share of the global population, most
of whom are women, perform unpaid care and
household work (ILO 2018a). All working-age
women and men need income security, whether
they are employed, self-employed, paid or unpaid,
seeking employment, temporarily or permanently
incapable of working, or in education.
Social protection systems have a central role to
play in supporting people of working age and their
families in coping with the financial consequences
of life events, in finding and sustaining decent and
productive employment, and in facilitating their
effective access to healthcare and other services.
This includes in particular income security in the
event of unemployment, employment injury,
disability, sickness or maternity, as well as when
earnings are insufficient. The COVID‑19 pandemic
has reaffirmed the importance of social protection
in ensuring income security for women and men
of working age. By partially or fully replacing lost
incomes and providing income support for those
affected, social protection systems have proven
to be key in protecting human capital and human
capabilities, smoothing incomes over people’s
lives and stabilizing aggregate demand (ILO
2021o, 2020w, 2020y, 2020s).
However, many people of working age – in
particular those in part-time or temporar y
employment, or who are self-employed – are
not covered, or are covered only insufficiently,
by either contributory or non-contributory social
protection programmes (ILO 2021h, 2017f, 2016d).

103

As a result, they remain unprotected against many
life contingencies, persistently susceptible to
poverty and vulnerability.
These large coverage gaps are attributable
to significant underinvestment. Worldwide,
about one third of total non-health public social
protection expenditure, amounting to 3.6 per cent
of GDP, is spent on benefits for people of working
age (see figure 4.7). These include maternity
benefits, unemployment benefits, employment
injury benefits, disability benefits and general
social assistance. Regional variations are
significant: while countries in Europe and Central
Asia invest 7.7 per cent of GDP in non-health social
protection for their working-age populations,
Africa reaches only 1.1 per cent, the Arab States
1.4 per cent and Asia and the Pacific 1.7 per cent.
Among low- and lower-middle-income countries,
non-health social protection expenditure remains
well below 1 per cent of GDP, largely because
people of working age represent a smaller share of
the population in these countries, and because of
the relative underdevelopment of social protection
programmes for people of working age.
The COVID‑19 crisis has further exacerbated
unemployment, underemployment, economic
inactivity and dwindling labour incomes, and
has contributed to increases in working poverty,
informality and inequality in many contexts.
These trends have increased the strains on social
protection systems to ensure income security
for people of working age (ILO 2021k, 2016d,
2016a, 2017e; Berg 2015a). The crisis has once
again highlighted the fact that income security
cannot be achieved by social
protection systems alone.

Working age is broadly defined here as the age range during which most people are, or seek to be, economically active,
reflecting the life-cycle approach of Recommendation No. 202, while recognizing that, in many contexts, women and men
continue to be economically active, out of choice or necessity, until well into old age (see section 4.3). The upper and lower
boundaries of “working age” are highly dependent on national contexts, as defined by national legislation and practice, and
are often related to the length of time that people spend in education and to statutory pensionable ages. For the purpose
of the comparability of statistical indicators, this report follows established international practice in using an age range of
15–64 years, but this is not to imply that all individuals within this age range can or should conform to a specific notion of
“work” or “economic activity”.

key importance for the achievement of the SDGs,

country’s responsibility to implement the most effective and efficient combination of benefits and schemes in its national
context, selecting from a repertoire including universal benefit schemes, social insurance schemes, social assistance
schemes, negative income tax schemes, public employment schemes and employment support schemes.

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

The remainder of this section of Chapter 4 is
divided into five subsections, dealing in turn with
the areas of social security that are most relevant
to people of working age, namely:
X maternity protection and paternity and

parental leave benefits (section 4.2.2);

X sickness protection (section 4.2.3);
X employment injury protection (section 4.2.4);
X disability benefits (section 4.2.5); and
X unemployment protection (section 4.2.6).

5

W ithin each of these subsec tions , both
contributory and non-contributory schemes
are discussed, taking into account the fact that
universal coverage is often achieved through a
combination of different types of schemes, so as to
allow the extension of social protection coverage
to those with weak or no contributory capacities.
While the primary focus is on cash benefits, it
should be noted that benefits in kind, in particular
healthcare, care and other social services,5 play a
major role in ensuring income security for people
of working age. Access to healthcare is discussed
in more detail in section 4.4. Together, these
schemes contribute to building national social
protection systems, including floors.

These include, for example, employment services, skills development programmes, childcare facilities and long-term
care services that have significant implications for income security, particularly for women (Martinez Franzoni and
Sánchez‑Ancochea 2015).

105

X The COVID‑19 pandemic has adversely affected childbearing

women by increasing the risk of employment and livelihood
loss, and by raising the barriers to pre- and postnatal care and
skilled delivery through disruptions in the healthcare system and
other public services. At the same time, maternity protection has
received very little attention in COVID‑19 response measures,
with only ten countries announcing measures to ensure income
security for pregnant women during the final stages of pregnancy
and after childbirth.

X Lack of income security during the final stages of pregnancy

and after childbirth forces many women, especially those in the
informal economy, to keep working into the very late stages
of pregnancy and/or to return to work prematurely, thereby
exposing themselves and their children to significant health risks.
Those women who are physically unable to continue working are
at greater risk of poverty owing to the loss of income. This risk is
exacerbated when social health protection is low and the cost of
seeking care is paid out of pocket.

X Estimates of effective coverage for SDG indicator 1.3.1 show that

only 44.9 per cent of women with newborns worldwide receive a
maternity cash benefit, with large regional variations: coverage
of childbearing women is universal in most of Europe, compared
to a mere 7.5 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.

X Maternity protection includes income security (through cash

benefits), leave policies and effective access to good-quality
maternal healthcare for pregnant women and mothers
of newborns. In addition, employment and labour market
interventions such as employment protection and nondiscrimination, childcare solutions after the woman’s return to
work and good occupational health and safety measures and
breastfeeding facilities at the workplace are important to give
adequate protection to pregnant women and new mothers.

X Paid paternity and parental leave recognize that both mothers

and fathers have responsibilities as caregivers and contributors to
household income, and facilitate a more equitable sharing of care
responsibilities, in line with SDG target 5.4 on gender equality.

A comprehensive approach
to maternity protection

Maternity protection is essential to prevent and
reduce poverty and vulnerability, promote the
health, nutrition and well-being of mothers,
achieve gender equality and advance decent work.
It comprises income security, maternal healthcare,
maternity leave, breastfeeding arrangements,
employment protection and childcare solutions
after return to work. While significant progress
has been made, it is estimated that far too many
women still face impoverishment or suffer from
preventable consequences of complications during
pregnancy or childbirth. In 2017, 295,000 women
died of causes related to pregnancy and childbirth,
86 per cent of those deaths occurring in subSaharan Africa and South Asia (WHO 2020e). From
a social protection perspective, ensuring effective
access to maternal healthcare and income security
in the critical period before and after childbirth are
essential (ILO 2020x, 2019f, 2018g).
As a fundamental element of maternity protection
and social health protection, good maternal
healthcare provides for effective access to
adequate healthcare and services – including
reproductive health services – during pregnancy
and childbirth and beyond, to ensure the health of
both mothers and children. As with social health
protection in general (see section 4.4), a lack of
coverage puts the health of women and children at
risk and exposes families to significantly increased
risk of poverty.
UNICEF estimates that 116 million children
were born between the WHO declaration of the
COVID‑19 outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March
2020 and the end of that year. The pandemic
compromises access to maternal and other health
services (already scarce in many countries even
before the pandemic; see section 4.4), owing to
the significant disruption of health systems it has
caused, including pre- and postnatal care, skilled
delivery and neonatal care services (UNICEF
2020b). Models estimate a resulting increase
in maternal mortality, even in the least severe
scenario, of at least 8 per cent over six months
(Roberton et al. 2020). In order to prevent a further
deterioration of maternal and newborn outcomes,
the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
calls for maternity services to be prioritized as
an essential core health service, alongside other
sexual and reproductive health services such
as family planning, emergency contraception,

treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and
safe abortion, among others, that need to be
maintained during the pandemic (UNFPA 2020).
In addition to providing good-quality maternal
healthcare, maternity cash benefits are of critical
importance for the well-being of pregnant women,
new mothers and their families, not least in order
to enable adequate nutrition during pregnancy
and breastfeeding. The absence of income security
forces many women to keep working into the very
late stages of pregnancy and/or to return to work
prematurely after the birth, thereby exposing
themselves and their children to significant
health risks. Women in the informal economy
are particularly vulnerable to the risks of income
insecurity and ill health because of discrimination,
unsafe and insecure working conditions, lack of
employment protection, often low and volatile
incomes, limited freedom of association, lack
of representation in collective bargaining
processes and lack of access to social insurance
(ILO 2016f). The challenges facing women in the
informal economy are often compounded by
other factors. For example, indigenous women
are 25.6 percentage points more likely to work in
the informal economy than their non-indigenous
counterparts (86.5 per cent versus 60.9 per cent)
(ILO 2020b).
The COVID‑19 crisis has rendered pregnant
women more vulnerable to income shocks and
impoverishment, more likely to be laid off or
lose their livelihoods in other ways and less
likely to be able to return to work. Despite these
increased risks, only a very few governments have
introduced specific maternity-related measures
in their COVID‑19 social protection response
packages: only ten measures on income security
in ten countries, or 0.4 per cent out of some
1,600 measures introduced in over 200 countries
or territories, are linked to maternity, placing
this function second from last of the functions
addressed by the response measures (see
figure 3.2). In some cases, too, the design of
COV ID‑19 response measures has created
access barriers for women. For example, reliance
on digital methods of outreach, registration
and payout may have exclusionary effects for
women – as for other vulnerable groups – owing to
the gendered aspect of the digital divide, namely
the uneven distribution of ownership of, access to
and knowledge of new technologies (EBRD 2020;
Holmes et al. 2020).

110 X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

X Box 4.7 International standards relevant to maternity protection
Women’s right to maternity protection is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of
1948, which sets out the right to social security and special care and assistance for motherhood and
childhood. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) establishes the
right of mothers to special protection during a reasonable period before and after childbirth, including
prenatal and postnatal healthcare and paid leave or leave with adequate social security benefits. The
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979) recommends that
special measures be taken to ensure maternity protection, proclaimed as an essential right permeating
all areas of the Convention.
Since the adoption by the ILO of the Maternity Protection Convention, 1919 (No. 3), in the very year of
its foundation, a number of more progressive instruments have been adopted, in line with the steady
increase in women’s participation in the labour market in most countries worldwide. The Social Security
(Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), Part VIII, sets minimum standards as to the population
coverage of maternity protection schemes, including cash benefits during maternity leave, to address the
temporary suspension of earnings (see Annex 3, table A3.7). The Convention also defines the medical care
that must be provided free of charge at all stages of maternity, to maintain, restore or improve women’s
health and their ability to work (see also box 4.26). Further, it provides that free maternal healthcare must
be available to women and the spouses of men covered by maternity protection schemes.
The Maternity Protection Convention, 2000 (No. 183), and its accompanying Recommendation (No. 191),
provide detailed guidance for national policymaking and action aiming to ensure that women:
X are granted at least 14 weeks of maternity leave paid at a rate of at least two thirds of previous earnings

(Convention No. 183) or up to 18 weeks at 100 per cent (Recommendation No. 191);

X have employment protection during pregnancy, maternity leave and the right to return to the same

or an equivalent position;

X enjoy the right to one or more daily nursing breaks or a daily reduction of hours of work to breastfeed

their children; and

X are not required to perform work prejudicial to their health or that of their children.

In order to protect women’s rights in the labour market and prevent discrimination by employers, ILO
maternity protection standards specifically require that cash benefits be provided through schemes
based on solidarity and risk-pooling, such as compulsory social insurance or public funds, while strictly
circumscribing the potential liability of employers for the direct cost of benefits.
Recommendation No. 202 calls for access to essential healthcare, including maternity care and basic
income security, for people of working age who are unable to earn sufficient income owing to (among
other factors) maternity. Cash benefits should be sufficient to allow women a life in dignity and without
poverty. Maternity medical care should meet criteria of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality
(UN, 2000a); it should be free for the most vulnerable; and it should not create hardship or increase the
risk of poverty for people in need of healthcare. Maternity benefits should be granted to all residents of
a country. Reinforcing the objective of achieving universal protection, the Transition from the Informal
to the Formal Economy Recommendation, 2015 (No. 204), calls for the extension of maternity protection
to all workers in the informal economy.

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

According to international labour standards (see
box 4.7), maternity protection includes not only
income security and access to healthcare, but
also the right to interrupt work activities, to rest
and to recover around childbirth. It ensures the
protection of women’s right to work and rights
at work during maternity and beyond, through
measures that prevent risks, protect women
from unhealthy and unsafe working conditions
and environments, safeguard their employment,
protect them against discrimination and dismissal,
and allow them to return to their jobs after
maternity leave under conditions that take into
account their specific circumstances, including
the need for breastfeeding (ILO 2016c; Addati,
Cassirer, and Gilchrist 2014; ILO et al. 2012). From

A diversity of schemes providing
maternity protection

In 143 out of the 195 countries and territories
for which information was available, periodic
maternity cash benefits are anchored in national
social security legislation and provided through
collectively financed mechanisms: either social
insurance that fully or partially replaces women’s
earnings during the final stages of pregnancy and
after childbirth, or non-contributory schemes
that provide at least a basic level of income (see
figure 4.8). Almost all of these countries (137) had
social insurance schemes, of which eight also
operate non-contributory tax-financed schemes.6
Forty-seven other countries – most of them in
Africa or Asia – have provisions in their labour
legislation for a mandatory period of maternity
6

leave and establish the employer’s liability for
the salary (or a percentage thereof ) during
that period. Eighteen countries combine social
insurance and employer liability mechanisms.
Three countries provide maternity cash benefits
exclusively through non-contributory schemes.
In another three countries, women may take
unpaid maternity leave, but do not benefit from
income replacement.
The Maternity Protection Convention, 2000
(No. 183), recommends that countries introduce
collectively financed maternity benefits (social
insurance or tax-financed) rather than relying
on employer’s liability provisions. This improves
equality of treatment for men and women in the
labour market because it shifts the burden of
bearing the costs of maternity benefits from the
individual employer to the collective, reducing
discrimination against women of childbearing age
in hiring and in employment, and the risk of nonpayment of due compensation by the employer.
Such reforms can also facilitate the coverage of
women with low contributory capacities and
interrupted employment histories, including
those in part-time or temporary employment,
and those in self-employment.
In some countries, pregnant and childbearing
women can benefit from non-contributor y
cash transfer programmes. However, these
programmes are often not anchored in law
and tend to cover only a small fraction of the
population with often very modest benefit
amounts that do not allow women to withdraw
temporarily from paid or unpaid work. As a result,
women continue working too far into pregnancy
or return to work too soon after childbirth, with
potentially negative effects on their own and their
babies’ health. Finally, in many low- and lowermiddle-income countries, these cash transfer
programmes come with behavioural conditions
which tend to reinforce the traditional division of
paid and unpaid care work between women and
men (ILO 2016f, 2016c) (see box 4.4 in section 4.1
and box 4.8 below). For example, receipt of
benefits may be conditional on uptake of pre- and
postnatal care, skilled delivery or health check-ups
for and vaccination of the child, and sanctions
may be applied if the conditions are not fulfilled.
Unless those services are affordable, accessible
geographically, of high quality and culturally
acceptable for women, conditionalities will result
in women obtaining neither the cash benefit nor
the needed health services.

For more detailed characteristics of the schemes in place, see also Annex 4.

some or all of the leave to which a woman is entitled under the Act. A cash benefit may be provided at the state level.
Additionally, employers may offer paid maternity leave as a job benefit.

In some countries, universal coverage and
adequate benefit levels for maternity protection
are achieved by combining contributory and
non-contributory mechanisms. In Portugal, for
example, women who are not entitled to paid
maternity leave from social insurance receive
a tax-financed maternity benefit. The effective

coordination of these mechanisms within the
social protection system is essential to guarantee
at least a basic level, or floor, of income security for
women workers who become pregnant. Likewise,
cash and care benefits need to be well integrated,
requiring coordination between health and social
protection sectors.

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

X Box 4.8 The motherhood penalty: Why mothers bear a cost

in terms of employment, wages and leadership positions

The focus of maternity protection is on the protection of the mother during a period of increased
vulnerability and special need for protection around childbirth. However, maternity protection measures
and the design of family policies more broadly (see also section 4.1) have profound implications for gender
equality and women’s rights beyond delivery and childbirth. Social norms and structural inequalities,
such as persistent gender pay gaps, continue to compel women to be the main caregivers and men to
work longer hours as the main earners of household income. As a result, mothers of young children are
less likely to be employed than women without children, fathers and men without children. Emerging
evidence from Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Mexico shows that partnered women with children have
experienced sharper pandemic-related drops in labour force participation than men – and that these
are most pronounced for women living with children aged under 6 years (Azcona et al. 2020). Women
with children also receive lower wages and are less likely than men, and less likely than women or men
without children, to work in managerial or leadership positions (ILO 2019f). All these factors effectively
penalize women when they have children – the so-called motherhood penalty.
The trend is troubling: between 2005 and 2015, the motherhood employment penalty has increased
by 38.4 per cent, and while mothers earn lower wages than women without children, fathers are more
likely to receive higher pay than men without children: a fatherhood bonus (ILO 2019f). The motherhood
wage penalty varies significantly across countries. It ranges from 1 per cent or less in countries such as
Canada, Mongolia and South Africa to almost 15 per cent in the Russian Federation and as much as 30 per
cent in Turkey (ILO 2019f). Lone mothers are particularly severely affected, as demonstrated by their
significantly higher poverty rates compared with two-parent families (UN Women 2019). Ironically, lowincome women, who can least afford it, bear the largest proportionate penalty for motherhood, while
the fatherhood bonus largely accrues to men at the very top of the income distribution (Budig 2014).
The main drivers behind the disadvantages that women with children face are the unequal distribution
of unpaid care work within families (see figure 4.9), the lack of affordable and good-quality care services
(childcare, long-term care and support for people with disabilities) as well as discriminatory attitudes
and expectations around gender roles. Other contributory factors are a lack of career breaks for paid
and unpaid maternity and care leave, reductions in hours of work, lack of flexible work solutions, lack of
sickness benefits for sick children, masculine corporate cultures and related gender-biased hiring and
promotion decisions at the enterprise level.

Coverage of maternity
cash benefits

Strictly speaking, maternity protection starts even
before conception, with the ability of women to
freely determine the number of children they
want to have, and at what intervals, through
access to affordable and good-quality family
planning (Folbre 2021). In the absence of such
services, women carry the social, economic and
health consequences of unwanted pregnancies
or unsafe abortions, which are especially severe
in the case of adolescent mothers. Recent
estimates show that most adolescent mothers
live in developing regions, and that adolescent
pregnancy disproportionately affects women
from economically disadvantaged groups (UN
Women 2019). Similarly, there is evidence that
inequality in access to reproductive health
and rights between wealth quintiles persists
in a number of lower-middle-income countries
(WHO 2020e).

Worldwide, roughly every second woman who
becomes pregnant is not protected against loss
of income. As figure 4.10 shows, only 43.8 per
cent of the female labour force are entitled to
maternity benefits through social insurance, and
just 9.7 per cent are covered through statutory
non-contributory benefits.
Moreover, not all women legally covered have
effective access to their entitlements. Only
44.9 per cent of women giving birth actually
receive maternity cash benefits (see figure 4.11).
Forty-seven countries achieve close to universal
coverage, with more than 90 per cent of pregnant
women receiving maternity cash benefits, while in
23 countries (most of them in sub-Saharan Africa)
this proportion is less than 10 per cent (figures 4.11
and 4.12). While in high-income countries 86 per
cent of childbearing women are covered, this is
the case for only 10.5 per cent of women in lowincome countries. Coverage gaps largely relate to
the prevalence of informal employment and the
lack of appropriate mechanisms to cover women
outside formal employment.

Adequacy of maternity benefits,
in duration and amount, in ensuring
income security during maternity
leave

The adequacy of cash benefits provided during
maternity leave can be assessed in terms of their
duration and amount. The purpose of maternity
leave is rehabilitation; therefore, the leave needs to
be sufficiently long for women to rest and recover.
In contrast, longer periods of parental leave (in
some countries more than one year) allow fathers
and mothers to take care of
the child and balance work
and family obligations. These
entitlements can typically be

long periods of parent al
leave for mothers have been
shown to produce adverse effects for women’s
employment and career opportunities (Mandel
and Semyonov 2006).
Of the 183 countries for which data were available
in the ISSA country profiles,7 174 provide statutory
periodic maternity cash benefits in order to allow
women to rest before and recover fully after
childbirth. Of these, 59 countries provide at least
14 weeks’ paid maternity leave, meeting the
standards of Convention No. 183, and 42 countries
provide benefits for 18 weeks or more as advised
in Recommendation No. 191. In 42 countries, the
length of paid maternity leave is 12–13 weeks,
which meets the minimum standard set out in
Convention No. 102. In 31 countries, maternity
leave with cash benefits is provided for less
than 12 weeks.
The level of the maternity cash benefit, calculated
as a proportion of women’s previous earnings for
a minimum number of weeks of paid maternity
leave, varies widely. In 66 out of the 174 countries
providing statutory periodic maternity cash
benefits, women are entitled to paid maternity
leave of at least two thirds of their regular salary
for a minimum period of 14 weeks, meeting the
benchmark of Convention No. 183. In 23 countries,
women are entitled to 100 per cent of their regular
salary for at least 18 weeks, meeting the highest

standard set out in Recommendation No. 191. In
47 countries, women are entitled to benefits at a
level of 45 per cent or more of previous earnings
for a minimum of 12–13 weeks, which is in line
with the minimum requirements of Convention
No. 102. In 38 countries, however, the cash
benefit corresponds to less than 45 per cent of
the previous salary and/or the period of paid
maternity leave is under 12 weeks.

Access to maternity care

Effective access to free, affordable and appropriate
prenatal and postnatal healthcare and services for
pregnant women and mothers with newborns is
an essential component of maternity protection
and social health protection alike. It is important to
achieve progress towards SDG targets 3.1, 3.2, 3.8
and 5.6 on reducing maternal and child mortality,
reaching universal health coverage and achieving
gender equality. Access to maternity care is
part of access to healthcare in general, which is
highlighted in SDG target 3.8 and discussed in
detail in section 4.4 below.
Where effective access to healthcare is not
universal, economic deprivation too of ten
translates into health deprivation (see section 4.4),
resulting also in significant inequities regarding
access to maternity care, for example between
urban and rural areas, and between richer
and poorer groups of the population (see
figure 4.46). The lack of skilled health personnel
with adequate working conditions plays a key
role in the persistence of these coverage gaps.
These inequalities have detrimental effects on
maternal health, with often harmful long-term
consequences for poverty reduction, gender
equality and women’s economic empowerment.
The cost of accessing maternity care, and the
importance to the health of both mother and
child of physical rest around childbirth and
adequate nutrition during pregnancy and when
breastfeeding, necessitate a comprehensive
approach to maternity protection. This can be
achieved by combining maternity care and income
security, complemented by occupational safety
and health measures, employment protection and
non-discrimination, and adequate breastfeeding
arrangements and childcare solutions after the
woman’s return to work, as stipulated in ILO
maternity protection standards.

Maternity protection, paternity
and parental leave at the
crossroads: Motherhood penalties
or universal adequate maternity
protection, leave policies and early
life services

Effective maternity protection is one of the key
social protection elements for improving the lives
of mothers, supporting the health and nutrition of
women and newborns alike, and contributing to
gender equality. Yet too many women across the
world do not enjoy adequate levels of maternity
protection, with regard to maternal care, income
security, maternity leave or labour protection.
Pregnancy and childbirth are uniquely female
experiences, meaning that women require a
period of leave to ensure physical recovery from
childbirth. In contrast, caring and
parenting are not uniquely female and
should be shared between the parents.

consequences for their health and
well-being. The difficulty of combining
family responsibilities with employment is one
of the reasons for the low fertility rates (below
the population replacement rate) in some highincome countries.
A more equitable sharing of care responsibilities
between women and men, in parallel with
adequate, af fordable public ser vices – in
particular, universal early childhood care and
education services – is thus crucial to achieve
SDG target 5.4 on gender equalit y and to
make progress towards larger socio-economic
objectives (ILO 2019f, 2018a). Gender-related
interventions in the framework of cash transfer
programmes have focused on breaking the
intergenerational cycle of poverty, particularly
for disadvantaged girl children, but have been

8

https://ww1.issa.int/country-profiles.

weaker in protecting women during pregnancy
and childbirth, and in promoting women’s
economic empowerment through employment or
other forms of sustainable livelihood. Addressing
these shortcomings requires maternity protection
to be considered as part of a comprehensive
approach to gender equality that promotes an
equal sharing of work and family responsibilities
between women and men. This means placing
parental leave within transformative care policies,
which guarantee the human rights, agency and
well-being of caregivers, as well as those of care
receivers, by avoiding potential trade-offs and
bridging opposing interests. The State should have
the overall and primary responsibility not only for
maternity leave, but also for care policies that
include the provision of public goods and services
in general, including paternity and parental leave,
childcare and long-term care.
Parental leave policies, part-time work, flexitime,
teleworking, sickness benefits for sick children,
breastfeeding arrangements and also tax policies
should be designed in such a way as to promote
gender equality at home and at work. Change is
under way, although unevenly across countries.
Forty years ago, the ILO Workers with Family
Responsibilities Convention, 1981 (No. 156), and
its accompanying Recommendation, No. 165,
opened the door to paternity and parental leave
entitlements; since then, some countries have
reformed their leave policies to facilitate greater
involvement of fathers in childcare by introducing
or extending paternity leave, as well as designing
parental leave in a way that encourages the
participation of fathers. European experience
shows that men’s effective use of parental leave
can be increased through higher replacement
rates (benefits as a percentage of pre-leave
earnings) and more flexible arrangements that
reserve a non-transferable proportion of the
parental leave for the father on a use-it-or-lose-it
basis (Folbre 2021; ILO 2019f). Yet some men are
still stigmatized for taking their entitlements. Of
the 183 countries for which data are available,8
just 16 provide leave entitlements for fathers or
the second parent, while paternity benefits are
provided in only 39 countries.

118 X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

Recognizing and promoting the participation
of men in household duties and care work at
home, as well as in the labour market, is as
important for gender equality as for creating
equal employment conditions for women. In the
absence of family policies that address both men
and women, leave policies risk creating adverse
labour market outcomes for women (Richardson,
Dugarova, et al. 2020). Good-quality, affordable
and accessible childcare services are the second
key pillar for supporting female labour force
participation (UN Women 2019). Public investment
in care services also constitutes a reliable means
of addressing social needs while creating decent
jobs – a potentially critical element for a postCOVID‑19 recovery.

COVID‑19 has shown the risks of retrogression
in gender equality as a result of shocks or
crises. The pandemic has at best stalled and at
worst reversed progress in fighting poverty,
social exclusion and gender inequality. During
lockdown, as schools, childcare and long-term
care facilities were disrupted, the lion’s share
of unpaid care work was again shouldered by
women. Women’s high representation in sectors
hardest hit by lockdown orders has translated
into larger declines in employment for women
than men in numerous countries, while domestic
violence has increased in frequency and severity
across countries (Kabeer, Razavi, and Rodgers
2021). Moreover, women, constituting close to
70 per cent of front-line workers in health and
social care occupations, have faced a higher risk
of contagion.9 And finally, pregnant women in
particular were more vulnerable to the pandemic
as there was initially no vaccine approved for use
during pregnancy.

eligibility criteria (such as waiting periods) may create gaps in
protection.

X Many countries have opted to provide paid sick leave fully or

partially through employers’ liability rather than sickness benefits,
which creates additional coverage gaps. In particular, sole reliance
on employers’ liability tends to exclude some categories of
workers and create discrimination against workers with chronic
conditions; also, it may have adverse labour market impacts and
is not appropriate in case of public health crises, as the COVID‑19
pandemic has illustrated.

X While the COVID‑19 crisis revealed important gaps in sickness

benefit coverage, shortage of data on effective coverage
constrains its monitoring under SDG target 1.3. More and better
data are urgently needed; a third of countries and territories in
the world do not report data.

X Though the impact of sickness on income loss remains little

researched, especially in low- and middle-income countries, a
growing body of evidence from patient cost surveys of major
diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) illustrates its depth and the
poverty risks it creates. These trends highlight the need to give
sickness benefits high priority in the extension of social protection
coverage.

X Box 4.9 Key principles of sickness benefits in international social security

standards

The following ILO social security standards provide essential guidance on sickness benefits: the Income
Security Recommendation, 1944 (No. 67); the Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952
(No. 102); the Medical Care and Sickness Benefits Convention, 1969 (No. 130); and the Medical Care and
Sickness Benefits Recommendation, 1969 (No. 134). These instruments reflect an international consensus
on the following principles.
X Scope: Sickness benefits are provided in case of “incapacity for work resulting from a morbid condition

and involving suspension of earnings” (C.102, Art. 14, and C.130, Art. 7(b)). They should be granted
until recovery, including in the case of seeking preventive or curative care and being “isolated for the
purpose of quarantine” (R.134, Para. 8(a) and (b)).

X Coverage for all through public measures: Sickness benefits should be organized in the most

efficient way (R.202, Para. 9) to guarantee access to benefits for all.

X Solidarity in financing: The cost of sickness benefits and their administration should be borne

collectively by way of social insurance contributions, taxation or both in a manner which avoids
hardship to people of small means, ensuring that they can maintain their families in health and
decency, and takes into account national economic situations (C.102, Arts 67 and 71; see also R.202,
Para. 3(h), and R.67, Annex, Para. 26(8)).

X Waiting periods to access sickness benefits, if any, should not exceed three days (C.102, Art. 18; C.130,

Art. 26.3).

X Benefit level: Sickness benefits shall be paid periodically, providing at least 45 or 60 per cent of past

earnings (C.102, Arts 16 and 67, and C.130, Art. 22, respectively).

X Care for dependants: Appropriate provision should be made to help economically active people who

have “to care for a sick dependant” (R.134, Para. 10).

X

Definition and legal basis

Sickness benefits aim at ensuring income
security during sickness, quarantine or sickness
of a dependent relative. As such, they are a
social protection instrument with a public health
objective. Sickness benefits allow recipients to stay
at home until they are fully recovered, thereby
protecting their own health and, in the case of
communicable diseases, the health of others.
Sickness benefits contribute to the human rights
to health and to social security (ILO 2017f), and are
more important than ever when both individuals
and societies are facing adverse health events.
The COV ID ‑19 crisis put sickness benef it
coverage gaps in the spotlight, illustrating how
they compelled people to work when sick or
quarantined, increasing the contagion risk (ILO
2020s). The consequent negative impact on
disease prevention has long been documented,
both in previous public health crises such as severe

acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Drago 2010) and in
the literature on occupational safety and health in
the workplace (James 2019).
The ILO adopted the first Convention on sickness
benefits in 1927; this was subsequently updated
by further standards (see box 4.9) (ILO 2020x).
Sickness benefits should not be confused with
sick leave; box 4.10 provides some conceptual
clarification. Although income security during
sickness is included in the Social Protection
Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), sickness
benefits are not reflected in the SDGs. Despite
its importance as a socio-economic determinant
of health, income security during illness is not
mentioned in either SDG target 1.3 on social
protection or SDG target 3.8 on universal health
coverage. Income security in times of ill health
has limited visibility within the SDGs and is underresearched, especially in low- and middle-income
countries (Lönnroth et al. 2020; Thorpe 2019).

121

122 X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

X Box 4.10 Sick leave and sickness benefits: Definitions
Sick leave addresses the need for a person to take leave when sick and should be defined in labour law.
The right to take sick leave is recognized as an entitlement separated from other types of leave, such
as holidays, in both the Holidays with Pay Recommendation, 1954 (No. 98), and the Holidays with Pay
Convention (Revised), 1970 (No. 132). Sick leave entitlements should be reflected in contracts and should
provide equality of treatment across several categories of workers, in particular for temporary and other
types of vulnerable employment (ILO 2011a, 2019a). Each country may define instances in which there is
a suspension of earnings during sick leave, and may also define a period, if any, during which there is a
legal obligation for employers to cover the salary of workers (employers’ liability).
Sickness benefits guarantee that an adequate income is provided during sick leave when earnings are
suspended. To maximize the impact of sickness benefit schemes, social security standards provide
guidance for their design features and financing structure (see box 4.9). Sickness benefits should be
provided in the most effective and efficient way based on broad risk-pooling and solidarity, for example
through universal benefit schemes, national social insurance schemes, social assistance schemes or some
combination of these. The cost of such benefits and their administration should be borne collectively, not
by the employer or worker alone.

X

Legal and effective coverage

Legal coverage
The ILO estimates that 62 per cent of the global
labour force, representing 39 per cent of the
working-age population, is legally entitled to
some income security via paid sick leave through
an employer’s liability, sickness benefits (provided
by social insurance or assistance) or a combination
of both mechanisms. This leaves nearly four in ten
workers without legal coverage (see figure 4.13).
There are wide regional differences, with high
levels of legal coverage in Europe and Central Asia
and the Arab States, and lower levels in Africa and
Asia and the Pacific.
Although legal protection can be provided by
employers’ liability, sickness benefits offer a more
robust way to provide income security in case of
ill health. Reliance solely on employers’ liability
may have adverse effects. Coverage is limited,
by definition, to salaried work only (the selfemployed being their own employers), and often
also excludes specific categories of employees,
such as casual workers and workers who are paid
hourly wages. Solidarity in financing is also limited
as individual enterprises are left to bear the costs

10

of workers’ sickness. This may lead to pressure on
workers not to take sick leave and to discrimination
in recruitment against individuals with declared
medical conditions. Small enterprises in particular
may struggle with the financial implications, and
therefore have an incentive to employ workers
in forms of employment that are not subject to
statutory sick leave (ILO 2020r).
Most countries have legal provisions for paid sick
leave through employer’s liability or for sickness
benefits, or a combination of both, for at least
one category of workers (see figure 4.14). Yet
59 countries rely exclusively on employer’s liability
to compensate for the loss of income during
sickness, and only one third of African countries
have legal provisions for
sickness benefits. Also, existing
provisions may exclude some
categories of workers, and
Only one third of
special efforts are needed to
extend protection, including
African countries
to workers in part-time and
have legal
temporary employment, the
provisions for
self-employed and jobseekers
sickness benefits.
(ILO 2021h).10

Unemployment benefits should not be used in cases of sickness; instead, sickness benefit should be guaranteed.

Several countries have expanded sickness benefits in an attempt to curb the spread and impact of

income families not covered by other schemes, were made eligible to receive lump-sum benefit

de Salud y Protección Social 2020);

X in El Salvador, the Government mandated the official social security institution, the Instituto Salvadoreño

quarantine, without a waiting period and regardless of whether or not they fell ill (El Mundo 2020);

X in Japan, cash sickness benefits were extended to those in quarantine or diagnosed with COVID‑19,

while simultaneously requirements to obtain medical certificates were waived (ISSA 2020).

Adequacy of benefits

Effective coverage

X

Even if workers are legally covered for sickness
benefits, they will only be effectively covered
once they are affiliated to a scheme, understand
how to access benefits and actually receive their
benefits when they fall ill. While income security in
case of ill health should be monitored under SDG
target 1.3, a lack of comprehensive and systematic
data collection on the different aspects of effective
coverage has led to this dimension currently being
excluded from SDG monitoring efforts (Lönnroth
et al. 2020).

Benefit adequacy depends on the level of income
replacement, the duration of payments, and the
existence and length of a waiting period. When
benefit levels are calculated as a percentage of
past earnings, the existence of a guaranteed
minimum level is essential for low-income
workers (ILO 2021c, 253). Out of 94 countries for
which information is available on social insurance
schemes providing sickness benefits, 27 countries
have provisions for income replacement lower
than 60 per cent of past earnings, while an
additional six countries offer flat-rate benefits.

Many countries have introduced measures via both
contributory and non-contributory programmes,
such as Brazil, Malawi, Malaysia (see box 4.12),
Peru, South Africa, Viet Nam and Zambia. Even so,
universal effective coverage remains concentrated
in the European region, where broad risk-pooling
and solidarity in financing are the basis of longestablished systems (as in Finland; see box 4.13)
(Thorpe 2019). Obstacles to effective coverage can
include administrative or geographical barriers,
non-compliance with registration procedures or
lack of awareness (Scheil-Adlung and Bonnet 2011;
ILO 2014c, 2017f).

Benefit duration is also important, as people
affected by long-term illnesses are in critical need
of income and may lose their jobs if there is no
or insufficient sickness benefit provision. Indeed,
with no sickness benefit in place, employers may
not be able to afford to retain workers who are
unable to work for extended periods of time. With
a view to covering such cases, some countries have
created specific benefits for long-term diseases,
or have even integrated chronic diseases into the
eligibility criteria for disability benefit schemes
(see box 4.14). Among the 94 countries for which
information is available, 33 provide benefits for a
maximum duration not exceeding 26 weeks.

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

X Box 4.12 Introduction of sickness benefit in Malaysia
With a view to improving financial protection against ill health, in 2019 the Malaysian Government
launched a sickness cash benefit programme to complement the national healthcare service in cases
of critical illness and/or hospitalization. The MySalam national health protection scheme aims to cover
3.69 million citizens and permanent residents of working age and their spouses with income support in
cases of selected illnesses. This total represents about 10 per cent of the total population, a little less than
a quarter of the labour force. MySalam covers people included in the Bantuan Sara Hidup (BSH) register,1
and people aged 18–65 years who are not in the BSH register, with an annual income of up to US$23,000
per year (MySalam 2020).
The scheme focuses on covering costs associated with hospitalization not otherwise covered and
providing some income replacement during hospitalization. The benefit is means-tested and provides
a lump sum upon diagnosis of one of 45 critical illnesses and daily hospitalization income replacement
up to US$161 per year at any public hospital (MySalam 2020). A broader reform would allow for the
expansion of both the population covered and the adequacy of the benefit to reach beyond cases
of hospitalization.
The BSH register was established by the Government in 2019 to help reduce the cost of living for people on low
incomes (the group defined as B40) (Bantuan Prihatin Nasional, 2020). It includes the following categories of those
eligible for benefits under MySalam: (1) individuals aged 18–65 years with spouses; (2) single individuals aged
40–65 years with an income of less than 24,000 Malaysian ringgit (US$5,500) per year; and (3) disabled individuals
aged 18–65 years with an income of less than 24,000 ringgit (US$5,500) per year.

X Box 4.13 Sickness benefit for all in Finland
Finland has a national social insurance sickness benefit scheme which covers all non-retired residents
aged 16–67 years (employees, self-employed, students, unemployed jobseekers and those on sabbatical
or alternation leave1) as well as non-residents who have worked in the country for at least four months.
The scheme is financed through employer and employee contributions as well as by the State, ensuring
solidarity between those who can work and those who cannot. The benefits are either a proportion of
previous earnings or a minimum allowance, depending on the recipient’s employment status. In 2007, the
country introduced the possibility of combining part-time sick leave and part-time work, with a view to
allowing people with long-term conditions, such as mental illnesses, to stay connected with the workplace
even when they are not able to work on a full-time basis (Kausto et al. 2014).
This is an arrangement whereby an employee takes a period of leave, and an unemployed person fills the vacant
position. The employee receives an unemployment benefit for the leave period, which must be between 100 and
360 calendar days.

1

Finally, in some countries sickness benefits may
cover only periods of sickness, sometimes with
a waiting period,11 and not time spent seeking
care, in quarantine or self-isolation, or caring for
dependants. Sickness benefits should cover those
undergoing preventive care or isolating for the
purpose of quarantine, in line with ILO standards
and as widely observed during the COVID‑19
pandemic (see box 4.11). Provision should also be
made available for economically active people who
have to care for sick dependants (see box 4.15).

X

The case for universal sickness
benefits

Where sickness benefits are not available, both
the health and the income security of workers
and their families, as well as public health, are
at risk. In this respect, valuable lessons can be
learned from impact studies of long-lasting and
chronic diseases.

If they exist, such waiting periods should not exceed three days (see box 4.9).

X Box 4.14 Efforts to support income security for people

affected by TB and HIV: Achievements and limitations

Considering the needs of HIV and TB patients facing income loss and additional non-medical expenses,
in the absence of sickness benefit schemes, governments have been prompted to take action in many
countries where these conditions impose a heavy burden. Such actions have included the following.
X Disease-specific schemes. For example, a conditional cash transfer was made available to people living

with drug-resistant TB in Ecuador (Cazares 2012). The programme was funded through Ecuador’s
National Tuberculosis Programme and provided cash benefits linked to adherence to treatment for
up to 24 months (Presidencia de la Republica de Ecuador 2012). Currently, caregivers of children with
severe illnesses and people living with HIV are also eligible under Executive Decree No. 804 of 2019.
The limited evidence available warrants caution about disease-specific programmes, given the risk of
exacerbating stigma and discrimination.

X Granting access to disability benefits that were already in place. For example, South Africa provides

a disability grant for people living with HIV, if the disease limits their activity and if the CD4 count is
below a certain threshold.1 This is the only non-contributory scheme that provides free healthcare
and income security in the event of loss of working capacity owing to HIV infection for South Africans.
While it provides a solution for a number of people living with HIV, it does not meet the needs of those
with diseases that are less visible to policymakers (with a lower national burden).

X Granting households with at least one member living with HIV and/or TB access to social assistance

programmes. For example, in Botswana, the Orphan Care Program Short Term Plan of Action on Care
Orphans, a cash transfer for households caring for an orphan, is available to children living with HIV.
It offers children and their caregivers assistance with educational needs, free medical treatment in
government health facilities, a transportation allowance and other income support assistance. While
this has provided relief to children living with HIV and their caregivers, it does not offer income security
while the family copes with a sick breadwinner.

1

CD4 cell count is an indicator of immune function in people living with HIV.

X Box 4.15 Benefit to care for sick dependants
In Portugal, the scheme Subsídio para Assistência a Filho ensures that workers receive 65 per cent of their
average daily earnings for up to 30 days a year if they need to take care of a sick child aged under 12, and
15 days a year to take care of sick children aged 12–18 in need of care and living in the same household.
The benefit duration is extended to six months for children with disabilities or chronic illness, regardless
of age, as long as they are dependent and living at home. The benefit may be extended for up to four
years (ISSA and SSA 2018; ILO 2020r).
Such an example of expanded sickness benefit echoes the recommendations provided by the Medical
Care and Sickness Benefits Recommendation, 1969 (No. 134). The benefit is available to fathers
and mothers alike, recognizing the importance of sharing the burden of care, which tends to fall
disproportionately on women (ILO 2018a).

Addressing the non-medical costs of illness
Non-medical costs,12 including income loss,
increase the risk of poverty for sick people and their
families. The impoverishment risks are even greater
when healthcare benefits are not guaranteed and
12

the cost of healthcare services must be borne
out of pocket (see section 4.4). In such cases,
the compounded impact of illness on household
health, income and well-being is immediate and
may have a lasting effect (ILO 2020r).

Costs that patients face due to their medical condition are typically classified as: (1) direct medical costs that occur within
the health system (e.g. cost of drugs or fees of healthcare staff); (2) direct non-medical costs, that is, care-related costs
that patients incur outside the health system (e.g. the cost of transportation to and from health facilities or increased food
spending owing to a treatment-related change in diet); and (3) indirect costs, namely the opportunity cost of seeking care or
being sick, notably the income loss caused by lost working time.

The impoverishing impact of sickness arising
from income loss and direct non-medical costs
is increasingly documented (WHO, 2018a). The
global TB and HIV/AIDS strategies have included
an income security component, and social
protection access is monitored (WHO 2014;
UNAIDS 2015; Lönnroth et al. 2014). For those
diseases, while affordable or free healthcare
services have been scaled up, the importance
of other costs, such as productivity or job loss,
is also increasingly recognized (Lönnroth et al.
2020, 2014). For instance, the national TB patient
cost surveys coordinated by the WHO show that
patients face not only varying levels of direct
medical costs, depending on the country context,
but also significant direct non-medical costs
(mostly transport and nutrition) and income loss,
creating incentives to forgo care (see figure 4.15).

Reaching universality
A number of countries with a high TB and HIV
burden have tried to expand coverage in the
absence of universal sickness benefits through
disease-specific programmes and other initiatives,
as illustrated in box 4.14. While this effort is
laudable, early evidence indicates that income

X Extending the coverage of employment injury protection for work-

related injuries and occupational disease contributes to achieving
SDG target 1.3. Effective coverage of workers by employment
injury insurance (EII) is still low worldwide at 35.4 per cent, and
significantly lower in most low- and middle-income countries,
owing to labour market structures and weak enforcement of
schemes where they do exist.

X Thirty-six countries, most of them in Africa or in Asia and the

Pacific, still depend on direct compensation by employers in the
event of injuries at work, and lack any kind of EII system. However,
a growing number of countries are adopting and implementing
EII systems following social security principles as specified in ILO
Conventions Nos 102 and 121 (see box 4.16). This will improve
effective coverage, in particular in hazardous occupations and
in small and medium-sized enterprises, and enhance protection
levels.

X The COVID‑19 pandemic has rendered the importance of EII

schemes self-evident, as these schemes protect workers and their
families against the consequences of exposure to new diseases
emerging in the workplace.

X The cost of employment injury benefits and of safety and health at

work, including prevention of injury or disease and rehabilitation
of injured workers, is part of the overall cost of production and
contributes to preventing injured workers, and the families of
deceased workers, from falling into poverty.

X Safety and health at work can benefit from policy synergies with

employment injury benefits for all workers.

X Adequate employment injury benefits take the form of periodic

payments, with cost-of-living adjustments for long-term benefits,
for example in cases of permanent disability and for survivors’
benefits.

X The challenge of extending employment injury protection to

workers in the informal economy remains of high importance.

Protecting workers in the event
of work-related injuries
and diseases

Every day, people die as a result of occupational
accidents or work-related diseases; these factors
account for more than 2.78 million deaths per year.
There are also some 374 million non-fatal workrelated injuries each year that result in more than
four days of absence from work. The human cost
in terms of avoidable death and impairment is
vast. The economic burden of poor occupational
safety and health practices is estimated at 3.94 per
cent of global GDP each year (ILO 2021l).
Employment injury schemes, providing benefits in
cash and in kind in cases of work-related accidents
and diseases, were established to address one
of the key challenges in modern workplaces.
Employers are responsible for securing the
occupational safety and health of their workers,
and for providing fair, equitable and effective
compensation to injured workers and families
of deceased workers. Where employment injury
schemes are not in place, the only hope of redress
for injured workers or their survivors lies in
direct compensation paid by their employer or
in a lawsuit against the employer in the courts.
Lawsuits are usually lengthy, expensive and
stressful for victims, and so are resorted to only
rarely; and compensation is often not paid.
In many countries where the financial responsibility
for compensation rests on employers, they often
take out private insurance. However, the outcomes
of these schemes are often suboptimal. The
processing of an insurance claim involves the
need to obtain relevant information and requires
the injured person to undergo rigorous medical
assessments, causing them substantial delays
in obtaining healthcare and other benefits. In
addition, an employer may be reluctant to make
a claim for fear of other legal implications and the
cost of compensation. Also, since the employer
may not continue in business and a private insurer
may be reluctant to provide benefits for a long
period of time, benefits are usually disbursed in
the form of a lump sum, or periodic payments for
a short period without adjustment in line with the
cost of living. In recognition of these drawbacks,
many countries have replaced the employers’
liability system with social insurance.

In addressing work-related injuries and disease,
the social insurance system adopts the following
principles:
X “no fault ”: that is, an injured worker or

survivor(s) of a deceased worker should qualify
for benefits without the necessity to prove
“fault” on the part of the employer;

X collective sharing of liability among employers,

so that employers collectively finance the
scheme, allowing for risk-pooling among them;
and

X neutral governance of administration of

the scheme: that is, the right to benefit is
established outside the contractual relationship
between a worker and their employer.

Employment injury benefits in most countries
consist of:
X medical and allied care for injured workers; and
X earnings-related periodic cash benefits to

disabled workers, or to survivors of deceased
workers, including funeral grants.

Many national employment injury schemes also
have a set of wider objectives, such as rehabilitation
and re-employment of injured or sick workers,
and the promotion and maintenance of safety and
health at the workplace. These objectives can be
achieved only in the context of an integrated
framework for comprehensive occupational
safety and health measures, strong inspection and
enforcement measures, and adequate cash and
healthcare benefits, accompanied by appropriate
physical and vocational rehabilitation services.
A rating system, according to which levels
of contribution are calculated to reflect the
past performance of employers in respect of
employment injuries, provides employers with an
incentive to prevent workplace injuries as well as
facilitating the return to work of injured workers.
For such a scheme to work effectively, there must
be a strong inspection mechanism, since a rating
system also provides employers with an incentive
to hide accidents. In consequence it is mainly highincome countries that adopt this system.
Financially sustainable and administratively
efficient employment injury schemes are a
step towards preventing injured workers and
families of injured and deceased workers from
falling into poverty and thereby contribute to the
achievement of SDG 1, to “end poverty in all its
forms everywhere”.

132 X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

X Box 4.16 International standards relevant to employment injury protection
The right to protection against employment injury is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (UDHR), 1948, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR),
1966.1
According to ILO Convention No. 102 (Part VI), any condition that has a negative impact on health
and is attributable to a work accident or an occupational disease, and the incapacity to work and earn
that results from it, must be covered. Accordingly, the provision must include medical and allied care
free of charge, and cash benefits for the injured person or their dependants. The Employment Injury
Benefits Convention (No. 121) and Recommendation (No. 121), 1964, set higher standards and recognize
the importance of an integrated approach in improving working conditions, limiting the impact of
employment injuries, and facilitating the reintegration of people with disabilities into the labour market
and into society (for more details on the minimum requirements, see Annex 3).
The approach taken by Recommendation No. 202 is different, reflecting its focus on preventing or
alleviating poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion through income security guarantees and access to
at least essential healthcare for all in need, irrespective of the origin of the disability or ill health giving
rise to the need for income security and care. Basic income security and access to essential healthcare
can be ensured through a variety of approaches, combining contributory and non-contributory
schemes and different types of benefits. Particularly relevant to employment injury protection is the
Recommendation’s further call for the combining of preventive, promotional and active measures with
benefits and social services, and the coordination of social protection policies with policies that promote,
among other things, secure work within a decent work framework.

Types of employment injury
protection schemes and legal
coverage

The majority of countries adopt a social insurance
approach, although some countries retain
elements of an employers’ liability approach
so that workers who are not covered by social
insurance schemes are compensated directly
by employers.
Figures 4.16 and 4.17 illustrate the patterns of
legal coverage worldwide. As figure 4.16 shows,
the emphasis on social insurance, as opposed to
employers’ liability, is higher in Europe, Central
Asia and the Arab States, and lower in the
Americas, Africa, and Asia and the Pacific. In Asia
and the Pacific, an employers’ liability system
is still in place in countries such as Bangladesh,
Brunei Darussalam, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Legal
coverage levels show considerable gaps, especially
in Africa and in Asia and the Pacific. Legal coverage
of women is lower than that of men in some
parts of the world, especially in Africa where the
gender gap is particularly prominent. A number

of countries are exploring how to extend
coverage to self-employed workers, although
setting up specific alternatives for such groups
presents challenges.
In Africa, employer liability provisions are still in
place in countries including Botswana, Eswatini,
the Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Morocco,
Sierra Leone and Uganda. However, some of these
countries, such as Kenya and Malawi, are making
efforts to implement a social insurance mechanism
for providing employment injury benefits. In
Africa, voluntary legal coverage – whereby
employers can choose to compensate employees
directly or to buy private insurance – represents
a high proportion of the total legal coverage.
Undesirable consequences of voluntary coverage
(such as moral hazard), employers choosing not
to compensate directly and failure of private
insurers to cover high-risk sectors, could affect
the cost of the scheme. In order to minimize
these consequences, compulsory coverage for
the majority of workers and voluntary coverage
for limited categories of workers should
be considered.

Effective coverage

Despite efforts to extend coverage, in many
low- and middle-income countries the number
of workers effectively registered in employment
injury schemes is much smaller than those covered
by law (figures 4.18 and 4.19). The low effective
coverage in some parts of the world stems from
substantial informality, labour and social security
inspection mechanisms with low enforcement
capacity, low contributory capacity on the part
of employers, a lack of understanding of social
insurance, a mismatch between benefits and
needs, and complex administrative procedures.
Effective coverage figures show that 35.4 per
cent of workers globally receive benefits in the
event of employment injury. There are significant
regional disparities, however: while 75.5 per
cent of workers in Europe and Central Asia, and
63.5 per cent and 57.4 per cent in the Arab States
and Americas, respectively, receive benefits, this
is the case for only 24.8 per cent of workers in Asia
and the Pacific and 18.4 per cent in Africa.
Despite low effective coverage in Asia and the
Pacific and in Africa, new EII schemes are gradually

13

being introduced. For example, the United
Republic of Tanzania has recently introduced an
EII scheme, which in 2018 effectively covered
around 5 per cent of the labour force (ILO 2019h).
Cambodia’s EII was first launched in November
2008 to provide coverage for employees in
private-sector companies employing eight or
more workers. Coverage has grown from an initial
327 enterprises in 2008 to 12,513 enterprises and
1.63 million workers, of whom 56.2 per cent are
women, in 2018 (Ham, Sopheara, and Sereyrarth
2019), a total estimated at 18 per cent of the
labour force.13
While numbers of work-related
injuries and diseases are
measured or estimated in many
countries, there are no statistics
to monitor the proportion of
injured wor ker s e f fec ti vel y
compensated. This lacuna in
data collection requires urgent
attention, especially in view of
SDG indicator 1.3.1 calling for the
coverage of employed workers in
case of employment injury.

In many countries
there are no
statistics to monitor
the proportion of
injured workers
effectively
compensated.

Adequacy of benefits

Cash benefits of EII schemes are usually disbursed
in the form of periodic payments, with costof-living adjustments for long-term benefits
such as permanent disability and survivors’
benefits. Replacement rates, defined as benefits
as a percentage of earnings before injur y,
differ considerably, as shown in figure 4.20. It
is encouraging that, in Thailand, the worker
compensation law was amended in 2018 to
increase the benefits paid by the Social Security
Office from 60 per cent to 70 per cent of monthly
wages (ISSA 2018).
The interpretation of replacement rates as set out
in national legislation requires careful attention.

Certain technical aspects of schemes, which may
not be explicitly expressed in the legislation,
may lead to the substantial erosion of benefits.
One example is the ceiling placed on wages to
limit insurable earnings, that is, earnings subject
to calculations of contributions and benefits.
A ceiling that is too infrequently adjusted and
therefore becomes too low leads to low benefits
and contributions, as seen in the Sindh Province of
Pakistan and in Zambia. This led to the provision
of top-ups on benefits in the case of the Baldia
factory fire of 2012 in Sindh Province, and efforts
to substantially raise the ceiling in Zambia.
Another example is the exclusion from total
insurable earnings of certain benefits that the
worker receives as part of job remuneration, which
also leads to lower benefits and contributions.

Recent developments: Extending
employment injury insurance

Employers’ liability schemes contain minimal
provisions for benefits and services. Workers
in small- and medium-sized enterprises are in a
particularly vulnerable position: they are the most
prone to injuries, given the limited resources that
most of these enterprises allocate to prevention
and the high staff turnover that discourages
employers from investing in training their workers
in preventing accidents and injuries.
For this reason, a number of developing countries
are keen to establish an EII scheme or have
recently introduced one. For example, in the United
Republic of Tanzania, the Workers Compensation
Fund was established on 1 July 2015 and is following

14

a medium-term plan to revise contribution rates
according to risk assessments of workplaces and
other relevant factors. Countries in Eastern and
South-Eastern Asia, including Japan, Malaysia, the
Philippines, the Republic of Korea and Thailand,
have a long history of implementing these
schemes and gradually expanding coverage
in cases of employment injury. For example,
Malaysia recently introduced the Self-Employment
Social Security Scheme. In its initial stage, this
scheme is compulsory for the self-employed
in the passenger transportation sector, which
covers taxi drivers (including taxis booked online)
and bus drivers under the provisions of the SelfEmployment Social Security Act, 2017. With effect
from 1 January 2020, the scheme was extended
to 19 other sectors.14 Some countries in Southern
Asia, including India and Pakistan, have provincial

X Box 4.17 Compensation for workers infected by COVID‑19 while at work
Before the COVID‑19 pandemic, EII or worker compensation schemes did not usually provide
compensation for infectious diseases, owing to the difficulty of determining whether an infection is
work-related or not. However, international labour standards stipulate that, if contracted because of
work, contracting an infectious disease such as COVID‑19 could be considered an employment injury.
Employment injuries, under the scope of the Employment Injury Benefits Convention, 1964 (No. 121),
and the Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), include industrial accidents
and occupational diseases. In the specific circumstances of COVID‑19, nearly 50 countries have provided
compensation for workers infected by the virus. Some countries (such as Italy and Spain) regard these
cases as work-related injuries, while others (such as Belgium, the Republic of Korea, South Africa and the
United Kingdom) regard them as cases of occupational disease. Some countries (such as Germany) have
provisions for both.
Many countries extend coverage to COVID‑19 cases, at least for selected categories of workers, with
relaxed conditions of proof of work-related incidence. Workers whose employment activities include
engagement or interaction with people who may have contracted the virus are at a greater risk of
contracting the virus themselves. In those cases, the workplace is judged to be the place of infection.
For example, in Belgium, some categories of workers in the healthcare sector who are at significantly
increased risk of being infected by the virus are eligible for compensation when diagnosed with COVID‑19
by a laboratory test. However, in many countries claims are treated on a case-by-case basis.
Determining the onset of an occupational disease such as COVID‑19 is a complex issue, owing to the
latency period. This issue poses a challenge in claiming compensation in many countries with high
levels of COVID‑19 infection. In consequence, many countries have relaxed the proof, and therefore the
eligibility, requirements for certain categories of workers in respect of demonstrating that a COVID‑19
infection occurred in the workplace, and consequently should be treated as a work-related accident or
disease. This has made it easier for workers not only to gain rapid access to benefits, but also to selfisolate and thereby avoid further workplace transmission. The abuse of such schemes can be avoided
through proper administrative and financial governance. This contributes to maintaining fairness in
respect of compensation for other work-related injuries and diseases, and ensures the system’s longterm financial sustainability.
Source: ILO (2021n).

EII schemes in place, but the coverage is still
limited, given these countries’ labour market
structure and employment practices that often
lead to under-reporting or lack of compliance in
registering workers.
In the context of the COVID‑19 pandemic, many
EII schemes have reviewed their administrative
rules in order to provide fast and effective
compensation to workers infected by the virus
while at work. Box 4.17 gives some examples of
national practice in this area.
In many countries, essential workers who
run a high risk of exposure to COVID‑19 have
been compensated by an element of “hazard
pay”. However, more could have been done to
compensate essential workers in this respect.
In the absence of consistent and equitable pay
policies and greater protections for worker

safety, essential workers are likely to experience
burnout and employers are likely to suffer high
staff turnover, and together these eventualities
may reduce the availability of greatly needed care
services (Dorn et al. forthcoming). Furthermore,
this context requires that employment injury
provisions adequately address the additional
burden of occupational mental ill health arising
from stress as a result of long working hours,
heavier workloads, continuous exposure to
COVID‑19 infection risk and insufficient time
for rest and recuperation. The recognition of
employment injury caused by mental stress,
which is rampant in care-related occupations
typically performed by women, raises a broader
issue that goes beyond the COVID‑19 pandemic
about defining employment injury in a way that is
relevant to the service-dominated labour markets
of the twenty-first century.

X Box 4.18 Malaysia: Coverage of migrant workers
Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak ratified the Equality of Treatment (Accident Compensation) Convention,
1925 (No. 19), in 1957 and 1964, respectively.
However, in 1993, foreign workers employed in Malaysia were transferred from the Employees’ Social
Security Scheme (E) to the Foreign Workers’ Compensation Scheme (FWCS), mainly owing to difficulties
in administering the provision of benefits to foreign workers and their families in their home countries.
The benefits provided under the FWCS were significantly lower than those provided under the E, leading
to a divergence of national law and practice from the provisions of the Convention, which establishes
the principle of equality of treatment between foreign workers and national workers without condition
of residence.
As of 1 January 2019, foreign workers’ protection in relation to work-related injuries and diseases was
moved back from the FWCS under the Workmen’s Compensation (Foreign Workers’ Compensation
Scheme) (Insurance) Order, 2005, to the E, now administered under the Employees’ Social Security
Act (ESSA). Except for specific exclusions mentioned in its first schedule, the ESSA does not make any
distinction between national and non-national workers as to their coverage by and entitlement to workrelated injury benefits (ILO 2019c).

Migrant workers form a group that is particularly
vulnerable to discrimination. The incidence of
informal employment is high among migrant
workers worldwide, as they are concentrated in
low-skill, temporary, seasonal and casual work.
They are often excluded from social security
coverage, owing to restrictive legislation and
a lack of enforcement, even though the type
of work they typically engage in often carries a
higher risk of accidents. When migrant workers
are included in social security coverage, they often
receive lower benefits than national workers.
Box 4.18 describes the progress made in Malaysia

to provide migrant workers with the same benefits
as national workers.
A coherent national strategy to facilitate
transitions to formality, not only for migrant
workers but for all informal workers, needs to
recognize that the costs of working informally
and remaining unprotected from employment
injury, as for all social security contingencies, are
high for businesses, workers, the community and
the global economy. Ensuring employment injury
protection for vulnerable groups would help to
achieve the indicators of SDG target 1.3.

X People with disabilities have been disproportionately affected

by COVID‑19, and numerous countries have made efforts to
give them better protection during the current health and socioeconomic crisis. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to ensure
that these individuals are not left behind: measures directed at
people with disabilities accounted for a mere 8.5 per cent of all
measures announced.

X The latest ILO estimates of effective coverage show that only

33.5 per cent of people with severe disabilities worldwide receive
a disability benefit, with large regional variation: while coverage
in Eastern Europe appears to be almost universal, estimates for
Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa show an effective coverage
rate of below 7 per cent. Coverage in high-income countries is
85.6 per cent, compared with 11.3 per cent in lower-middle-income
countries and 8.6 per cent in low-income countries.

X Disability-inclusive social protection systems guarantee effective

access to healthcare and income security, including coverage of
disability-related costs, for all people with disabilities. They usually
comprise a combination of general and disability-specific schemes,
both cash and in-kind, designed in ways that enable people with
disabilities to participate actively in education, employment and
society.

X Including questions related to disability in the collection

of administrative data and household surveys, with data
disaggregated by disability status, is crucially important to
facilitate the effective monitoring of social protection systems,
which in turn contributes both to the development of evidencebased policies and to the achievement of the SDGs.

4.2.5 Disability benefits and disability-inclusive
social protection

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

Protecting and supporting people
with disabilities to ensure economic
and social inclusion, income
security and independent living

protection responses in 2020 referred to people
with disabilities at all, and measures specifically
directed at this group accounted for a mere
8.5 per cent of all measures announced (UNPRPD
and ILO 2021).

People with disabilities face multiple risks
throughout their lives.15 As a result of various
factors, such as stigma, lack of support and certain
institutionalized care practices, children with
disabilities are at higher risk of violence, exclusion
from education and being placed in institutions,
which hampers their ability to participate in
social, economic and cultural life, including skilled
employment later in life (UN Women 2017; UNICEF
2013). Across countries with different income
levels, people of working age with disabilities are
less likely to be employed, especially in the formal
economy (UN 2012b), and therefore less able
to rely on stable and adequate earnings or on
access to contributory social protection schemes.
The prevalence of disabilities increases with age,
resulting in a high proportion of older people with
disabilities, particularly in the age group 55 years
and above, with little to no support to tackle
disability-related needs (WHO and World Bank
2011). This risk of functional limitations in old age
is larger for lower-income groups (WHO 2015). All
these factors contribute to people with disabilities
being at greater risk of poverty and deprivation
throughout the life cycle (Banks, Morgan, Kuper,
and Polack 2018; Mitra et al. 2017).

Access to mainstream social protection schemes,
as well as to disability-specific benefits, is of
central importance for people with disabilities in
ensuring their income security, covering disabilityrelated costs, and promoting employment
and participation in society. Social protection
facilitates access to basic services such as health,
education and public transport, as well as support
services including social work, childcare and the
provision of assistive devices. The provision of
such an holistic package corresponds with the
UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (CRPD), 2006, international social
security standards and the 2030 Agenda, as
expressed in particular in SDG targets 1.3 and 8.5
(ILO and IDA 2019; UN 2015c) (see box 4.19).16

The COVID‑19 crisis has revealed, and further
exacerbated, these pre-existing vulnerabilities,
par ticular l y for those w i th inter sec ting
vulnerabilities, such as women and girls with
disabilities (UNPRPD et al. 2020; UN 2020a). People
with disabilities were significantly affected by
disruptions of their usual support systems during
lockdown, along with confinement and high rates
of contagion because they rely more than others
on support services, personal assistants and
health services in their everyday lives. Ensuring
the continuity and extension of services catering
for the needs of people with disabilities has been
critically important. However, fewer than half of

as well as support services.
A diversit y of schemes,
complemented by a range of high-quality public
services, is necessary to address the range of
different needs across the life cycle (see table 4.2).

15

There is no single definition of disability. However, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2006,
recognizes that “disability is an evolving concept” (Preamble). “Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term
physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and
effective participation in society on an equal basis with others” (Art. 1).

16

The CRPD strongly reaffirms the right to social protection for people with disabilities and establishes a pathway for
their inclusion in all efforts related to the realization of this right (Art. 28). The 2030 Agenda explicitly refers to people
with disabilities with regard to social protection systems, including floors (SDG target 1.3), and with regard to their full

X Box 4.19 The international normative framework for the right

to social protection of people with disabilities

The international normative framework has progressively elaborated the right to social security of people
with disabilities and States’ obligations to secure this right in ways that foster access to socio-economic
participation on an equal basis with others.
The CRPD emphasizes the critical role of social protection in supporting the full and effective participation
and inclusion of people with disabilities across the life cycle. The CRPD sets out the obligations of States
parties to:
X ensure that people with disabilities enjoy adequate standards of living on an equal basis with

others, and have equal access to all social protection schemes and programmes, including pensions,
public housing (Art. 28), healthcare (Art. 25), rehabilitation (Art. 26), and vocational training and returnto-work programmes (Art. 27), without any discrimination;

X ensure that people with disabilities have access to assistance to cover disability-related expenses

as well as to affordable and quality disability-related services and devices (Art. 28) that they require
to live independently and be included in the community (Art. 19);

X support children with disabilities and their parents, prevent institutionalization and ensure that in

any case children are living in family-like settings (Arts 7, 16, 18 and 23);

X address the particular disadvantages faced by women and girls with disabilities (Arts 6 and 28);

and

X meaningfully consult and involve people with disabilities through their representatives’

organizations in the design, implementation and monitoring of social protection policies and
programmes (Art. 4.3).

International social security standards complement this framework. ILO Convention No. 102 (Part IX)
sets minimum standards for the provision of income security with respect to loss of income related
to acquiring a disability through employment injury or other causes. This is complemented by the
Employment Injury Benefits Convention, 1964 (No. 121), which stipulates the provision of additional
benefits for people requiring constant support by a third person. Furthermore, the Invalidity, Old-Age
and Survivors’ Benefits Convention, 1967 (No. 128), in Article 13(1), sets higher standards for disability
benefit schemes, including the provision of rehabilitation services to enable people with disabilities
either to resume their employment or to perform another activity suited to their aptitudes. Its
accompanying Recommendation, No. 131 (Para. 5), broadens the definition of the contingencies that
should be covered under national schemes by including partial disability, which should give rise to a
reduced benefit.
Although medical care, including medical rehabilitation, is dealt with under separate provisions in
Convention No. 102 (Part II), the Medical Care and Sickness Benefits Convention, 1969 (No. 130), expands
the provision of required medical care and rehabilitation, including access to assistive devices, that
should be “afforded with a view to maintaining, restoring or improving [their] health … and [their] ability
to work and to attend to [their] personal needs” (Art. 9).
ILO Recommendation No. 202 puts forward an integrated and comprehensive approach to social
protection, according to which people with disabilities should enjoy the same guarantees of basic
income security and access to essential healthcare as other members of society through national social
protection floors. In addition, the Recommendation requires that social protection systems be designed
in line with the principles of non-discrimination, gender equality and responsiveness to special needs, as
well as respect for the rights and dignity of people covered by the social security guarantees.

Focusing more specifically on disability cash
benefits, the large majority (175 countries) of the
188 countries for which information is available
have schemes providing periodic cash benefits
for people with disabilities anchored in national
legislation. The remaining countries either provide
lump sums only (11 countries) or have no scheme
anchored in law (two countries) (see figure 4.21).
Most countries (148) have social insurance
schemes; for a large number of countries (90) this
is the only mechanism through which they provide
social protection for people with disabilities. This
means that people with disabilities working
outside the formal economy, including children,
may face difficulties in meeting their disabilityspecific needs.
The overview also shows that 70 countries have
non-contributory schemes with (38) or without
(32) means-testing. However, the widespread
means-testing of disability benefits often does not
take into account disability-related costs or greater

17

difficulties in accessing the labour market. Fiftyeight countries combine both social insurance and
non-contributory schemes, of which 23 countries
have non-means-tested schemes in place.

X

Legal coverage

Just 33.8 per cent of all people with severe
disabilities around the world are legally covered
by mandatory contributory disability benefit
schemes,17 and another sixth (17.3 per cent) by
non-contributory disability benefit schemes (see
figure 4.22). Overall, women with disabilities are
less likely to be covered by contributory schemes
than men, largely reflecting their lower labour
force participation, particularly in Northern Africa
and the Arab States. In Europe and the Americas,
such gender gaps are partially compensated
for through the provision of non-contributory
benefits; however, these often provide lower
benefit levels.

While there is no universally accepted definition of severe disabilities, the coverage estimates presented in this report use
the definition adopted by WHO (see Annex 2).

Effective coverage: Monitoring
SDG indicator 1.3.1 for people
with severe disabilities

Worldwide, 33.5 per cent of people with severe
disabilities receive a disability benefit (see
figures 4.23 and 4.24). Coverage in Central Asia
is above 80 per cent and in Europe it is quasiuniversal; in Africa and the Arab States, however, it
is below 10 per cent. While universal provision for
people with disabilities is more common in higherincome countries, it has also been achieved in
Brazil, Chile, Mongolia and Uruguay. Significantly,
other countries, among them Kyrgyzstan, Nepal
and South Africa, are progressively extending
disability benefits. Conversely, several countries

X

undergoing fiscal consolidation after the financial
crisis of 2008–10, including Greece, Hungary,
Sweden and the United Kingdom, have cut
disability benefits, for instance by introducing
means tests for previously universal benefits
(Malli et al. 2018; UN 2019d). As countries move
out of the COVID‑19 crisis into recovery, there is a
risk that, under pressure to consolidate the public
finances, they will cut social protection expenditure
further, including benefits and support for people
with disabilities – despite the fact that expenditure
on disability benefits is already low in many
countries. Before the crisis, only a handful of lowand middle-income countries spent above 0.3 per
cent of GDP on provision in this area, as compared
with a European Union average of 2.8 per cent of
GDP in 2018 (Eurostat 2018; Kidd et al. 2019).

Social protection for people
with disabilities at the crossroads:
From “incapacity to work”
to “inclusion and empowerment”

Notwithstanding the paradigm change intended
by the CRPD and the emphasis on “leaving no one
behind” in the SDGs, existing social protection
policies in many countries are still largely framed
according to a paradigm that conceptualizes
disability as incapacity to work and associated
with poverty, rather than providing adequate
support to enable the participation and inclusion
of people with disabilities in society. In most lowand middle-income countries, the only available
disability benefits tend to be targeted on those
in poverty and/or conditional upon incapacity to
work. Segregating people with disabilities into
those “able” or “unable” to work, and making
disability benefits conditional upon incapacity to
work, locks people with disabilities into a vicious
cycle of dependency and exclusion, thereby
perpetuating existing stereotypes and prejudices.
Many high-income countries have reformed their
systems, adopting a more flexible approach that
provides benefits to offset disability-related costs

for those who are in work, supplemented by
income replacement for people with disabilities
who are not in a position to work. A few countries,
such as Fiji, Georgia, Mauritius, Namibia and
Thailand, among others, have universal disability
benefits in place that are compatible with work and
sometimes with other income support schemes.
These efforts are often accompanied by measures
to increase labour market accessibility for people
with disabilities. This is a first step towards greater
flexibility to support economic empowerment.
Taking the inclusion agenda seriously requires
designing and implementing social protection
systems with the following aspects in mind (ILO
and IDA 2019).

Participation of relevant stakeholders
Direct engagement with people with disabilities
through their representative bodies (organizations
of people with disabilities – OPDs) along the
full policy cycle of planning, implementing,
monitoring and reforming social protection
policies and programmes is not only a requirement
under Article 4.3 of the CRPD and Para. 3(r) of
Recommendation No. 202, but is also necessary to

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

ensure that policies are designed in such a way that
they reflect beneficiaries’ needs and are effective.
OPDs should in particular be involved in setting
priorities for social protection interventions in
a phased approach for progressively building
universal social protection (ILO and IDA 2019).
In Fiji, for example, the National Federation
of Persons with Disabilities has been closely
involved in the design of a disability allowance
supportive of economic empowerment and a
disability assessment and eligibility determination
mechanism that is easily accessible at community
level. This has contributed to strong ownership
and has facilitated the successful and rapid
roll-out of the programme (Pacific Disability Forum
2018). In Kenya, OPDs have been instrumental in
working with the Government to identify people
with disabilities quickly who could benefit from the
ad hoc cash transfer introduced in the context of
COVID‑19 (UNPRPD 2021).

Ensuring that disability data and statistics
include people with disabilities
Household surveys and tools used to collect
information for scheme administration need to
be disability-inclusive (Barca et al. 2021). Since
the adoption of the CRPD, the “Washington Group
Short Set” (WGSS) of questions has become the
standard tool for determining the prevalence of
disability (for example in household surveys).18
Allowing for data disaggregation, they also
provide insights into the inequalities faced by
people with disabilities and their level of access to
different services. In the Dominican Republic, the
inclusion of such questions in the SIUBEN (Sistema
Único de Beneficiarios) survey enabled families of
children with disabilities eligible for support to
be identified more rapidly during the COVID‑19
crisis. In addition to the WGSS, disability-specific
modules (ILO Model Labour Force Resources)19
and surveys (WHO Model Disability Survey),20 and
the SINTEF surveys,21 are needed to provide more
detailed information on the situations of people
with disabilities and the barriers they face.

Ensuring that disability assessments
provide for support and inclusion
Disabilit y assessments are carried out to
determine eligibility for individual disabilityrelated support. In many countries, assessments
still follow a medical model that is focused
solely only on a person’s impairments. Such
assessments may fail to provide insights into the
diverse barriers faced or support needs in terms
of devices and services, as recommended by the
CRPD committee. Furthermore, in many low- and
middle-income countries, medical assessments
are often not easily accessible owing to a lack of
qualified health professionals, severely restricting
the access of many people with disabilities to
disability-specific benefits. Some countries are
carrying out innovative assessments at the
community level with simple assessment tools
and the possibility of referrals to reduce the
costs to people with disabilities of accessing the
system (UNPRPD et al. 2021). For example in Viet
Nam, village committees have access to simple
assessment instruments to determine eligibility
of people with disabilities; a medical assessment
is needed only in the event of an appeal or when
the decision is not clear (Banks, Morgan, Walsham
et al. 2018). In order to implement disability
assessments effectively, good-quality assurance
and proper training of assessors are essential.
The COVID‑19 crisis has highlighted the importance
of inclusive social protection information systems,
including national disability registries, to channel
benefits to people with disabilities (as evidenced
in the example of the Dominican Republic). Such
registers should be based on disability assessment
and determination mechanisms that are easily
available nationwide and consider the diverse
barriers that people with disabilities face and their
support requirements (UNPRPD et al. 2021).

18

The aim of the WGSS of questions is to identify people who are at risk of having a disability in the social model sense: that
is, people who because of functional limitations can face restrictions on participation because of barriers they face in their
environment. The questions were kept to the minimum number needed to identify a large majority of people with disabilities
so that they would be practical for use in censuses and in the core demographic questions of household surveys. A growing
consensus has emerged across producers and users of disability data that the WGSS is the preferred methodology for
making international comparisons on disability prevalence and for disaggregating outcome indicators collected by censuses
and household surveys. For more details, see https://www.washingtongroup-disability.com.

Inclusive delivery mechanisms
In many countries, common barriers to accessing
social protection – such as physical distance, lack
of simple and appropriate information, lack of
financial inclusion, cumbersome and complex
administrative procedures – are magnified for
people with disabilities as a result of difficulties
in accessing transport, premises, online portals
and payment methods, as well as negative
attitudes. Awareness-raising of staff, disabilitydisaggregated data, non-discrimination and
accessibilit y provisions in regulations and
standard operating procedures all effectively
contribute to greater sensitization to disability
inclusion requirements. Such inputs are needed
throughout all steps along the delivery chain for
all social protection schemes and programmes,
whether disability-specific or mainstream, so as to
ensure effective access for and greater coverage
of people with disabilities (UNPRPD, ILO, and
UNICEF 2021).

Addressing disability-related costs
In order to provide adequate protection and
suppor t, design of benefits and eligibilit y
determination mechanisms need to take into
account the higher living costs of people with
disabilities in comparison with people without
disabilities (ILO and IDA 2019). These higher

costs mean that at the same level of income
people with disabilities will experience lower
living standards than people without disabilities.
Disability-related costs include higher daily costs
of living, for example higher health or transport
costs, and the costs of necessary support services
or assistive devices, personal assistance, sign
language and interpretation, and so on. They also
include indirect opportunity costs such as time
spent on support activities by family members or
lower earned income owing to barriers faced in
education and labour market opportunities. The
level and type of costs incurred depend on the
extent of each individual’s functional limitations
and support needs and the barriers in their
environment, as well as their level of participation
in social and economic life. Most people with
disabilities cannot afford the costs required to
achieve even basic participation. Some of these
costs can be reduced by lowering the barriers to
access, which can have a great impact but takes
time, while other costs are fixed.
While social protection can play a critical role in
covering these costs through a combination of
cash and in-kind transfers, the additional costs
are rarely factored into scheme design, or the
poverty threshold used in means-tested schemes,
and national poverty statistics are often not
adjusted to reflect additional costs (see box 4.20).
A few countries, such as the Republic of Moldova,

X Box 4.20 Measuring the additional cost of living for people with disabilities
If social protection systems are to provide adequate benefits to address disability-related costs, these
costs must be measured accurately. Different approaches to the task capture different realities. The
first approach uses household income and expenditure surveys to compare the standard of living of
otherwise similar households with and without people with disabilities. The difference in the standard
of living assessed provides an estimate of disability-related expenses, which often amount to between
30 and 50 per cent of average household incomes in higher-income countries (Mitra et al. 2017; Morris
and Zaidi 2020). It is important to note that these reflect actual expenditure, and may not be sufficient
to achieve full participation. Thus, estimates are usually lower in low- and middle-income countries, as
households have less capacity to pay and the availability of services needed is lower. Recent studies have
shown that the share of disability-related expenses relative to household incomes is significantly higher
in the lowest income quintile than in the second or third quintile. The share of disability-related costs
relative to incomes increases again in the highest quintile where households have greater capacity to
pay for expensive services and devices.
To complement estimates, some studies ask people with disabilities and their families about the disabilityrelated expenses they face. A study in South Africa shows that disability-related costs differ widely
depending on the type of disability, the level of support needs and economic status, ranging from below
the poverty line to 14 times the poverty line (South Africa 2016). Research from New Zealand showed
that the additional weekly costs for a single person with a disability living alone could represent up to
five times the minimum salary (Disability Resource Centre 2010).

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

have factored basic disability expenses faced by
households into the benefit-calculation formula
that determines the poverty assistance cash
transfer level. Indonesia’s poverty assistance
programme provides a disability top-up for
households with people with disabilities. While
those adaptations are no substitute for individual
disability allowances which foster autonomy and
independence of people with disabilities, they do
represent an important acknowledgement of the
economic impact of disability.

The COVID‑19 crisis has revealed significant
coverage gaps for people with disabilities and
demonstrated the importance for all countries of
developing and strengthening disability-inclusive
social protection systems. As countries move out
of the crisis, recovery plans need to be inclusive
and attentive to the realities of people with
disabilities. Designing and implementing social
protection systems with the above-mentioned
aspects in mind will be key to realizing the human
right to social security for people with disabilities.

149

X Unemployment protection schemes provide income support for

involuntarily unemployed or underemployed people, and offer
employment assistance to support their return to work, in line
with international labour standards. At the macroeconomic level,
unemployment protection schemes act as automatic stabilizers,
stimulate economic recovery and support structural economic
changes. At the microeconomic level, they improve the matching
of skills with available jobs, and provide safeguards against falling
into informal work and poverty.

X The COVID‑19 pandemic highlighted the crucial role of

unemployment protection schemes in ensuring income security for

X Only 18.6 per cent of unemployed workers worldwide actually

regional disparities. This shortfall is attributable to the absence of
unemployment protection schemes in many countries, the legal
exclusion of certain categories of workers, high rates of long-term
unemployment and restrictive qualifying conditions.

The state of unemployment
protection and its contribution
to achieving the SDGs

The twofold objective of unemployment protection
schemes is to guarantee income security in case
of partial or full loss of a job and to promote
decent employment. It can be achieved through
unemployment insurance or assistance, or an
employment guarantee, and is often strategically
linked with employment promotion measures and
ALMPs (ILO 2014c; Peyron Bista and Carter 2017).
By mitigating the loss of income, unemployment
benefits play a fundamental role in preventing
individuals and households from falling into
poverty and vulnerability when they become
unemployed (Carter, Bédard and Peyron Bista
2013), in line with SDG target 1.3 (see figure 4.25).
Unemployment benefits also have the potential to
progressively reduce inequalities and encourage
the fair distribution of economic wealth, especially

Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Art.v 9) (see also UN 2008, paras 2 and 16).
ILO Conventions and Recommendations take a broad approach to unemployment protection by setting standards
for the provision of cash benefits and services during periods of unemployment. They have a complementary
objective: to ensure that individuals enjoy income security when they lose their earnings owing to the inability to
obtain suitable employment, and to promote full and productive employment.
Convention No. 102 requires the provision of cash benefits for unemployed people capable of and available for
work, but unable to obtain suitable employment. It sets quantitative and qualitative benchmarks to ensure: (1) the
coverage of a substantial proportion of the population; (2) the sufficiency of levels of cash benefits to serve as
income replacement, allowing beneficiaries and their families to enjoy decent living and health standards; and
(3) provision of cash benefits for a sufficient period of time to serve their purpose (see Annex 3).
The Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988 (No. 168), increases the level
and scope of protection that should be provided for the unemployed. In addition to full unemployment, it covers
partial unemployment (temporary reduction in the number of working hours) and temporary suspension of work
without a break in the employment relationship, also for reasons of an economic, technological or structural nature,
as well as benefits for part-time workers who are seeking full-time work. It also requires the provision of social
benefits for certain categories of people who have never been, or have ceased to be, recognized as unemployed or
covered by unemployment protection schemes (for example, new entrants to the labour market, those previously
self-employed, among others). Convention No. 168 further reinforces the need to coordinate unemployment
protection and employment policies. The provision of unemployment benefits should contribute to the promotion
of full, productive and freely chosen employment, including by combining cash benefits with measures that
promote job opportunities and employment assistance (for example, employment services, vocational training
and guidance). The Convention also recommends the adoption of special measures for those with particular needs
in the labour market. Its accompanying Recommendation, No. 176, extends the scope of coverage and provides
guidance on the promotion of productive employment, including in times of economic crisis, as well as on assessing
the suitability of employment for jobseekers in order to avoid merely channelling them into any available jobs.
Recommendation No. 202 guides countries in defining and guaranteeing basic income security, at least at a
nationally defined minimum level, for all members of the working-age population who are unable to earn sufficient
income, notably in cases of unemployment. Such a guarantee should cover at least all residents, and may be
provided through a variety of means including universal schemes, social insurance, social assistance, negative
income tax, and/or public employment and employment support programmes. Echoing Convention No. 168,
it recommends that the design and implementation of social protection floor guarantees combine preventive,
promotional and active measures that advance decent employment and productive economic activity, notably
through vocational training for productive skills, entrepreneurship and sustainable enterprises.

The effectiveness of unemployment protection
ex tends beyond protec ting incomes and
promoting employ ment . Unemploy ment
protection that combines contributory and noncontributory schemes, linked with activation
measures, can also promote gender equality and
women’s empowerment (SDG 5). It can support
women’s reintegration in the labour market
after periods of economic inactivity for family
care and prevent them from taking jobs in the
informal sector by providing income support

during periods of unemployment,
and has been proven to increase
women’s labour participation (ILO
2016f, 2014b).
Finally, unemployment protection
schemes will be critic al for
ensuring a just transition into a
new world of work that embraces
green policies and adapts to
technological innovations (SDGs
7, 9, 11, 12 and 13) (ILO 2017c).

Types of unemployment
protection schemes
Unemployment protection schemes (either social
insurance or non-contributory schemes) can be
found in 96 out of the 199 countries or territories
for which data are available (see figure 4.27). In
the majority of cases, unemployment protection
is provided through a social insurance mechanism
(85 countries), either alone (17 countries), in
coordination with a non-contributory mechanism
(37 countries) or in parallel with a separation
payment (47 countries). In a minority of cases,
these social insurance mechanisms coexist with
individual savings accounts (as in Ecuador and
Gabon) or are provided on a voluntary basis and
financed by both contributions and the State (as in
Denmark and Sweden). The vast majority of social
insurance schemes occasionally receive subsidies
from the Government, which can serve to support
the extension of coverage, in particular in periods
of crisis.

In a few countries (including Andorra, Australia,
New Zealand, the Russian Federation, the
Seychelles and Tunisia), unemployment protection
is provided only by non-contributory mechanisms,
often in parallel with separation benefits. In
Jordan, benefits in the event of unemployment
are organized through individual savings accounts
only, while in Chile there is also a small solidarity
component. Individual savings accounts lack
the key design element of risk-pooling, and thus
provide only limited protection for those who have
difficulty in building up sufficient savings.
A growing number of middle-income countries
have recently introduced unemployment
social insurance schemes; these include Cabo
Verde, Gabon, Malaysia, Morocco, Oman, the
Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania.
In some other countries (such as Romania and
Uzbekistan), the share of social contributions has
been reduced, often alongside increased support
from the State. However, such reforms may have

X Box 4.22 Main types of unemployment protection schemes
Unemployment protection includes:
X unemployment protection schemes, provided through social insurance or social assistance, to

support jobseekers while they find suitable employment;

X employment retention schemes, which provide full or partial income replacement during a

temporary suspension of work without any break in the employment relationship; and

X public employment programmes, including employment guarantee schemes, whereby the State

guarantees employment (as employer of last resort), usually to provide local assets or services, in
cases of unemployment or severe underemployment.

These interventions are commonly combined with measures to facilitate a rapid return to employment
and/or upgrading of skills, combining income replacement with employment promotion in line with
international labour standards (see box 4.21).
Some countries use other types of provision which do not fulfil the requirements of ILO social security
standards, and therefore do not qualify as unemployment benefits (ILO 2017f, 45). The two main types
are as follows.
X Unemployment individual savings accounts require workers, mostly in formal employment, to

accumulate savings that they can use in case of unemployment. However, without risk-pooling, such
savings mechanisms provide only limited protection for those who are most at risk of losing their jobs
(OECD 2010; Peyron Bista and Carter 2017).

X Separation payments encompass both severance pay (individual dismissals made at the initiative of

the employer in line with the Termination of Employment Convention, 1982 (No. 158), and redundancy
payments (termination payments that arise from terminating a worker on economic grounds, such as
redundancy or restructuring) (see https://eplex.ilo.org/). In many cases they are offered only to those
with long job tenures with the same employer as a form of deferred pay. Unlike unemployment insurance,
separation payments are not linked to the objective of employment promotion, and increase financial
burdens on enterprises, especially in times of economic distress, often resulting in non-payment. They
thus fail to positively support the structural transformation of the economy (Duval and Loungani 2019).

Legal coverage
Less than half of the global labour force are legally
covered by unemployment protection through
contributory (either mandatory or voluntary
social insurance) and non-contributory schemes,
anchored in national legislation (see figure 4.28).22
Legal coverage rates for mandatory contributory
schemes range from 11.6 per cent of the labour
force in Africa to 36.6 per cent in Asia and the
Pacific, 46.4 per cent in the Arab States, 64.2 per
cent in the Americas and 82.0 per cent in Europe
and Central Asia. Globally, women in the labour
force are more likely than men to be legally covered

Voluntary coverage provided for in the legislation often does not result in effective coverage, for various reasons.

Renewed calls for expanded
support for those without jobs:
Global trends

In the context of the COV ID‑19 pandemic,
lockdown measures resulted in the closure
or reduction of business activities across the
globe, reducing the working hours of millions
of workers and causing loss of employment for
many others (ILO 2020k; OECD 2020; UN 2020d).
The ILO estimates that in 2020, 255 million fulltime jobs were lost relative to the fourth quarter

of 2019, approximately four times as many as
during the global financial crisis in 2009 (ILO
2021k). Governments rapidly extended existing
unemployment protection schemes and put in
place new interventions to protect employment
relationships and incomes and prevent a rapid
increase in poverty and vulnerability.
In 2020, in response to the pandemic, some
95 countries implemented unemployment
protection measures and 110 other countries job or
income protection measures (ILO 2020y).25 Highincome countries could, to some extent, rely on
existing unemployment insurance schemes, but
still had to extend coverage through emergency
measures, including adjustments to parameters
and expansion of social assistance for uncovered
groups. In middle- and low-income countries
where unemployment insurance protection was

24

Long contribution periods required to qualify for benefits can be a reason for low effective coverage. Conventions Nos 102
and 168 both require that the qualifying period be no longer than necessary to preclude abuse. Most countries require
either six or 12 months of contributions to qualify.

25

Unemployment measures cover any benefit provided to a protected person arising from the loss of gainful employment
while income/jobs protection encompasses wage subsidies, short-time work schemes and other employment or income
retention measures that concern the labour market, and that cannot be classified elsewhere e.g. as unemployment or
sickness benefits.

159

160 X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

absent, non-contributory emergency responses
were implemented (see section 3.2). The crisis also
shone a spotlight on the limitations of separation
payments (see box 4.22). The implications of
the COVID‑19 pandemic for labour markets and
workers are hard to decipher, but are troubling
for the foreseeable future at least. Governments
must maintain existing provisions, including
emergency measures, to ensure that workers
remain attached to the labour market and can
resume activity in the recovery. Such measures
need to be complemented by expansionary fiscal
policies, as high-income countries are currently
doing (see sections 3.2 and 3.3). For low-income
countries with limited fiscal space, putting in place
countercyclical fiscal and budgetary policies will be
difficult without international support.

Consolidation and expansion of unemployment
protection schemes in high-income countries
Globally, unemployment protection schemes
remain the least widely implemented branch
of social security, found mainly in high-income
countries. The economic crisis of 2008–09 led
to an expansion of unemployment protection
measures; however, this was slowed down by
subsequent austerity measures, inhibiting the
extension of such provision to, among others,
workers in diverse contractual arrangements,
until the COVID‑19 crisis once more highlighted
the necessity of those schemes. For example,

conditions for unemployment

benefits (Belgium, Czechia, Estonia and Hungary)
(ILO 2017f). Many European Union Member States
have scaled up conditions for unemployment
benefit recipients, for example in respect of jobsearch requirements or participation in ALMPs
(ILO and European Commission 2015). While these
measures may facilitate quicker (re)‌integration
into the labour market, the tightening of
entitlement conditions could also lead to lower
effective coverage and a lower stabilization impact
(ILO, ISSA, and OECD 2021; Esser et al. 2013;
Langenbucher 2015). Similarly, although more
stringent job-search requirements can be effective
in moving individuals off unemployment benefits,
they do not always support them in moving into
stable or better jobs (ILO 2019i; Petrongolo 2009).
Conversely, several countries (such as Kuwait
and Oman) have introduced new unemployment
insurance schemes or extended the coverage
criteria of existing schemes. Chile has extended
coverage to domestic workers; 26 France and
Ireland to artists (Galian, Licata, and Stern Plaza
2021); and Greece, Italy and the Republic of Korea
to the self-employed (ILO 2017f). Other countries
(such as Austria and Slovenia) have extended
coverage by relaxing the eligibility qualifying
periods for temporary contracts, or by reducing
waiting periods (Canada).
More recently, as called for by ILO Convention
No. 168 (Arts 8 and 26), certain groups of workers
facing specific employment challenges have been
given special attention. Young people are three
times as likely to be unemployed as adults (ILO
2017a) and were particularly adversely affected
by COVID‑19, notably those making the transition
from school to work. To address this situation,
several countries had already adopted schemes
before the pandemic to extend coverage to
young people, including by reducing or removing
qualifying conditions;27 these included Portugal,
Romania and Slovenia. 28 Furthermore, in many
countries (including Austria,29 France, 30 Malta, 31

26

See https://www.bcn.cl/leychile/navegar?idNorma=1149644.

27

This is in line with Recommendation No. 176, which calls for qualifying periods to be adapted or waived for new jobseekers.

28

An insurance period of at least six months in the previous 24 months entitles unemployed people younger than 30 years to a
two-month unemployment benefit.

29

Recently introduced special educational measures for young people in Austria include the introduction in 2017 of compulsory
training requirements for young people under 18 years of age who have left school.

30

Young people between 16 and 25 years of age who are experiencing difficulties benefit from a broad range of measures,
including job-search assistance, financial aid, adapted education programmes and employment integration programmes.

31

Unemployed people under 23 years of age are required to enrol in the Youth Guarantee Scheme in order to be eligible
for benefits. This scheme offers training in order to acquire the necessary skills to enter the labour market (European
Commission 2021).

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

Italy32 and Slovakia33), young people can receive
training to acquire the skills they need to enter the
labour market while receiving an allowance. The
requirement of a minimum contribution period
makes access to unemployment benefits difficult
not only for young workers, but also for other
new entrants to the labour market and those with
diverse contractual arrangements (short-term or
part-time work and disguised self-employment).
Moreover, some high-income countries have
implemented special arrangements that support
older workers, notably by increasing benefits
through a seniority supplement (as in Austria
and Belgium), extending the duration of the
entitlement (as in France, Greece and Lithuania), or
allowing access to old-age pensions or equivalent
benefits (for example a pre-retirement or bridge
pension) in line with international standards. 34
Other countries have targeted people with
disabilities (Germany and Luxembourg), parents
with young children (Japan and Malta) or women
(Poland and Spain) (ILO 2019i, 2011a).
Finally, the COV ID‑19 crisis is expected to
increase long-term unemployment and economic
inactivity (ILO 2021k). Some countries have
special measures in place for the long-term
unemployed, for example providing continued
support beyond the benefit period to those
who qualify under a means test (Cyprus, Greece
and Latvia) (ILO 2019i, 2016b) or organizing
public employment programmes (e.g. Austria,
France, Hungary, Ireland and Slovakia) (ILO and
European Commission 2015). It is important that
new entrants into the labour market, long-term
unemployed and those returning after a period
of economic inactivity receive social benefits that
are adapted to their specific circumstances and
accompanied by measures to develop their skills
and employability.35

The gradual extension of unemployment
protection in low- and middle-income
countries
Most low- and middle-income countries still
tend to rely solely on separation payment to
protect workers in cases of job loss. Receipt of
this payment is not predictable in the same way
as benefits based on risk-sharing principles, but
on the contrary is contingent on contractual
relationships, employers’ financial liquidity and
workers’ capacity to enforce payment; nor is
it linked to employment support policies (see
box 4.22) (Asenjo and Pignatti 2019; Kuddo,
Robalino, and Weber 2015; Peyron Bista and Carter
2017). Even before the COVID‑19 crisis, there
was growing interest in a substantial number of
countries in making the transition from severance
payments towards unemployment insurance
mechanisms, though in certain countries this
was accompanied by some resistance to change,
including by social partners. Social dialogue is
critical for determining how best to render the two
mechanisms complementary, or to substitute one
with the other, ensuring that both employers’ and
workers’ interests are taken into account.
Some countries with existing unemployment
insurance schemes have extended coverage
to workers previously excluded, such as young
people (Ukraine), including learners in training
(South Africa36), domestic workers (South Africa)
and the self-employed ( Jordan). As in the case
of high-income countries, the provision of social
insurance benefits is often linked to employment
support and training measures (Malaysia, Viet
Nam37), although there are challenges associated
with implementation.
In some middle-income countries, particularly
in Latin America, mandatory individual savings
accounts or separation payments administered
through saving accounts are implemented as
alternative or complementary instruments to
social insurance-based unemployment schemes

32

The National Guarantee Programme invests in active guidance, education, training and job placement measures for young
people who are unemployed or attending school or a training course.

33

Benefits to help in the acquisition of professional experience are paid to unemployed graduates under the age of 26 who
participate in the “Graduate Experience” programme (20 hours per week, over three to six months) (European Commission
2021).

34

Recommendation No. 176 states in Para. 19: “When the duration of payment of benefit is limited by national legislation,
it should be extended, under prescribed conditions, until pensionable age for unemployed persons who have reached a
prescribed age prior to the pensionable age.”

(as in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador,
Honduras and Peru). Such schemes have been
promoted in contexts with high levels of informal
employment and weak administrative capacities to
check eligibility conditions, with the view that they
will limit moral hazard (Robalino, Vodopivec, and
Bodor 2009). However, such schemes are unlikely
to provide adequate protection, because workers
more likely to be unemployed will not accumulate
sufficient savings (see box 4.22).
The job losses and economic slowdown caused
by COVID‑19 underlined the lack of measures to
support unemployed workers in many low- and
middle-income countries and territories, including
those in the informal economy. This has led to
tripartite discussions to assess the feasibility of
establishing unemployment insurance schemes
in, for example, Bangladesh, Eswatini, Indonesia,
Lebanon, the Occupied Palestinian Territory,
Saint Lucia, Tunisia and Uzbekistan. However,
in many of these countries the extension of
unemployment insurance schemes is hindered by
the labour market structure, including high levels
of informality and underemployment, large shares
of short-term, seasonal, part-time and multiemployer employment, and of self-employment,
especially among women, as well as weak or
absent employment policies and accompanying
employment services (Peyron Bista and Carter
2017). Unless the extension of unemployment
benefits is accompanied by policies to encourage
employment and formalization, unemployment
insurance schemes are likely to miss the objective
of protecting those who are at risk of being
unemployed and cultivating a virtuous cycle of
decent employment. In addition, it is necessary
to consider “employment policy” within a broader
approach which includes macroeconomic, trade,
investment and industrial policies (ILO 2011a).
Coordination of unemployment protection
schemes with ALMPs is an important way to
maximize their efficiency, and key to protecting
vulnerable segments of the population that are in
or at risk of slipping into poverty and informality

public employment programmes (as in Ethiopia,
India, Kenya, Pakistan, Rwanda, South Africa and
Uzbekistan) (Bird and Silva 2020; ILO 2019i, 2014c;
Peyron Bista and Carter 2017). These programmes
can enhance income security by offering paid work
and access to certain social protection benefits
to unemployed and underemployed workers,
especially in contexts where informality is high and
activation measures are weak (such as Argentina,
Ethiopia, India, Mexico, Pakistan and South Africa),
and thus can contribute to their transition to the
formal economy (ISPA, n.d.; Lieuw-Kie-Song 2011;
Philip et al. 2020).38
In implementing unemployment insurance
schemes, policymakers should be aware of
the technical and administrative difficulties
involved in their planning and introduction. While
ALMPs are crucial for the optimal functioning of
unemployment insurance schemes, in developing
countries they often suffer from programmatic
and institutional fragmentation, leading to
duplication of services and inefficiency (Bird and
Silva 2020), and insufficient financial, technical
and administrative capacity to provide efficient
labour market information and placement
services (Davern 2020). Given
these challenges, social dialogue,

Guaranteeing income security and
supporting the economy during crises:
Essential for a just transition
Beyond the COVID‑19 crisis, a future of work where
workers will be expected to move between jobs will
require solid social protection schemes to provide
income security for workers who are at risk of
unemployment because they work in industries
and economies affected by climate change, or
by structural changes induced by the transition
to a greener economy (ILO 2018h, 2015), or by
new technologies and automation. In addition, a
range of training and retraining, as well as effective
job placement services that workers can easily
access, will be needed to ensure that workers
remain connected to the labour market and do
not drift into extended periods of unemployment
followed by economic inactivity, in particular in the
aftermath of the COVID‑19 pandemic (ILO 2021k).
By supporting workers’ labour market mobility
and reskilling, unemployment benefit schemes
also support the structural transformation of the
economy towards higher levels of productivity

(Behrendt 2014; Berg and Salerno 2008; ILO 2011b),
in a manner that is compatible with environmental
sustainability (ILO 2016d).
The COV ID‑19 crisis has fur ther increased
inequalities and uncertainty about the future
among those in precarious employment and
young people, especially those making the
transition from school to work and those in the
first years of their working lives. There is an urgent
need for countries to act quickly to help young
people acquire the experience they need to gain
and maintain labour market attachment.

4.3 Social protection for older women and
men: Pensions and other non-health benefits

X Pensions for older women and men are the most widespread

form of social protection in the world, and a key element in
meeting SDG target 1.3. Globally, 77.5 per cent of people above
retirement age receive some form of old-age pension. However,
major disparities still exist across regions, between rural and
urban areas, and between women and men.

X Pension systems are often composed of a mix of contributory and

non-contributory schemes aimed at providing income security. As
both the expression and the result of social solidarity, and when
financed sustainably with due regard to social justice and equity,
pension systems are a key means by which States can ensure
redistribution and overcome various inequities in societies.

X In countries with high levels of informality that face difficulties in

extending contributory schemes, the introduction of tax-financed
pensions has allowed the extension of coverage to previously
uncovered population groups, especially women. However, in
many instances the benefits provided lack a legal basis and do
not provide adequate levels of basic income security that can
guarantee a dignified life.

X Significant progress has been made with respect to the objective

of extending pension systems in developing countries to achieve
universal coverage. Universal pensions have been developed in
a wide variety of countries, including in low- and middle-income
countries, as part of national social protection floors.

X Observed trends vary substantially across regions and even

among countries within the same region. In countries with
comprehensive and mature systems of social protection, with
ageing populations, the main challenge is to maintain a sound
balance between financial sustainability and pension adequacy.
At the other extreme, many countries around the world are still
struggling to extend and finance their pension systems; these
countries face structural barriers linked to low levels of economic
development, high levels of informality, low contributory capacity,
poverty and insufficient fiscal space, among others.

key messages

X

X Apart from the challenge of extending protection to uncovered

people, ensuring that those who benefit from pensions are able
to maintain themselves in health and decency represents another
important challenge.

X Adequate protection in old age remains a challenge for women,

people in low-paid jobs, those in precarious forms of employment,
people working on digital platforms and migrants.

X Public pension schemes, based on solidarity and collective

financing in line with ILO social security standards, remain by far
the most widespread pillar of old-age protection globally. Many
countries are introducing parametric reforms to their contributory
pension systems in order to adapt them to changing conditions
and ensure their long-term sustainability. While important,
these parametric reforms can only go so far in the face of macro
phenomena such as wage suppression, frozen contribution rates,
growing inequalities and, last but not least, the falling labour
share of income.

X Increasingly, public pension schemes are complemented by

voluntary or mandatory defined contribution schemes (individual
savings accounts and notional defined contributions), the
objective of which is to raise benefit levels on the basis of market
or economic performance, although without guarantee as to the
levels ultimately secured.

X The COVID‑19 crisis brought additional pressures to bear on the

costs and financing of pension systems, but with a moderate to
low impact over the long term. The massive response of countries
to the crisis has highlighted the critical role that old-age protection
systems, including long-term care, play in ensuring the protection
of older adults, particularly in times of crisis.

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

4.3.1 Ensuring income security
in old age to realize older
people’s right to social security
Ensuring income security for people in old age is
a crucial dimension of the human right to social
security (see box 4.23). Public pension schemes
constitute the foundation of systems to guarantee
income security for older people through a
combination of rights-based mechanisms. Income
security in old age is also closely related to the
availability of accessible social services, including
healthcare, home help and long-term care.
Income security for older people plays a key role
in preventing poverty and vulnerability among
older people, and is part and parcel of achieving
SDG target 1.3 and other SDGs. To guarantee that
no older person is left behind, policymakers and
legislators should aim at building and maintaining
comprehensive social protection systems based
on the principle of universality. Recommendation
No. 202 calls for contributory and non-contributory
pension schemes to be combined in an optimal
way to protect the entire population.

4.3.2 Types of pension schemes
In international practice, pension systems are
organized in many different ways. ILO social
security standards recognize the need for various
mechanisms to coexist with a view to achieving
universal coverage (see box 4.23). Public pension
schemes have proven to be effective in ensuring
adequate levels of income security of older
people, as well as in combating poverty and social
inequality. Most countries have progressively
added additional components to their systems to
guarantee minimum pensions and, in certain cases,
have established supplementary mechanisms
aimed at securing higher levels of benefits.
Thus the vast majority of countries provide old-age
pensions in the form of a periodic cash benefit
through at least one scheme, and often through
a combination of different types of contributory
and non-contributory schemes. In a few countries,
schemes offer no periodic benefits, but do provide
lump-sum benefits through provident funds
or similar programmes. Some combination of
contributory and non-contributory schemes
is the most prevalent form of organization of

X Box 4.23 International standards on old-age pensions
The rights of older people to social security and to an adequate standard of living are laid down in the major
international human rights instruments, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 1948, and (in
more general terms) in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), 1966.1
Convention No. 102, Convention No. 128 and its accompanying Recommendation No. 131, and
Recommendation No. 202 together provide an international reference framework for pensions and
other social security benefits to ensure income security, as well as access to healthcare, in old age. They
state that adequate old-age pensions should be provided at guaranteed levels, upon completion of a
qualifying period, and regularly adjusted to maintain pensioners’ purchasing power until the beneficiary’s
death. Pensions can be provided through contributory schemes and/or by universal or means-tested noncontributory schemes. Contributory pensions should ensure income maintenance by guaranteeing at least
minimum replacement rates corresponding to a prescribed proportion of an individual’s past earnings,
or minimum benefit levels. Non-contributory pensions, including means-tested old-age pensions, should
guarantee that the provision offered is at least sufficient to maintain the family of the beneficiary in health
and decency (Convention No. 102, Art. 67(c)). Together, these benefits should guarantee a national social
protection floor that secures a dignified life in old age as part of comprehensive social protection systems
that also provide higher levels of pensions.
International social security standards thus provide a comprehensive framework of core principles
and benchmarks for the establishment, development and maintenance of adequate old-age pension
systems at national level. Importantly, in the face of rapidly ageing societies and the financing challenges
involved, Recommendation No. 202 confirms the State as the entity entrusted with the overall and
primary responsibility for social protection, including that of ensuring the financial, fiscal and economic
sustainability of pension systems with due regard to social justice and equity.

4.3.3 Legal coverage
While there is an observable global trend towards
increasing both legal and effective coverage,
considerable coverage gaps and inequalities
persist in pension systems. Globally, 49.6 per
cent of the working-age population are covered
by existing laws under mandatory and voluntary
contributory schemes and would therefore be
potentially eligible for a contributory pension
once they reach the prescribed age.
At the same time, 44.5 per cent of the

not high, given that few individuals
take this option owing to the signi­
ficant contributory burden and the perceived
remoteness of the contingency, in contrast to
the immediate needs of households.
In contributory schemes, legal coverage for
women tends to be lower than for men, at 42.5 per
cent and 49.6 per cent, respectively, of the total
population. This gender gap reflects women’s
lower labour market participation and their overrepresentation among the self-employed and
those working as contributing family workers
(particularly in agriculture), as domestic workers,
or in other occupations or sectors frequently
excluded from the scope of existing legislation.
In the Arab States, legal coverage of women in
contributory schemes is only 13.7 per cent, while
total population coverage stands at 40.7 per cent.
Similar trends can be observed for sub-Saharan
and Northern Africa, where women’s legal
coverage is lower as a proportion of the total
population. While some of these women may
be eligible for survivors’ pensions, these do not
provide the same level of protection as pensions
earned in their own right.

4.3.4 Effective coverage:
Monitoring SDG indicator 1.3.1
for older people
Effective coverage of pension schemes can be
measured by two complementary indicators
focusing, respectively, on people of working age
contributing to a pension scheme and people of
retirement age actually receiving benefits.

Effective coverage of people
of working age (contributors)

Figure 4.34 presents two indicators that help us
to understand the implementation of statutory
schemes: active contributors as a percentage of the
working-age population, and active contributors
as a percentage of the labour force. These provide
an indication of future pension coverage for those
who are economically active and those of working
age who are contributing to existing
contributory pension schemes. An
important cause for concern is that,

of the labour force are contributing to pension
schemes and accumulating rights to a contributory
pension, whereas in Northern, Southern and
Western Europe, and Northern America, coverage
rates are 88.3 per cent and 95 per cent, respectively.
In low-income contexts, usually only a very small
proportion of those employed are wage and
salary earners with formal employment contracts
covered by contributory pensions. This is reflected
in the low proportion of the labour force, just
6.6 per cent, actively paying contributions in lowincome countries. Informality, associated with low
contributory capacity, contribution evasion and
fragile governance (including lack of institutional
capacity to ensure enforcement of laws) is also
more prevalent in low- and middle-income

Efforts to extend contributory schemes to all
people with contributory capacity, and also,
importantly, the introduction of non-contributory
pensions in many countries, have led to a
significant extension of coverage to workers in
informal employment, securing at least some
level of income security in old age for those
hitherto unprotected.

Figure 4.36 shows the percentage of older people
above statutory pensionable age receiving
contributory or non-contributory pensions.
Worldwide, 77.5 per cent of people above
retirement age receive a pension, either
contributor y or non-contributor y. 41 Income
protection for older people is thus the most
widespread form of social protection, significant
progress in coverage having been achieved over
recent years. Regional differences in income
protection for older people are very significant,
however: coverage rates in higher-income
countries are as high as 97.5 per cent, while in
sub-Saharan Africa they are only 19.8 per cent, and
in Southern Asia 39.2 per cent, of people above
retirement age (see figure 4.36).42

As the available data for many countries do not allow for a detailed age breakdown of old-age pensioners, the indicator
is calculated as the total number of beneficiaries of old-age pensions as a proportion of the population above statutory
pensionable age.

4.3.5 Trends in pension
coverage across the world:
Achieving universal social
protection for all older people
While challenges remain, a significant number
of countries have made substantial progress
in extending effective pension coverage in
recent years. Whereas in 2000 only 34 countries
had reached effective coverage of more than
90 per cent of the population above statutory
pensionable age, 78 countries
fell into this category between
2015 and 2020. In addition, the

and effective coverage.

As indicated by the examples presented in
box 4.24, many countries have made significant
progress towards universal pension coverage.
While some countries, such as the Plurinational
State of Bolivia, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia
and the United Republic of Tanzania (Zanzibar),
have established universal non-contributory,
tax-financed schemes, other countries, such as
Cabo Verde and Trinidad and Tobago, are close
to achieving universality through a combination
of contributory and non-contributory schemes.
These experiences show that progress towards
universal pension coverage is feasible in low- and
middle-income countries.
As indicated in figure 4.37, a substantial number
of countries have been successful in expanding
effective coverage: Bangladesh, Belarus, Belize,
Ecuador, India, the Republic of Korea and
Viet Nam, among others. In many countries,
the extension of coverage was achieved mainly
through the establishment or extension of noncontributory pension schemes, which provide
at least a basic level of protection for many
older people, while others have combined the
extension of contributory schemes to previously
uncovered groups of the population with other

a month for each recipient without a contributory pension and around US$47 for each beneficiary of
a contributory scheme. The programme costs 1.2 per cent of GDP and is financed from a direct tax
on hydrocarbons and dividends from state-owned companies. It has led to a 14 per cent reduction in
poverty at the household level and has secured beneficiary incomes and consumption.
Cabo Verde: In 2006 Cabo Verde took two major steps towards a universal pension system. The first
was the creation of the National Centre of Social Pensions. Non-contributory pensions, in combination
with the contributory scheme, cover about 84.8 per cent of the population above pensionable age, and
provide benefits of around US$53 a month (20 per cent above the national poverty line). The second was
the creation of the Mutual Health Fund, from which pensioners also benefit through its subsidy of the
purchase of medicines from private pharmacies and provision of a funeral allowance.
Namibia: The Basic Social Grant in Namibia guarantees all residents over 60 years of age a monthly
allowance of 1,100 Namibian dollars (approximately US$78), lifting beneficiaries well above the poverty
line. Beneficiaries have been found to share the grant with the extended family, especially by supporting
the schooling and well-being of grandchildren. While there are some problems in reaching people in
remote areas, the total coverage is estimated to be over 90 per cent.
South Africa: South Africa was the first African country to introduce a social pension to extend coverage
to those older people who did not have social insurance. The Older Person’s Grant is an income-tested
scheme, providing a monthly payment of 1,500 South African rand (US$112) for each person aged
60–75 years and 1,520 rand (US$114) for each person above 75 years. It is paid to around 3 million older
people in South Africa, reaching 100 per cent coverage in some jurisdictions. The Older Person’s Grant
is given to citizens, permanent residents and refugees with legal status, and is estimated to have helped
to reduce inequality significantly, bringing the Gini coefficient down from 0.77 (without grants) to 0.60
(with grants).
United Republic of Tanzania (Zanzibar): In April 2016, Zanzibar became the first territory in East Africa
to implement a social pension financed fully by the Government. The Universal Pension Scheme provides
all residents over the age of 70 with a monthly pension of 20,000 Tanzanian shillings (US$9). In a context
characterized by high levels of poverty and labour market informality, very few people are eligible for the
contributory pension. While the benefit level of the social pension is modest and on its own cannot lift
older people out of poverty, it constitutes a reasonable first step towards achieving universal coverage.
In May 2016, 21,750 people, or 86 per cent of the eligible population, received the universal pension.
Trinidad and Tobago: A contributory retirement pension administered by the National Insurance Board
and a non-contributory Senior Citizens’ Pension (SCP) provide income security for older people in the
country. The SCP is a monthly grant of up to 3,500 Trinidad and Tobago dollars (US$520) paid to residents
aged 65 years or more. This is higher than the national poverty line. The SCP cost 1.6 per cent of GDP
in 2015. With 90,800 citizens receiving the SCP in September 2016, it is estimated that the combination
of the contributory retirement pension and the SCP achieves universal coverage of older people in the
country.

measures. While the introduction of tax-financed
mechanisms covering hitherto unprotected
people has extended effective coverage, the
benefit levels often remain inadequate to main­­tain beneficiaries in health and decency.
Figure 4.37 indicates that, despite significant
efforts to extend coverage around the world
and the success stories presented above, not all
countries have fared well. Armenia and Azerbaijan,
for instance, which had achieved coverage rates
close to or above 90 per cent in 2000, have since
suffered a drastic regression.

4.3.6 Expenditure on social
protection for older people
The level of expenditure on the income security
of older people represents a useful indicator of
the level of development of pension systems, and
is highly correlated with the proportion of older
people in the population. National public pension
expenditure levels are influenced by several
factors, including the country’s demographic
structure, effective coverage rates, adequacy of
benefits, and variations in the policy mix between
public and private provision of pensions and
social services. Public social security expenditure
on pensions and other non-health benefits
earmarked for older people amounts on average

but there are large regional differences, with levels
ranging from 10.7 per cent of GDP in Europe and
Central Asia to 3.8 per cent in the Arab States.
The proportion of older people in the national
population, in combination with the level of
expenditure on pensions, offers an indication of
the economic sustainability of the pension system.
Figure 4.38 shows that countries around the world

43

are at widely different stages in the population
ageing process, with notable variations associated
with income level. In general, developing countries
have younger population structures and nascent
pension systems, giving them the opportunity to
anticipate the changes required to respond in a
timely manner by optimizing system design and
adopting reforms as appropriate to ensure the
system’s long-term economic sustainability.

While the data include not only pensions but, as far as possible, other cash and in-kind benefits for older people, they do
not include expenditure on long-term care, the cost of which in many countries is already significant and is likely to increase
further in the future as a result of demographic change.

4.3.7 Closing gender gaps
in access to income security
in old age
Securing women’s income security in old age
remains a challenge in many countries, in view of
persistent gender inequalities in labour markets
as well as broader societal inequalities and
disparities, including gendered division of unpaid
family responsibilities. All these factors contribute

to women’s lower labour force participation,
their higher representation in vulnerable forms
of employment (also as contributing family
workers), persistent gender pay gaps and lower
lifelong earnings.
For these reasons, women in many countries
are less likely than men to contribute to a
pension scheme, and also less likely to receive a
pension. While at the global level 38.7 per cent of
working-age men are covered under a pension
scheme, this percentage is only 26.3 per cent
for women (see figure 4.39). The gender gap

is more pronounced in lower-middle-income
countries, where 20.8 per cent of men are covered
compared to only 8.1 per cent of women. There
are also marked differences across regions, with
some regions having particularly high coverage
gaps between men and women; for example, in
the Arab States only 3.4 per cent of working-age
women are covered, compared with 27.7 per cent
of men (see figure 4.39).
Women also tend to have lower earnings then
men, and to interrupt their market-based work
more often to take care of dependants. These
factors lead to gender inequalities in pension
schemes; some countries have partially offset
such inequalities by introducing compensatory
mechanisms, such as pension care credits
for both women and men, or an extension of
minimum pension guarantees. Unlike public
pension schemes, private pension schemes
do not offer such compensatory measures, as
benefit levels are more strictly based on past
contributions, penalizing women for lower
contributions, earlier retirement and, where
gender-specific actuarial tables are used, for their
greater average longevity (Behrendt and Woodall
2015; Behrendt 2000).

In many parts of the world, men’s higher rates of
out-migration from rural areas are resulting in
women becoming disproportionately represented
among rural populations, where paid work, even
if available, is very often poorly remunerated,
informal and insecure. In the absence of other
forms of pension coverage, non-contributory
pensions, particularly in low- and lower-middle
income countries, help bridge gender coverage
gaps, though not necessarily adequacy gaps.
While non-contributory pensions can go a long
way towards securing women’s (and men’s) access
to basic protection, benefit levels are often too low
to allow beneficiaries to fully meet their needs.
Hence, the provision of non-contributory pensions
should be accompanied by efforts to support
women’s increased participation in contributory
schemes (ILO 2016f).
In Ecuador, for instance, 68.4 per cent of men
above retirement age are receiving a pension,
compared to 53.9 per cent of women (see
figure 4.40). For Zimbabwe, the data in figure 4.41
also show a relatively low proportion of women in
the labour force (10.6 per cent) contributing to a
pension scheme, compared with 27.5 per cent of
men. Although in many countries the proportion

of women in the labour force contributing to
pensions may be higher than that of men (see
figure 4.41), frequently women end up with a lower
effective coverage rate in terms of pension benefit
recipients, especially in developing countries
(see figure 4.40).
It is encouraging that, in parallel to the introduction
of tax-financed pension schemes, measures are
being introduced to expand contributory schemes
progressively to cover self-employed and other
workers with contributory capacity.
Gender considerations are also increasingly
gaining ground in the public debate on pension
reforms. Proactive gender-sensitive policy
measures have been implemented to reduce
the impact of differentiated career patterns on

pensions. Women’s pensionable age has been
aligned with men’s, albeit coupled with increases
in retirement age applicable to both women and
men (see table 4.3 below).
Care-related contribution credits are also gaining
ground in pension systems. They can be provided
irrespective of whether the care is for children or
other family members needing care, although
in practice credits are primarily awarded for
childcare (UN Women 2015; Fultz 2011). Promoting
the sharing of care responsibilities between
women and men contributes to greater equality
in employment and social protection, redressing
women’s socio-economic disadvantages in old
age and improving the adequacy of their pensions
(see box 4.4).

4.3.8 The adequacy of pensions
to provide genuine income
security for older people
Alongside universal coverage, the objective of
securing adequacy of pensions is also central,
yet designing a methodology applicable globally
to measure the adequacy of old-age pensions
is challenging. The notion of pension adequacy
combines objective indicators (such as the
replacement rate or the capacity of the pension
to sustain the basic needs of beneficiaries) with
more subjective ones (such as beneficiaries’
perception of the extent to which their pensions
sustain living standards in retirement or reflect
their contribution to economic and social progress
during their active years). Importantly, there are
other critical factors influencing pension adequacy
beyond the levels of pension benefits themselves:

these include the af fordabilit y of
essential goods and services such as
healthcare, food, housing and transport.
Fur thermore, assessment of the
adequacy of retirement benefits needs
to be dynamic in that it evolves over time
as social, cultural, demographic and
economic conditions change.

Securing
adequacy
of pensions
is central.

Figure 4.42 shows the average replacement
rates at retirement in earnings-related public
pension schemes across selected European
countries, indicating a troubling downward trend
to reduction towards 2070 in projected data. In
some cases, these reductions are significant, with
rates projected to fall well below the minimum
benchmarks established by ratified ILO social
security standards, notably Convention No. 102
and Convention No. 128, which respectively
stipulate rates of at least 40 per cent and 45 per
cent of previous earnings after a period of 30 years
of contributions or employment.

Pensions are long-term benefits, and so an
important consideration and condition for
gauging their adequacy is their ability to retain
their purchasing power and real value over time.
This is particularly important for women, who tend
to live longer than men and thus face a higher risk
of depreciation of the value of their pensions.
All ILO social security standards recognize the
need for pension levels to be periodically reviewed
with reference to changes occurring in the levels of
earnings and the cost of living. National practices
in this respect vary from ad hoc mechanisms to
automatic indexation, and vary across countries
and schemes, as shown in table 4.4.

While adjustment of pension levels in relation
to levels of earnings was more widespread
historically, an increasing number of current
schemes limit adjustments to changes in the
cost of living, either through ad hoc government
interventions or more protective automatic
indexation mechanisms. In this respect, ILO social
security standards set the principle of regular
adjustment of benefit levels according to criteria
such as substantial changes in either the general
level of earnings or the cost of living. In Egypt, in
2020, the Government implemented a new law
that replaced ad hoc adjustments with automatic
yearly adjustments of the pension based on
changes in the national consumer price index,
with a maximum annual increase of 15 per cent.

Many pension schemes, however, provide only
ad hoc pension adjustments, often contingent on
political factors, which risks the erosion of their
purchasing power. In inflationary environments,
the majority of pensioners end up receiving
nominal pensions with limited impac t in
preserving beneficiaries’ purchasing power.
Unless pensions are regularly adjusted to keep up
with increases in real wages or other measures
related to the overall cost of living, the standard
of living of older people will deteriorate, pushing
more of them into poverty.

4.3.9 Reforming pension
systems in a challenging context
According to data collected by the ILO Social
Protection Monitor, between 2010 and 2020
a total of 291 measures were announced by
governments in several regions of the world
with the aim of rationalizing expenditure on
adjusting revenues of pension schemes to foster
economic sustainability, especially with regard
to contributory schemes. Of these, 150 were
related to delaying pension receipt by raising
the retirement age (100 announcements), the
elimination of early retirement, the introduction
or increase of penalties on early retirement, the
introduction or increase of incentives for late
retirement, and measures aimed at increasing
the eligibility period or tightening eligibility criteria
(see table 4.5). It remains to be seen whether
and how the COVID‑19 pandemic will affect the

patterns of pension system reforms observed
during the past decade.
Reforms of pension systems to guarantee their
sustainability have been prompted by a series
of factors: demographic changes combined
with decades of wage stagnation and frozen
contribution rates; challenges related to a rapidly
changing world of work and the emergence of
precarious forms of unprotected employment;
a low-interest-rate environment; fiscal austerity
policies; and sometimes constraints imposed
in the context of financial assistance. To secure
the financial sustainability of pension systems,
many countries have introduced a series of
adjustment measures. Most of these measures
affect either benefit levels or eligibility criteria
so as to delay pensionable age, for example, by
increasing penalties for early retirement, raising
the statutory pensionable age or indexing the
retirement age to increases in life expectancy.
Some pension reforms aimed at securing financial
sustainability have tightened the link between
contributions and entitlements with insufficient
regard to also securing social justice and equity,
as stipulated by Recommendation No. 202, making

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

benefits more contingent on investment returns
and market performance, in some cases by
establishing individual account schemes. While
the introduction of non-contributory pensions
has helped increase protection in old age at a
basic level, the extension and strengthening
of employment-related contributory schemes
remains crucial in securing adequate benefit levels.
In many cases, reforms aim at adjusting benefit
levels, retirement age or eligibility requirements
(table 4.3). The ILO Social Protection Monitor
records 57 cases of reforms announced by
governments that have reduced benefit levels.
These comprise 39 cases of reform that have
decreased pension benefits, modified the
calculation formula, eliminated or reduced
subsidies on benefits, or decreased subsidies on
contributions; and 18 reform measures that have
reduced pension system adequacy by reforming
the indexation method, freezing pension
indexation and introducing or increasing taxes
on benefits.
In line with the principles and benchmarks
established by international social security
standards, which provide guidance on a range of
options for designing pension schemes, the ILO’s
approach to pension reform seeks to privilege
structural or parametric reforms in line with
these standards, with a view to securing the dual
objective of ensuring financial, economic and fiscal
sustainability while according due regard to equity
and social justice. The ILO has thus promoted
reforms aimed at achieving protection in old age in
both qualitative and quantitative terms based on
core normative principles (see box 4.25): among
others, providing adequate and predictable

the misclassification of employees to escape

While ILO principles allow and even encourage
combining contributory and non-contributory
mechanisms into multi-pillar pension systems, and
do not rule out any type of financing mechanism,
certain types of schemes, such as individual
savings accounts, generally fail to comply with
key principles established in international labour
standards, such as securing predictable benefit
levels, guaranteeing receipt of benefits until
death, participatory management, periodic
review of benefit levels to prevent the erosion of
purchasing power, and equity within and across
generations. Such additional mechanisms could
represent an option to complement (voluntarily
or mandatorily) solidarity-based social insurance
systems, provided that their financing does not
jeopardize the financial viability of the solidaritybased pillars and their capacity to guarantee
benefits at least at the minimum rates prescribed
by ILO standards, based on the core principles set
out above.
Even though a number of countries have
introduced defined contribution schemes (on a
mandatory or voluntary basis or both), in most
cases these are intended not to replace social
insurance pension schemes, but to complement
them so as to increase benefit levels. Unlike
solidarity-based mechanisms, schemes based
on individual accounts and defined contributions
transfer market risks on to individuals and
magnif y existing inequalities in the labour
market, including gender inequalities. Conversely,
solidarity-based mechanisms are key to reducing
not only vertical inequality (between high- and
low-income earners) but also horizontal inequality
(for example, between stable and fragmented
careers, between men and women) and inter­
generational inequality. Thus, from the point of
view of ILO principles and standards, solidaritybased contributory and non-contributory pension
schemes are key pillars in securing the levels
of old-age protection established in national
legal frameworks. In countries with sufficiently
developed financial ser vices and facilities,
individual savings mechanisms regulated by public
authorities, or managed jointly by employers and
workers, could complement social insurance
pensions. Moreover, while additional sources
of financing could be explored to complement
contributions in order to increase the fiscal space
and secure the financial sustainability of pension

184 X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

X Box 4.25 What do international social security standards say

about the organization and financing of social security systems?

The 1990s witnessed a drive to reduce the State’s responsibility in social security by increasing the role
of private mechanisms and gradually reducing the public tier. These reforms were assessed from the
point of view of ILO standards, which allow diverse modalities of ensuring protection without prejudging
any system, provided that it adheres to certain core principles set out in international social security
standards.
Those principles, notwithstanding their flexibility and a recognition that there is no one-size-fits-all
pension system, establish certain boundaries for reforms, including limits on the privatization of social
security.
In practice, while a number of countries have complemented their pension systems with individual
savings account pillars, in many instances these have functioned to the detriment of social solidarity and
redistribution by reducing the share of finances that go into the collective pay-as-you-go mechanisms. ILO
supervisory bodies have generally observed that pension schemes based on the capitalization of individual
savings managed by private pension funds were organized in disregard of the principles of solidarity, risksharing and collective financing which are the essence of social security, as well as in disregard of the
principles of transparent, accountable and democratic management, which must include the participation
of representatives of the insured persons. The CEACR pointed out in 2009 that these principles underpin
all international social security standards and technical assistance, and offer the appropriate guarantees
of financial viability and sustainable development of social security; neglecting them, and at the same time
removing state guarantees, exposes members of private schemes to greater financial risk.
The collectively financed schemes managed by the State, in particular through pay-as-you-go financing,
have also fared much better during crises than the fully funded privately managed schemes, which have
sustained severe losses. The failure of so many private schemes to deliver decent pensions, not least
because of the losses sustained during economic crises, has triggered a move by public authorities to
re-establish or reinforce solidarity and income redistribution mechanisms. Increasingly, as seen during
the pandemic, these basic principles are also at the centre of public appeals for a reinvigorated social
contract that puts social protection and good governance at the heart of building back a better economy.

systems, reliance on progressive tax mechanisms
offers better outcomes in terms of social justice
and equity than regressive ones, such as taxes
on consumption.
In many cases, the reduction of pension levels
consequent on recent reforms is expected to
compromise their adequacy, which in turn is likely
to increase the number of workers who resort
to tax-financed social assistance or guaranteed
minimum income schemes to ensure life in dignity
in their old age. Compliance with the minimum
levels established by ILO standards, including
Conventions Nos 102 and 128, will thus become
an issue in ratifying countries implementing
such reforms.
In the context of the COVID‑19 pandemic, some
countries drew on the reserve funds of their
pension programmes to pay emergency benefits,
raising concerns about the effects on financial
44

sustainability. According to the Federation of
Pension Fund Administrators (FIAP), a number
of countries in Latin America have proposed the
early withdrawal of pension funds from individual
savings accounts to mitigate the adverse impacts
of the worldwide COVID‑19 pandemic, thereby
depleting their savings. This has resulted in
significant reductions in worker coverage and
a suppression of or marked reduction in future
pension benefits. 44 In Chile, two consecutive
withdrawals have resulted in around 40 per cent
of contributors depleting their individual accounts.
This means that, in the future, the State will have to
finance more non-contributory pensions through
taxes, and the adequacy of pensions will also be
affected. In Peru, successive legal provisions have
increased the total amount that can be withdrawn
in a lump sum on meeting certain early or old-age
retirement requirements to up to 95.5 per cent
of the funds. Consequently, by November 2020,

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

16 per cent of the total amount of the pension
funds had been withdrawn. At least one third
of workers have withdrawn 25 per cent of their
funds, and as a result will no longer have sufficient
funds to finance their retirement. While tapping
into resources accumulated for old-age protection
to face the consequences of the pandemic does
not represent a good practice, measures to
authorize such withdrawals are motivated by a
lack of alternative funds that can be mobilized.
This illustrates the greater fragility of defined

solid pay-as-you-go pillar and unemployment
protection schemes able to better respond to
crisis conditions.

4.3.10 Ensuring income
security for older
people in the future
As life expectancy increases, so the need for
protection in old age increases accordingly. Even
though no two national pension systems are
identical, and there is no blueprint for an ideal
system, most countries have tended to secure
the future sustainability and universality of their
pension systems by introducing multi-tiered
pension schemes composed of both contributory
and non-contributory components, in which the
former guarantee adequate levels of income
replacement while the latter help secure basic
income security for older people. In the face
of changing labour markets and population
ageing, countries, especially those with more
mature pension systems, are increasingly opting
to introduce parametric changes (increasing
retirement ages or required contributory periods)
or to complement pension contributions from
general government revenue. How progressive
or regressive these taxes are, including especially
the respective shares of revenue financing from
labour and from capital, has a direct impact on
how equitable and redistributive the resulting
pension system is – for example, taxes more
closely linked to employment outputs will achieve
these objectives better than regressive taxes
on consumption.
Aside from demographic considerations, a series
of other factors threaten the capacity of States
and pension systems to guarantee each person’s
right to protection in old age. The future of work

adapted in order to secure
both sus t ainable sources
of collective financing and adequate old-age
protection for these categories of workers, without
which they will be left vulnerable and dependent
on tax-funded basic old-age pensions.
Another central challenging factor for the
sustainability of pension systems is the prevalence
– and, in many cases, even the expansion – of
informal economies. In the developing world,
informality and poverty are widespread, and a
significant share of those in formal employment
are sliding into informality. Despite decisive steps
taken in extending tax-financed pensions to
people previously active in the informal economy,
these benefits are often insufficient to maintain
a dignified life or are too narrowly targeted,
leaving many people unprotected. In addition,
in the absence of effective and comprehensive
formalization strategies, which will also result in
strengthened contributory mechanisms, financing
pensions for the majority of people in old age
from taxation represents a considerable burden
on public finances which could compromise their
sustainability in the long run. In this context,
ensuring better articulation between contributory
and non-contributory pension mechanisms,
in parallel with formalization policies, is key to
promoting employment-related contributory
mechanisms providing adequate and sustainably
financed pensions. All nations, to varying degrees,
face the challenge of securing the future of their
pension systems, and need to strike a judicious
balance between financial, economic and social
sustainabilit y by guaranteeing acceptable
financing and benefit eligibility conditions,
as well as adequate benefit levels, in order to
secure pension systems that function effectively
and efficiently, and support progress towards
achieving the 2030 Agenda.

4.4 Social health protection:
Towards universal coverage in health

key messages

X

X The right to social health protection is not yet a universal reality.

Despite laudable progress, barriers to accessing healthcare remain
in the form of out-of-pocket (OOP) payments on health services,
physical distance, limitations in the range, quality and acceptability
of health services, long waiting times, and opportunity costs such
as lost working time.

X Significant progress has been achieved in increasing population

coverage, with almost two thirds of the global population protected
by a health scheme. Still, people in the lowest income quintile and
in rural areas often face challenges in meeting their health needs
without hardship. While population coverage has increased,
less attention has been paid to adequacy in some contexts. The
COVID‑19 crisis highlighted the limitations of benefit adequacy and
the need to reduce OOP payments.

X Collective financing, broad risk-pooling and rights-based

entitlements are key principles in supporting effective access to
healthcare for all in a shock-responsive manner. The principles set
out in international social security standards are more relevant
than ever in making progress towards universal health coverage
(UHC), especially within the current public health context. More and
better data collection on legal coverage is a priority for monitoring
progress on coverage and equity.

X Investing in the availability of quality healthcare services is crucial.

The COVID‑19 pandemic has further revealed the need to invest
in healthcare services and to improve coordination within health
systems. The pandemic is drawing attention to the challenges
faced in deploying, retaining and protecting well-trained, supported
and motivated health workers to ensure the delivery of quality
healthcare services.

X Stronger linkages and better coordination between access to

medical care and income security are urgently needed to address
key determinants of health. The COVID‑19 crisis has thrown into
sharp focus the critical preventive role of the social protection
system, and the complementarity of healthcare and sickness benefit
schemes. Coordinated approaches are particularly needed with
respect to special and emerging needs, including human mobility
and the increasing burden of long-term and chronic diseases, as
well as population ageing. The impact of the pandemic on older
people has also starkly revealed the need for better coordination
between health and social care.

A key contribution to the SDGs

The COVID‑19 crisis has revealed large gaps in
social health protection. Ensuring universality
and continuity of coverage was essential in a
pandemic where the health of one person affected
the health of everyone. Accordingly, governments
worldwide swiftly responded to the spread of the
disease by ensuring access to health services
and sickness benefits, extending their reach,
improving their adequacy and facilitating their
delivery (see section 4.2.3). It is now necessary to
build on the lessons learned from these temporary
measures in moving towards more sustainable,
comprehensive and universal social protection
systems that offer effective access to affordable
healthcare ser vices and adequate sickness
benefits for all. Both support the objective of UHC.
In September 2019, the UN Member States at the
General Assembly adopted a political declaration
on UHC, reinforcing their commitment to
achieving the health-related SDGs (UN General
Assembly 2019). Social health protection is
central to reaching the objective of UHC, which
emphasizes the importance of financial protection
and effective access to healthcare services. The
SDG targets on UHC (SDG 3.8) and universal social
protection systems, including floors (SDG 1.3),
are complementary and closely linked priority
measures aimed at achieving a healthy and
dignified life for all.
Extending social health protection to all is
also implicit in SDG 8 on promoting sustained,
inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full
and productive employment and decent work,
because achieving these ends will require a healthy
workforce. Ill health and an inability to obtain
medical care because of financial, geographical,
social or other barriers has adverse impacts on
the productivity of the workforce, undermines
households’ capacity to invest in productive assets
and pushes them into poverty. More broadly,
social health protection contributes to addressing
poverty and inequalities (SDG targets 1.1, 1.2
and 10.4), as poor access to, and OOP costs for,
healthcare have been shown to affect the poor
disproportionately. Social health protection also
contributes to reducing gender inequality (SDG
target 5.4) through equitable access to care.
Many countries, including Colombia, Mongolia, the
Philippines, Rwanda, Thailand and Viet Nam, have
shown that extending social health protection to

all is achievable even in low-income settings and/
or where levels of informal employment are high.
Their experience demonstrates that a sustained
political and financial commitment embedded in
a rights-based approach is indispensable if no one
is to be left behind.

X

A rights-based pathway to UHC

Social health protection provides a rights-based
pathway towards the goal of UHC. As an integral
component of comprehensive social protection
systems, social health protection comprises
a series of public or publicly organized and
mandated private measures to achieve (ILO 2008):
X effective access to quality healthcare without

hardship, which is the focus of this section; and

X income security to compensate for lost

earnings in case of sickness (see section 4.2.3
above).

The lack of affordable quality healthcare risks
creating both poor health and impoverishment,
with a greater impact on the most vulnerable.
For this reason, the principle of universality
of coverage was underlined in social security
standards early on (see box 4.26).

X

Monitoring social health
protection coverage

Monitoring progress in social health protection
requires considering both population coverage
and adequacy of benefits (that is, the range
of health services covered and the extent of
financial protection), in law and in practice.
The SDG framework has fostered additional
data collection and provides new proxies for
dimensions relating to effective coverage (WHO
and World Bank 2020). Nevertheless, more and
better data are still needed, particularly on legal
coverage, public awareness and quality of care,
which remain poorly or unsystematically captured
(Kruk et al. 2018).
The complexity and interdependency of these
dimensions, as well as the lack of systematic
data collection on many of them, make social
health protection coverage difficult to monitor.
Good performance in one dimension does not
automatically translate into good performance in
others. For instance, while in Latin America over
two thirds of the population are registered with
a scheme and effectively use health services,
financial protection remains a matter of concern,
with high and impoverishing OOP costs for health.
The following sections present available indicators
and discuss important data gaps.

189

190 X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

X Box 4.26 International social security standards on healthcare coverage

Universality
In 1944, the Medical Care Recommendation (No. 69) introduced the principle of universality, setting
out that healthcare services should cover all members of the community, “whether or not they are
gainfully occupied” (Para. 8). The right to health was subsequently formally enunciated by human rights
instruments.1 The human rights to health and social security are understood as creating an obligation to
guarantee universal effective access to adequate protection (ILO 2019e; UN 2008). Social health protection
is rooted in this framework and represents the optimal mechanism to substantiate these human rights
(ILO 2020x).

Financing and institutional arrangements
International social security standards promote collectively financed mechanisms to cover the costs of
accessing health services, recognizing recourse to taxes and contributions made by workers, employers
and government. Likewise, the standards recognize a range of institutional arrangements, namely
national healthcare services, by which public services deliver affordable health interventions, and national
social health insurance, by which an autonomous public entity collects revenues from different sources
(social contributions and/or government transfers) to purchase health services, either only from public
providers or from both public and private providers. In practice, most countries use a combination of
financing sources and institutional arrangements to reach universal coverage.

Coverage extension
The horizontal extension of coverage aims to cover the entire population with at least a minimum level
of protection across four basic social protection floor guarantees, including healthcare, in line with
Recommendation No. 202 (ILO 2021c, 2017f, 2019i).
The vertical extension of coverage aims to improve benefit adequacy progressively, ensuring higher
levels of protection. International social security standards establish a minimum level of benefit to be
guaranteed by law. The benefit level for healthcare encompasses two dimensions:
X the range of services effectively accessible; and
X financial protection against the costs of such services.

With respect to the first element, the range of services to be included has been progressively widened.
While social protection floors should include the provision, at a minimum, of “essential healthcare” as
defined nationally, including free prenatal and postnatal care for the most vulnerable, countries should
progressively move towards greater protection for all, as reflected in Conventions Nos 102 and 130, which
stipulate the provision in national law of access to a comprehensive range of services. To be considered
adequate, in line with human rights compliance monitoring mechanisms, health services need to meet
the criteria of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality (Recommendation No. 202, Para. 5(a))
(UN 2000b).
With respect to the second element (financial protection), ILO instruments stipulate legal entitlements to
healthcare “without hardship”. OOP payments should not be a primary source for financing healthcare
systems. The rules regarding cost-sharing must be designed to avoid hardship, with limited copayments
and free maternity care.

Rights, 1966 (Art. 12).

Legal coverage

Given the importance of legal frameworks to
guarantee people’s rights to health and social
security, bridging the current data gap in this
dimension should be a priority (see box 4.27).
While there is some provision for systematic
information collection in European countries,
there remain significant data gaps for the rest of
the world (see Annex 2).
Many countries in A sia have established
entitlements to healthcare for the whole population
within their respective legal frameworks: these
include China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Nepal,
Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam.

X Box 4.27 Monitoring legal

coverage of social health
protection: An urgent need

Monitoring legal coverage should include key
dimensions of:
X population coverage, enabling the

identification of any group(s) excluded;

X adequacy of entitlements, including a

guaranteed benefit package (defined
positively or negatively), the level of
financial protection (defined positively or
through the establishment of maximum
copayments) and the range of healthcare
providers that can be accessed.

Persistent coverage gaps often reflect socioeconomic inequalities and multidimensional
discrimination against certain population
groups. For example, some countries focus
legal entitlements on citizens or permanent
residents and exclude or limit the adequacy
of benefits for temporary residents, such as
migrant workers on temporary work permits,
who may represent the majority of the
workforce in some country contexts.

X

Awareness of entitlements
and effective protection

For individuals to effectively access health
services when they need them without hardship,
it is important that such access be considered
a right and embedded in the legal framework.
It is equally important that people are aware of
their legal entitlements and how to obtain them.
A correlated proxy indicator is the percentage
of population protected by a scheme (for more
details see Annex 2). In striving for universal
protection, a large number of countries across
all income levels have made laudable progress
in extending the effective reach of social health
protection schemes, to the point where more than
half of the world’s population are now protected
by such a scheme (see figure 4.43). Regions with
lower rates of coverage are Africa, the Arab States
and Asia and the Pacific; those with higher rates
are Europe and Central Asia and the Americas.
A common challenge encountered by countries at
various levels of development is the protection of
populations who rely on the informal economy,
including informal economy workers themselves
and other members of their households (children,
young people and older adults) who depend on
those revenues for their livelihood (OECD and ILO
2019). It is necessary to ensure that they are aware
of their rights, trust publicly mandated schemes
and are willing to use them for the primary
coverage of the entire household (Traub-Merz
and Öhm 2021).
Setting the right incentives, and eliminating
obstacles to joining the formal economy more
broadly, can support improving awareness
of rights and entitlements (ILO 2021g). Some
categories of workers, such as self-employed
and domestic workers, may be excluded from
mandatory schemes. In the case of contributory
schemes, contribution levels and modalities
may not be adapted to patterns of income
for informal workers (which may be seasonal
or otherwise fluctuating). Conversely, health
benefits can be a strong incentive for workers
and employers to contribute to social protection
systems and thereby support their transition to
the formal economy.
For non-contributory and contributory schemes
alike, distance and complex administrative
procedures (such as geographical and cultural
distance from administrative authorities, issues
related to identification documents, length of
procedures and so on) can be significant barriers

to registration, disproportionately affecting those
who depend on the informal economy. To counter
these obstacles, a number of health schemes have
developed innovative enrolment procedures (see
box 4.28). Greater public awareness of rights
and entitlements, and efforts to improve health
literacy, are an essential part of empowering
people to demand health services. Only when

people understand their entitlements and how to
avail themselves of them can they play a role in
improving the quality and accountability of, and
trust in, the system. Such steps should accompany
interventions in the political and institutional
environment to improve benefit adequacy (see
below), scheme accountability and the associated
perceptions of fairness and trust (ILO 2021f).

X Box 4.28 Facilitating registration for those in the informal economy
Rapid expansion of affiliation to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) in Sudan: The 2016 Health
Insurance Act established that all residents should be covered by the NHIF to guarantee their access
to healthcare services without hardship. In 2019, 27.2 million people (67.7 per cent of the population)
were registered, a doubling of coverage since 2014 (Bilo, Machado, and Bacil 2020). This rapid extension
was made possible by the State joining forces with non-contributory social protection schemes, using
the same identification and eligibility mechanism to facilitate entry into the scheme, combined with a
proactive campaign to disseminate information and encourage registration. Such rapid extension of the
registered population requires an equal expansion of health services to ensure the adequacy of benefits.
Adapting national health insurance to the self-employed in Kazakhstan: The launch of the mandatory
national health insurance scheme in 2020 led to the rapid affiliation of 88 per cent of the population
within one year. The Government covers the cost of contributions on behalf of specific groups, including
children under 18, pregnant women, pensioners, people with disabilities, mothers with children and
full-time students. The self-employed pay a single flat-rate contribution differentiated between urban
and rural settings, the largest part of which is allocated to the national health insurance scheme (40 per
cent); the rest goes to other social insurance schemes and income tax (10 per cent of the contribution),
thereby ensuring comprehensive coverage and formalization (Kazakhstan 2021).

X Box 4.29 Integration of refugees in urban areas of Rwanda

into the national health insurance system

The national health insurance system in Rwanda comprises several schemes addressing different
professional and socio-economic groups, including the community-based health insurance (CBHI)
scheme, managed by a single central institution. In 2017, the Rwandan Government pledged to integrate
refugees gradually into the system. The enrolment of 12,000 urban refugees began in September
2019, along with the issuance of identity cards by the Rwandan Government. A memorandum of
understanding between the ministry responsible for refugees, the CBHI scheme and the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) ensures that refugees can access healthcare
under conditions similar to those enjoyed by host communities (ILO and UNHCR 2020).

The regional estimates presented in figure 4.43
hide significant inequalities across population
groups within regions and countries, further
influenced by various demographic trends. For
instance, human mobility, whether voluntary or
forced, within or across countries, is currently
happening on an unprecedented scale. This makes
it imperative to ensure portability of healthcare
entitlements for migrants, including refugees, and
to provide appropriate services (IOM 2019; Orcutt
et al. 2020). Some countries are making efforts to
include refugees in their social health protection
systems (for an example, see box 4.29), despite
numerous challenges.

of entitlement awareness, do not themselves
automatically translate into effective, affordable
and adequate access to healthcare in times
of need. Many barriers can remain in place,
compromising adequacy:
X the availability, accessibility, acceptability and

quality of healthcare services may be poor, in
practice not allowing effective access or access
to a level that would allow improvements in
health status;

X benefit packages may be limited (covering few

services and leaving patients to cover high OOP
expenses for services needed);

X high official copayments or informal payments

may be requested (again leaving a significant
share of the total costs of care to be borne by
patients).

Legal entitlements to adequate
healthcare benefits

A systematic approach to data collection is
urgently needed to establish the extent to which
core elements of adequacy (benefit packages,
costs covered, net work of providers) are
guaranteed by law. Nonetheless, data available
for SDG indicators 3.8.1 and 3.8.2 provide some
insights into effective coverage of these aspects.

Service coverage

In 2017, almost four decades after the Alma-Ata
Declaration on Primary Health Care,45 half of the
world’s population still did not receive the essential
services they needed, with large disparities across
countries (see figure 4.44) (Hogan et al. 2018; WHO
2019d). Convention No. 102 covers care of both a
preventive and a curative nature, and stipulates
that health benefits should comprise at least a
basic set of interventions,46 including pre- and
postnatal care. Convention No. 130 goes further,
including dental care and rehabilitation services.
SDG indicator 3.8.1 computes 14 tracer indicators

that remaining deficits in service coverage
are unevenly distributed across geographical
locations, income levels, population groups
and types of health interventions (Lozano et al.
2020). For instance, deficits can be particularly
severe for interventions addressing NCDs, which
are increasingly prominent within the global
burden of disease (Vos et al. 2020). Similarly,
low- and middle-income countries have lower
SCI scores than high-income countries and, while
service availability has increased, middle-income
countries struggle to match the needs of their
growing and ageing populations (WHO 2019d).
More and better disaggregated data (by sex, age,

location, migration status and income) are needed
in order to identify in more detail the population
groups left behind and devise inclusive policies
(Lozano et al. 2020).
Access to treatment and prevention for infectious
diseases (in particular TB, HIV/AIDS and malaria)
has improved in a number of countries (Murray,
Abbafati, et al. 2020). Efforts towards the inte­
gration of single-disease programmes within
existing health schemes and systems would help
to ensure the sustainability of the health gains
made in this respect (for an example from Kenya,
see box 4.31).

X Box 4.31 Articulating workplace health promotion and social health protection

in the context of the HIV response in Kenya

With 84 per cent of workers in the informal economy, few of whom are covered by social protection
programmes, Kenya launched voluntary modes of affiliation which have had limited success. While the
National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) covers over 3 million workers, only 10 per cent of these are
voluntarily registered in the scheme. Many workers and their families are not aware of the scheme’s
benefits, or of how to enrol. This is an important issue for people living with HIV: although antiretroviral
therapy is free through the National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infection Control Programme, other
costs, such as medical consultations, are not covered. Affiliation to the NHIF is therefore complementary,
as it provides access to those.
Under the Voluntary Counselling and Testing for Workers’ Initiative (VCT@WORK Initiative) launched
in 2013, Kenya enhanced access to HIV testing among workers in both the formal and the informal
economies and facilitated their access to national social protection schemes (ILO and UNAIDS 2017). In
particular, the programme incorporated advice on and support for enrolling with NHIF.

Similarly, many countries have made progress
in prov iding ef fec ti ve access to RMNCH
services, largely encouraged by the Millennium
Development Goals, with the fastest increase in
low-income countries (WHO 2019d). Nonetheless,
significant inequities in access remain both
across regions (see figure 4.45) and across wealth
quintiles (see figure 4.46). More efforts are needed
to ensure access to free, high-quality maternity
care in line with international social security
standards (for an example, see box 4.32), to
expand maternity cash benefits, and to improve
coordination between pre- and postnatal care
and income security schemes (see section 4.2.2
above on maternity benefits). Indeed, access to
both healthcare and income security is essential
to ensure a healthy pregnancy, childbirth and
postpartum period (Shaw et al. 2016), to reduce
maternal and infant mortality, and to ensure
that pregnancy and childbirth do not jeopardize
women’s rights, including their right to work
and rights at work. Similarly, global monitoring
of quality of care is needed; on this, much can
be learned from the efforts made in respect of
RMNCH (Fullman et al. 2018).

X Box 4.32 Free maternity care

in Burkina Faso

In April 2016, Burkina Faso introduced a
free healthcare policy for pregnant women,
whereby official user fees for maternal and
childcare (for children under 5 years) were
removed. This translated into a significant
reduction, though not a complete removal, of
OOP expenses for maternal care, illustrating
the need to consider additional measures
for tackling informal payments. In 2019, the
programme benefited over 700,000 women
during their pregnancies and over 10 million
children. Delays in the reimbursement to
medical facilities remain an impediment in
the programme’s implementation. Community
monitoring mechanisms help to ensure
awareness and accountability.

Alongside medicine and medical devices, a central
component of the availability of healthcare
services is investment in infrastructure and
equipment, along with the recruitment and
retention of a qualified health sector workforce.

This is true for both public and private health
sectors (see box 4.33). Significant inequalities in
both physical and human resources persist across
countries and regions, as well as between rural
and urban areas (see figure 4.47).

X Box 4.33 Public and private provision of health services
The provision of health services may be realized by public or private entities, and in practice many
health systems rely on a combination of both. The involvement of the private sector allows additional
investments in infrastructure and the expansion of the service offer. Nevertheless, the strong
stewardship and regulatory role of ministries of health are essential to ensure both the quality of care
and equitable access to health as a public good for all. It is also important that social health protection
agencies in charge of purchasing health services align their incentive structures towards providers with
the national vision for service provision.
In countries where a large proportion of health services, including health interventions essential to the
guaranteed benefit package, are provided by the private sector, considerable effort should be deployed
to ensure the population is adequately protected financially. Indeed, evidence from Bangladesh, India
and Nigeria indicates that dominant private-sector provision without appropriate social health protection
mechanisms often goes hand-in-hand with high OOP expenditure on health (Mackintosh et al. 2016;
Islam, Akhter, and Islam 2018).

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course

Ensuring availability and quality of care requires
the creation of decent jobs in the health sector,
which currently faces a global deficit of 18 million
workers, projected to increase further by 2030
(High-Level Commission on Health Employment
and Economic Growth 2017). A large number
of those workers are needed in nursing and
midwifery, where the projected shortfall of nurses
is expected to reach 5.7 million by 2030 (McCarthy
et al. 2020). Nurses and midwives play a central
role in improving service coverage, and have been
key contributors to the progress made in RMNCH
services. Hiring, training and retaining them,
including in rural areas, is a key building block in
ensuring availability, accessibility, acceptability
and quality of care in line with international
labour standards (ILO 2018b). Workers in this
field account for nearly half the global health
workforce, and are predominantly women (WHO
2019a). Hence, investing in decent working
conditions, in line with Recommendation No. 69,
the Nursing Personnel Convention (No. 149) and its
accompanying Recommendation (No. 157), 1977 is
urgent and requires the use of a gender lens to
take account of the fact that most workers in the
sector are women. The COVID‑19 pandemic has
highlighted the essential role of these front-line
care workers and the need to secure decent work
for them, including access to social protection and
occupational safety and health.
Finally, it is important that the national and
global monitoring of quality of care and patient
experience indicators is improved (Kruk et al.
2018). Social health protection institutions can
contribute to this effort (see box 4.34).

X

Financial protection

In 2015, 930 million people worldwide incurred
catastrophic health spending (defined as OOP
expenditures exceeding 10 per cent of total
yearly household consumption or income),
creating a major poverty risk, with significant
disparities across regions (see figure 4.48) and
country income groups (see figure 4.49) (WHO
and World Bank 2020). It is important to note
that low catastrophic health spending could be
a result of insufficient service coverage rather
than improved financial protection, reinforcing
the need to analyse the various dimensions of
coverage together.
Reasons why so significant a share of health
costs is borne by households may include some
or all of the following factors operating at the
country level.
X Limited benefit packages (covering few

services) push individuals to pay OOP for any
other services they require. This is increasingly
common in emerging economies, where
service coverage has increased but social
health protection schemes may lag behind in
terms of updating their benefit packages (see
figure 4.49). Benefit packages must be adapted
to both population needs and developments
in the disease burden. Also, in some countries
the healthcare landscape has changed, with
an increasing share of providers in the private
sector, while the social protection framework
may cover a network limited to public providers,
leaving a significant share of effective health
expenses uncovered.

X Inef fective implementation of, and the

socio-economic survey of access
to health services in Peru

The survey was conducted in 2015 on a
sample of 25,000 households, complementing
information from administrative records and
national health surveys. The survey focused
on knowledge and use of health entitlements,
user experience at the point of service, and
users’ degree of confidence in EsSalud and
the health facilities at their disposal. It covered
services from 29 healthcare networks and
over 200 health centres. Disparities on factors
relating to socio-economic status were

and prioritize necessary quality improvements.

absence of universal entitlements to, social
health protection push the costs of care on to
households, creating incentives to delay or forgo
necessary care, with direct impact on health
outcomes. Low public expenditure on health
correlates with higher rates of impoverishment
owing to OOP expenses (see figure 4.50).

X Low levels of cost coverage, with remaining

user fees, copayments and/or substantial
informal payments representing a high share
of the total cost of care to be borne by patients.
In this respect, recent analysis has shown that
even non-catastrophic health expenditure
has a significant impoverishing effect (see
figure 4.50), with significant disparities across
wealth quintiles and between urban and rural
areas (Wagstaff et al. 2018). These changing
realities underline the urgency of guaranteeing
the right to social health protection for all.

Especially worrying is the fact that the share of
the global population affected by catastrophic
OOP spending increased between 2000 and
2015, leading to 2.6 per cent of the global
population – roughly 200 million people – currently
being impoverished by OOP spending on
healthcare (figures 4.49 and 4.50) (WHO and World
Bank 2020). Adequacy of the benefits provided
clearly remains a key challenge for social health
protection systems.

Although the share of OOP expenses in total
health expenditure is decreasing, its absolute
value in monetary terms is increasing, and so is its
impact on poverty. These trends, which are linked
to increasing healthcare costs, demonstrate the
need for improvements in the healthcare supply
in many countries, and the need to ensure the
adequacy of health benefits (the cost coverage
component and in some cases also the extent
of the benefit package) as well as to adapt the
purchasing policies of social health protection
schemes with due consideration for equity in
accessing quality healthcare.

Adequate health and long-term
care in an ageing society

The acceleration of population ageing calls for
increased efforts to promote healthy and dignified
ageing (Wang et al. 2020). With an increasing
global burden of NCDs, ensuring healthy ageing
requires a life-cycle approach where prevention
is prioritized from an early age, and determinants
of chronic and long-term diseases are addressed
(Vos et al. 2020; Murray, Aravkin, et al. 2020). Health
systems should evolve with a greater emphasis on
preventive and early detection services, as well as
services responsive to the needs of older people
coordinated with social care services (WHO 2015).
Social health protection needs to support this shift.
In old age, people tend to suffer the compounded
ef fects of healthcare deficits experienced
throughout their lives, and this tendenc y
disproportionately affects women. Indeed, women

X

are over-represented among the older population
in all country income groupings, especially as they
advance in age (UN Women 2019). Women are also
more likely than men to report disabilities and
difficulties with self-care, owing to their overall
greater longevity and the steep rise in disability
after ages 70–75 years (Vos et al. 2020).
There are limited data on legal and effective
coverage for long-term care (LTC); the evidence
that is available highlights significant coverage
gaps, suggesting that as little as 5.6 per cent of
the global population live in countries that provide
universal coverage based on national legislation
(Scheil-Adlung 2015). The limited available data
suggest that investments in LTC infrastructure and
human resources are marked by large disparities,
some in countries with similar demographic
structures (see figure 4.51).The absence of LTC
coverage often results in women in particular
having to care for older family members, with

4. Strengthening social protection for all throughout the life course 203

X Box 4.35 Investment in LTC in Singapore
Older people represent an increasing share of the population in Singapore, which has the highest life
expectancy in the world combined with low fertility rates. People aged 65 and above represented 15.2 per
cent of the resident population in 2017, and the old-age support ratio (of people in the working-age group
to older people) was 5.2, representing half of its 1990 level. Hence the country anticipated an increased
demand for LTC and a commensurate need for financial protection.
In 2002, ElderShield was introduced as a basic LTC insurance scheme addressing severe disability,
especially during old age. Enrolment into the scheme is automatic at the age of 40, from when the
contribution period continues until the retirement age of 65. An assessment conducted in 2018 prompted
reform, and the CareShield Life and Long-Term Care Bill (Bill No. 24/2019) was subsequently adopted to
replace ElderShield by CareShield Life. While the management of ElderShield was delegated to private
insurance companies, CareShield Life is publicly managed, with the stated objective of ensuring greater
equity. Under the scheme, eligible people who need support in the activities of daily living are entitled to
lifetime monthly cash benefits to cover the related costs.
In parallel, the Ministry of Health engaged in a reform process aiming at better integrating the different
levels of healthcare, as well as health and social care, with a view to improving service supply. The Agency
of Integrated Care symbolizes the high priority given to overcoming bottlenecks for patients who need
to navigate complex health and social care systems.

limited support or respite, which can have adverse
impacts on their physical and mental well-being,
as well as their participation in paid work and
income security in working life and old age alike
(ILO 2018a).
While the need for qualified staff is growing,
evidence gathered by the ILO–OECD–WHO
Working for Health partnership in selected
countries indicates that working conditions need
to improve to make the sector attractive. The
personal care workforce47 is predominantly female
(up to 90 per cent in some European countries),
with a wider gender pay gap than for other
categories of health professionals, and a relatively
lower level of income (in Europe, 60 per cent of
personal care workers fall into the two lowest
income quintiles).
A number of countries have invested in LTC
schemes with a variety of institutional and financing
arrangements (see box 4.35). These include:

47

X dedicated LTC schemes;
X “top-up” pension benefits and/or expansion of

the scope of disability benefits;

X LTC provision embedded within social health

protection benefit packages.

These schemes can either encompass the
effective provision of LTC services or provide
a cash benefit that can be used to buy services
from LTC providers. In most cases, the effective
provision of good-quality LTC services without
hardship requires strong coordination between
income support and healthcare schemes, as well
as high levels of integration between health and
social care. Insufficient investment in both areas
leaves important adequacy gaps, even in countries
where LTC is recognized as a life contingency in
its own right. The impact of COVID‑19 on older
people has shed further light on the need for
closer coordination between health and social
care services (Gardner, States, and Bagley 2020).

(see figures 4.52 and 4.53). Although there is a
consensus that the efficient allocation of resources
should be prioritized and geared towards highquality care to achieve positive health outcomes,
various reports have noted that guaranteeing UHC
with appropriate levels of financial protection is
challenging if GGHE is below 5 per cent of GDP
(Jowett et al. 2016; Røttingen et al. 2014; WHO
2010). Of the countries for which data are available,
two thirds fall below this target.

(WHO 2018b). Its share has increased as a
percentage of total health expenditure in recent
years (WHO 2019b). Consequently, the relative
share of OOP health expenditure decreased
between 2000 and 2016, with the largest decline in
South-East Asia, followed by Africa. However, OOP
expenditure remains relatively high (at 44 per cent
of CHE on average), and, as noted above, its value
in absolute terms and its impact on relative poverty
have both increased, illustrating the need for further
investment in public domestic health financing.
Indeed, increased public spending on health from
pooled sources (taxes and social contributions) is
positively correlated with lower OOP expenditure
on health, while no such correlation was found with
funds channelled through private health insurance
(WHO and World Bank 2020). This suggests that
publicly mandated social health protection schemes,
in line with international social security standards,
provide the most appropriate pathway towards
financial protection that is inclusive of the poorest
and most vulnerable. Publicly led programmes
are at the heart of coverage extension strategies,
underlining the pertinence of international labour
standards in respect of the principle of solidarity in
financing, as illustrated by box 4.36.

acknowledge a diversity of arrangements

In some countries, publicly mandated national

private actors (private insurance companies

social health insurance should not be confused
with voluntary private health insurance. Social
health insurance is characterized by mutual
support. The level of individual contributions
is not related to individual risk (factors such
as age, sex, previously existing conditions)
but to the ability of the people covered to
contribute financially. By contrast, private
health insurance premiums usually relate to
individual risks. As such, they are not based on
solidarity and can be exclusionary of people
with pre-existing conditions.

emergency response for use in times of crisis. These systems
are essential to address today’s and tomorrow’s challenges, in
particular supporting women and men in better navigating life
and work transitions, facilitating the transition of workers from
the informal to the formal economy, bolstering the structural
transformation of economies, and fostering the transition to more
environmentally sustainable economies and societies.

X Countries now have a unique policy window in which to reinforce

their social protection systems, including floors, to achieve
universal social protection, decent work and inclusive growth,
become prepared for further crises and ultimately ensure a
socially just future. Decisive policy action is needed to close
protection gaps and adapt social protection systems to changing
conditions, so as to accelerate progress towards realizing rightsbased universal social protection systems and making them a
cornerstone of countries’ national social and economic policy
architecture. Such a high-road strategy needs to build on broad
support from governments, social partners, civil society and other
stakeholders.

X Investing more in social protection is not an aspiration to

be deferred to the future; it is required here and now. In
particular, prioritizing investments in nationally defined social
protection floors is central to delivering on the promise of the
2030 Agenda – especially attaining SDG targets 1.3 and 3.8 – to
leave no one behind, and to unleashing the potential of high human
development with high growth. Domestic resource mobilization
is critically important, but so is concerted international support
to fast-track progress in countries lacking fiscal and economic
capacities.

X The COVID-19 crisis has confirmed the vital role of social protection

as a social buffer and economic stabilizer. By making progress on
the promise to achieve universal social protection by 2030, and by
protecting and promoting human rights, States can strengthen
the social contract. This will also ensure better preparedness
to cope with future crises, including the risks arising from
climate change, natural resource depletion and environmental
degradation.

5. Shaping the future of social protection

COVID-19 has acted as a stress test for social
protection systems. It has further exacerbated
pre-existing gaps in coverage, comprehensiveness
and adequacy of protection, while also revealing
the stark inequalities in access to social
protection – across regions, within countries, and
for workers in different forms of employment.
The crisis has poignantly demonstrated not only
that from the viewpoint of human rights it is
unacceptable to deny people their fundamental
rights and jeopardize their human dignity,
but that we are all only as safe as the most
vulnerable among us. The prescient dictum
that “poverty anywhere constitutes a threat to
prosperity everywhere”,1 one of the fundamental
constitutive principles of the ILO, has regrettably
been proven once more. Consequently, while
the call to accelerate progress towards universal
social protection by taking a high-road scenario
to recovery is not a new one, it has acquired
greater urgency.
An inclusive recovery and a just transition of
our economies towards a more digital, greener,
fairer and human-centred future of work requires
reinvigorated social protection systems, linked
to care policies, that can help people navigate
transitions and seize new opportunities. As a
lubricant of change, social protection systems
support structural transformations, contributing
to the promotion of decent, productive and freely
chosen employment, providing a conducive
environment for sustainable enterprises while
supporting those who have hitherto been left
behind. In other words, social protection is
essential if a human-centred future of work is to
become reality.

Achieving this objective by 2030 requires strong

financing mechanisms. Less than nine years
remains to achieve the 2030 Agenda, including
SDG targets 1.3 and 3.8. In a world where the
majority of the population today have no, or
insufficient, access to social protection and are
locked in a vicious cycle of vulnerability, poverty
and social exclusion, it is imperative that both
individual countries and the global community
step up efforts to make the right to social security
a reality for all.
Social protection has a key role to play in
supporting people in their life and work transitions
(section 5.1) and in the structural transformation
of the economy and society (section 5.2), as part
of a human-centred approach. Accelerating
progress towards universal social protection
(section 5.3) is indispensable for achieving social
justice (section 5.4).

5.1 Closing coverage gaps and supporting
life and work transitions

A robust recovery from the crisis and a humancentred future of work require that employment
and social protection policies work in concert, not
only to improve people’s living standards, but also
to empower them to navigate the life and work
transitions they face in a changing world of work.
Tackling economic insecurity and deep-rooted
inequalities, including gender inequalities, is
indispensable to enable people and societies
to adapt to change. Such an approach not only
provides an enabling environment for individuals,
families and communities; it also contributes to
productive employment, sustainable enterprises
and a human-centred future of work, and is a
key component of an integrated policy agenda
to achieve the SDGs. This approach requires in
particular greater attention to closing coverage
gaps to enable workers to better navigate the
future of work (section 5.1.1), including the
large coverage gaps that leave migrant workers
without any protection (section 5.1.2). To do this
effectively, it is essential to reinforce the links
between social protection policies and other policy
areas, in particular lifelong learning and ALMPs
(section 5.1.3) and care policies (5.1.4). Work along
these lines is precisely what is needed to carve a
high road out of this crisis.

5.1.1 Protecting workers
in all types of employment
and enabling them to better
navigate the future of work
COVID-19 has been a powerful reminder of the
important role of social protection systems
in enabling workers and employers to better
navigate the changing world of work, by
ensuring adequate social protection for workers
in all types of employment. Social security
is not only compatible with labour market
flexibility; it is indeed a precondition for ensuring

branches of social protection
(among them unemployment
protection), broad risk-sharing, and the portability
and transferability of rights and entitlements are
essential. These measures protect workers from
loss of coverage when they move from one job to
another, during maternity or care-related leave, or
when they become unemployed. Such guaranteed
protection is essential, as has been powerfully
illustrated during the COVID-19 crisis.2 The Global
Commission on the Future of Work (2019) stressed
that the future of work demands the development
of equitable, inclusive and sustainable social
protection systems, including floors, based on
the principles of solidarity and risk-sharing,
to protect people over the life cycle. Universal
access to comprehensive and sustainable social
protection is a key element of a set of policies that
enables people to benefit from the opportunities
of a changing world of work, as highlighted in the
Centenary Declaration.
Inclusive social insurance schemes, tax-financed
schemes or a combination of both provide a
practicable mechanism for facilitating flexibility,
labour mobility and decent work, as they provide
for portability, broad risk-sharing, and sustainable
and equitable financing of social protection
systems (ILO 2018d; Behrendt, Nguyen, and
Rani 2019). Social insurance schemes that cover
workers in all types of employment, including
part-time, temporary and self-employment, can
play this role especially effectively, and at the same
time reduce pressures on non-contributory social
protection schemes and government budgets,
thereby ensuring that the social protection system
as a whole functions efficiently (see section 2.2).

This is one of the reasons why the ILO promotes the principles of collective financing and broad risk-sharing as part of the
bedrock of social protection systems, and emphasizes the importance of social insurance and tax-financed benefits as the
core of social protection systems. Other forms of protection, in particular individualized solutions that are entirely dependent
on workers’ capacity to provide for themselves (as in individual savings accounts or personal pension schemes), or employerprovided or sponsored arrangements that are linked to a specific employment contract (such as employer liability for
maternity benefits or severance payments, or employer-sponsored health or pension insurance) do not conform with these
principles, but may possibly have a role in complementing collectively financed protection mechanisms.

5. Shaping the future of social protection

The following principles are particularly relevant
for adapting social protection systems to the
changing world of work, on a basis of tripartite
social dialogue.

Adaptation along these lines should be based
on a diversity of approaches and mechanisms,
synergies with employment and other policies,
and progressive but sustained investment.

X Universality of protection, coverage and effective

Integrated policies that address the diverse
barriers to coverage, are adapted to the
realities of workers and enterprises, and ensure
sustainable and equitable financing mechanisms
through social insurance contributions, general
government revenue (based on progressive
taxation) or a combination of both are most likely
to succeed (ILO 2016d, 2018d, 2021i, 2021e, 2019b;
ILO and FAO 2021; ILO and OECD 2018, 2020). Such
integrated policies will include measures and
innovations that:

access: ensuring effective access for workers
in all types of employment to provision that
is adapted to their situation and needs, while
reaffirming that social security is an integral
component of the cost of labour and does not
represent a tax thereon.

X Adequacy: ensuring that social protection

systems not only effectively prevent poverty
but also prov ide appropriate income
replacement, and facilitate access to healthcare
and other care services throughout people’s
lives, in an equitable and sustainable way.

X Transferabilit y/portabilit y : ensuring that

social protection systems positively support
labour market mobility (within and across
borders), and are adapted to the structural
transformation of the labour market and the
economy.

X Transparency: ensuring that all actors are fully

aware of their rights and responsibilities;
that legal frameworks provide for clear
and predictable entitlements; and that
administrative procedures are as simple and
transparent as possible, fully harnessing
the potential of digital technologies while
protecting personal data, respecting privacy,
and ensuring that non-digital solutions remain
in place for those who may not be able to use
digital technology.

X Gender equality: ensuring that social protection

systems are adapted to the different realities
that women and men face in the labour
market, employment and society, and that they
promote equality between women and men.

X Risk-sharing and solidarity: ensuring that there

is an appropriate level of risk-sharing in the
social protection system, including solidarity
in financing through collective financing
mechanisms that avoid individual workers
having to bear an undue level of financial and
economic risk.

X Financial sustainability and good governance:

ensuring that social protection systems are
financed in a sustainable and equitable way,
and also ensuring their efficient management
and administration.

X prevent misclassification of employment

relationships and curb disguised employment,
guided by the ILO Employment Relationship
Recommendation, 2006 (No. 198);

X adapt financing mechanisms and modalities

to the disparate situations of workers
and enterprises, ensuring a fair sharing
of responsibilities between workers and
employers, those who benefit from their work
and, where necessary, the Government, and
facilitating registration and the payment of
contributions, including through simplified tax
and contribution collection mechanisms and
digital technology;

X facilitate social protection coverage for workers

in temporary and part-time employment
by adapting eligibility conditions, through
measures such as lowering legal thresholds
regarding minimum working hours, earnings
or duration of employment, and allowing
greater flexibility in contributions required to
qualify and interruptions to such contributions;

X ensure the portability and transferability

of rights and entitlements, especially for
geographically or occupationally mobile
workers, for example by reducing fragmentation
of social security systems;

X establish coordination mechanisms to ensure

adequate coverage in the case of cross-border
arrangements;

X facilitate the coverage of workers with multiple

employers and workers on digital platforms,
for example by introducing appropriate
online and mobile interfaces for employers
and workers, along with tax incentives that
encourage compliance;

Social protection policies are essential if workers
are to navigate a changing world of work. At the
same time, these policies on their own cannot
fully address the increase in inequalities that is
emerging from changes in work and employment
relationships. Well-designed labour regulation
and employment protec tion mechanisms,
and other labour market institutions, are also
essential to protect workers’ rights and ensure
fair competition for enterprises, for example with
respect to preventing the misclassification of
employment relationships (ILO and OECD 2020;
ILO 2020m; Berg 2015b).

5.1.2 Protecting migrant
workers and supporting
international labour mobility
Ensuring equal access to social protection is an
essential element of policies and laws to protect
the rights of migrant workers, while at the same
time contributing to the smooth functioning of
national labour markets (ILO 2018c, 2021g; UN
2018). Equality of treatment between migrant
workers and nationals, along with the extension
of coverage and effective access through better
coordination of social security systems, and
through social security agreements facilitating
the portability of entitlements to social protection,
are essential to address the obstacles faced by
migrants in accessing healthcare and other social
protection benefits (ILO 2021b; Panhuys, KaziAoul, and Binette 2017). 3 To this end, States are
encouraged to:

multilateral social security agreements to
ensure social security coordination across
borders;

labour arrangements or memoranda of
understanding;

X adopt unilateral measures, including ensuring

equality of treatment or the establishment
of national social protection floors, to extend
social protection to migrant workers, refugees
and their families; and

X set up complementary measures addressing

the administrative, practical and organizational
obstacles faced by migrant workers and
refugees (ILO 2020t, 2021g) in consultation
with their representative organizations.

To design migrant-sensitive policies and measures,
take into account the specific needs of migrant
workers and their families, and ensure political
buy-in and public support, it is critically important
to involve social partners and other relevant
stakeholders in all stages of the policymaking and
implementation process (Panhuys, Kazi-Aoul, and
Binette 2017).

5.1.3 Strengthening links with
skills development and ALMPs
Supporting life and work transitions requires the
effective coordination of social protection with
skills development policies and ALMPs, including
the participation of social partners. In the course
of this process, particular attention should be
paid to the needs of specific groups, such as
women with interrupted careers, young people,
people with disabilities, the working poor and lowskilled workers (Peyron Bista and Carter 2017).
Social protection can play an essential role in
facilitating lifelong learning, and continuously
developing knowledge, skills and know-how
throughout people’s lives. Income transfers

3

For example, the bilateral labour agreement between Canada and Mexico guarantees access to social security benefits
including healthcare for seasonal agricultural workers.

4

This includes in particular the Equality of Treatment (Social Security) Convention, 1962 (No. 118), and the Maintenance of
Social Security Rights Convention, 1982 (No. 157), and its accompanying Recommendation, 1983 (No. 167).

5. Shaping the future of social protection

should complement training and employment
ser vices, thereby fostering oppor tunities
to acquire competencies that enable access
to decent employment while ensuring a
minimum guaranteed income for individuals
participating in ALMPs. Of particular significance
is the coordination of unemployment protection
schemes with ALMPs to guarantee income security
in cases of job loss or difficulty in finding a job,
while at the same time facilitating job search and
retraining (see section 4.2.6). Such an integrated
approach can facilitate access to decent,
productive and freely chosen employment,
not least in the context of labour market
transformations arising from technological,
climate-related or other changes (ILO 2015, 2018h,
2019k, 2020o, 2020h).

5.1.4 Facilitating work–life
balance and access to care
Well-coordinated social protection policies
and care policies are essential in ensuring
access to quality childcare and long-term care,
contributing to an equitable work–life balance
for workers, and to the promotion of gender
equality in employment as well as in families and
societies (UN 2019c, 2019b; UN Women 2019).
The disproportionate impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on women workers, both paid and
unpaid, and the dearth of gender-responsive
measures in response to the crisis, are a powerful
reminder of the centrality of links between social
protection, care and employment policies (UNDP
and UN Women 2020; ILO 2020j).
Quality childcare services are an important
complement to child or family cash benefits in
giving children a good start in life, facilitating
access to early childhood education, and removing
barriers to parents’ engagement in decent and
productive employment, especially for women
(ILO, IOM, OECD and UNICEF 2019) (see box 4.4).
Moreover, the introduction of paternity benefits
to complement maternity benefits, as well as welldesigned parental benefits that encourage take-up
by fathers (through non-transferable quotas,
often dubbed “daddy quotas”), also contribute
to a more equal sharing of care responsibilities
between parents. This is critical for emphasizing
that both fathers and mothers have caregiving

5

responsibilities, in line with SDG target 5.4 on
gender equality and the Workers with Family
Responsibilities Recommendation, 1981 (No. 165).
The complementarity between cash benefits and
care services is also an important component
of disability-inclusive social protection systems,
to enable people with disabilities to participate
more fully in labour markets, support living in the
community and make appropriate compensation
for disability-related costs (ILO and IDA 2019; see
also section 4.2.5).
In the context of demographic ageing, addressing
long-term care needs remains a key challenge for
many countries. Deficiencies in existing services
of this kind became starkly evident during the
COVID-19 crisis. While in some countries (for
example Costa Rica and Sweden) long-term care
is part of national health and care systems, other
countries have established long-term care as an
additional social insurance branch (for example
Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea) or
are currently developing such policy solutions
(for example China) (ILO 2017f, 2019i). In other
contexts, the institutionalized separation of longterm care from the health system, exacerbated by
years of austerity and weak regulation of the carehome sector, produced tragic results (Daly et al.,
forthcoming). As countries move into the recovery
phase, it is essential that better access to adequate
long-term care benefits and services is provided
to meet people’s needs, and this has broader
implications for both the healthcare system and
decent work. Better provision of a variety of welladapted and high-quality support services for
long-term care – from home-based services to
community services and institutional care – can
enhance older people’s well-being, dignity and
rights, while also supporting their families.
Investment in long-term care protection can shift
some of the responsibility for care from unpaid
family carers (mostly women) to skilled workers.
It can also avoid keeping people with long-term
care needs in hospitals for lack of other options,
which can be inadequate and not cost-effective.
As well as its essential role in improving people’s
lives, the care sector offers significant potential
for the creation of decent employment in the
years ahead, for both women and men. The ILO
estimates that 30 million additional jobs could be
created in the long-term care sector if countries
were to invest in it sufficiently (ILO 2018a).5

In a similar vein, earlier studies conducted by the International Trade Union Confederation also highlighted the employment
potential of investing in the care economy (De Henau et al. 2016; De Henau, Himmelweit, and Perrons 2017).

5.2 Supporting the structural transformation
of economies and societies

As the world struggles to recover from the
COVID-19 pandemic, there is a broad consensus
that reverting to the pre-crisis situation is not good
enough if the world is to be put on a sustainable
track towards the future. Building forward
better requires the structural transformation of
economies and societies towards a human-centred
future of work and a more sustainable economy.
A high-road social protection strategy will help to
foster a more sustainable and inclusive recovery,
and a just transition to a human-centred, greener
and more caring economy. It will contribute to
both economic and social development, and serve
as an essential element of a rights-based approach
to development and decent work. It is now better
understood that social protection policies are not
merely a vehicle for the transfer of income in cash
and in kind, aimed at smoothing consumption, but
at their heart an investment in people, which can
enhance their capabilities, help them to engage in
productive employment and enable them to enjoy
their rights.
Two aspects are particularly relevant in this
context, namely the role of social protection in
supporting, first, the structural transformation of
economies, productivity gains and good-quality
jobs (section 5.2.1) and, second, a just transition
to a more climate-friendly economy (section 5.2.2),
both of which contribute to a human-centred
future of work.

5.2.1 Supporting productive
employment and the structural
transformation of the economy
An inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 crisis
requires more than the lifting of lockdown
measures. It necessitates a shift in policymaking
to tackle persistent obstacles to inclusive growth,
including poverty, informality, low productivity
and inequality. High-road social protection
policies are an important part of a coordinated
effort to put full employment and decent work at
the centre of macroeconomic, trade, monetary
and fiscal policies (UNCTAD 2020; ILO 2021k,
2021d). The IMF recognizes the need to invest in
social protection systems as automatic economic
stabilizers, especially in developing countries and
for the most vulnerable (IMF 2020a).

Social protection can play an essential role in
fostering an inclusive recovery and the productive
transformation of the economy, in particular
structural shifts to higher-productivity activities
(ILO 2021d, 2020h; UNCTAD 2020; Dewan and
Ernst 2020). It can do so through three broad
economic channels: by enhancing labour
supply, strengthening and stabilizing aggregate
demand, and improving the allocation of labour.
The following points unpack its contributions in
more detail.
X Social protection facilitates investment in

human capabilities by supporting better
nutrition, hygiene, and access to healthcare,
education and skills development; increasing
household incomes; reducing poverty and
inequalities; and promoting social cohesion
(ILO 2014c, 2017f; Bastagli et al. 2016).

X By helping people to manage risks better,

social protection can facilitate innovation and
entrepreneurship, especially among people
living in poverty (Social Protection Floor
Advisory Group 2011; Mathers and Slater 2014).

X Social protection also contributes to the

p ro du c t i v i t y an d comp e t i t i ve ne s s of
enterprises, as well as business continuity,
as amply demonstrated during the COVID-19
crisis.

X Social protection can reduce precautionary

savings, stimulate aggregate demand and
have significant effects on economic growth,
particularly through countercyclical spending
during economic downturns (UNC TAD
2020). It can help channel resources to rural
communities and stimulate local markets,
especially in contexts where the cash-based
economy is underdeveloped (Davis et al. 2016).

X Social protection, and social policies more

broadly, account for a sizeable sector of
the economy that provides substantial
employment opportunities, especially for
women, in the areas of healthcare, childcare
and long-term care, social work and social
security administration (ILO 2018a).

X By smoothing life and work transitions and

supporting labour market mobility (see
section 5.1.2), social protection systems
contribute to the better functioning of labour
markets, thereby fostering productivity gains
and the creation of decent jobs.

5. Shaping the future of social protection

In order to promote an inclusive recovery from
the pandemic and address structural imbalances,
social protection needs to become a core element
of an integrated set of human-centred policies,
coordinated with employment, skills development,
sectoral, macroeconomic, investment, trade and
fiscal policies. In developing such an integrated
approach, attention needs to be given to the
following points:
X Social protection policies should be better

harnessed as part of a comprehensive set
of policies to tackle the growth in vulnerable
employment and working poverty that slows
down domestic demand and exacerbates
job polarization (UNCTAD 2020). To this end,
policies should pay particular attention to
removing barriers that stand in the way
of women’s equal participation in goodquality employment (Verick 2018; Dasgupta
and Verick 2016). Ensuring social security
to workers in all types of employment (see
section 5.1.1) is essential for overcoming labour
market polarization and fostering productive
employment and inclusive growth (ILO 2021h).

X The structural transformation of the economy

hinges on, and contributes to, fostering
the progressive transition of workers and
enterprises from the informal to the formal
economy, in which social protection is a
key element (ILO 2020a, 2020f; UN 2020j).
Accelerating the extension of coverage to those
workers who are not yet adequately covered
must be at the centre of the agenda. Not only
does the extension of the contribution base
create more fiscal space for social protection,
the formalization of businesses also widens the
tax base, improving the financing mix for social
protection and other public services.

X A more systematic effort to tackle inequalities

that inhibit social development and economic
growth is indispensable for a more inclusive
recovery and future of work (UNDP 2019).
There are concerns that the COVID-19 crisis has
exacerbated inequalities and reduced social
mobility (see section 3.1), a trend which – if
left unchecked – may lead to long-lasting
grievances and ultimately to social unrest
(Georgieva and Gopinath 2020; UN 2020g).

6

X Investment in the social infrastructure –

including good-quality healthcare, education,
childcare and long-term care services (see
section 5.1.4) – also contributes to building
a high-road strategy towards employment
generation in key sectors. Well-designed and
well-resourced public services, as well as wellregulated private services, are essential for
progress in social development and gender
equality (UN 2019c). The ILO has estimated
that investing in good-quality care services
could result in 269 million additional jobs
being created compared to the number of
jobs in 2015, especially benefiting women (ILO
2018a). In conjunction with efforts to improve
working conditions and ensure decent work
in the care sector, especially for front-line
workers, such policies would deliver a triple
dividend: enhancing human capabilities of
care recipients; generating employment in
the sector itself; and facilitating women’s
participation in the labour market by reducing
the time they allocate to unpaid care work.

X Ef fective policies to manage migration

have an important contribution to make to
structural transformation, by harnessing
the potential of migration as a source of
prosperity and innovation in such a way
as to benefit both countries of origin and
destination, and migrant workers themselves
(UN 2018). Ensuring the inclusion of migrant
workers in social security schemes and the
portability of their rights and entitlements
can facilitate labour mobility, including return
and reintegration, promote formalization, and
ensure the proper functioning of integrated
labour markets by avoiding labour cost
differentials between national and migrant
workers (ILO 2020q, 2021g). Migrant workers
can play an important role in addressing
labour shortages, particularly in economies
with ageing workforces, thereby contributing
to the sustainability of social security systems
(ILO 2020q). Comprehensive policies, including
tax incentives, simplification of procedures
and information campaigns, can support the
extension of coverage in sectors with a high
number of migrant workers, such as domestic
service (ILO 2019a, 2021g, 2021h).6

Argentina has significantly increased social security coverage among migrant domestic workers, and thereby contributed
to their formalization. Mexico has introduced an electronic registration system to facilitate the formalization of domestic
workers, allowing employers to quickly and easily register and pay social insurance contributions for their domestic
employees. France also significantly increased social insurance coverage of domestic workers through a service voucher
system, which it introduced in 2006.

5.2.2 Supporting a just
transition to a more
climate‑friendly economy
The climate crisis is an existential threat to
humankind, disrupting people’s lives and the world
of work (ILO 2019e). The effects of climate change,
such as sea-level rises, higher temperatures,
heatwaves, floods, droughts and other extreme
weather shocks can further exacerbate existing
life-cycle risks. At the same time, climate change
mitigation measures, including efforts to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, can create new
employment opportunities in environmentally
sustainable sectors of the economy. The ILO
estimates that 24 million new jobs could be
created by 2030 through efforts to reduce
carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, and
to improve energy and resource efficiency (ILO
2018h). Measures to reskill workers and provide
social protection will be necessary to ensure a “just
transition” to greener economies and societies,
supporting workers whose livelihoods depend
on carbon-intensive sectors, as reflected in the
Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015). The ILO has also
adopted tripartite guidelines for a just transition
to ensure that structural transitions towards
greater sustainability are socially equitable (ILO,
2015), and is spearheading the implementation of
the UN-wide Climate Action for Jobs initiative to
operationalize those guidelines.
Social protection is at the heart of any just transition
process, playing a twofold role. First, it can be used
to protect populations at increased risk of climaterelated hardship, thus supporting adaptation
efforts. Social protection benefits and services,
such as healthcare, unemployment protection,
social assistance and employment guarantee
schemes, can support individuals and households
affected by extreme weather or slow-onset events
linked to climate change in coping with changing
conditions. Many countries are adapting existing
schemes and programmes or designing new ones
to provide climate-responsive social protection
for households at risk. Examples include the
Philippines’ use of a pre-existing employment
guarantee scheme to provide
income-earning opportunities
for poorer households affected
by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013,
Social protection
af f iliating par ticipants to
is at the heart of
state-run social protection
any just transition
schemes for health and
employment injury (ILO and
process.

AFD 2016b). Algeria’s National Fund for Paid
Leave and Weather-related Unemployment in
the Infrastructure Sector (CACOBATPH) provides
workers unable to work owing to extreme
weather conditions (including heat) with partial
unemployment benefits, paid to more than
195,000 workers in 2018. Having social protection
measures in place before an event occurs helps
to expedite relief, and is more cost-efficient than
response efforts designed and implemented only
after the shock.
Second, social protection is essential to support
individuals and households that are negatively
affected by green policies, such as national
efforts to implement commitments to reduce
GHG emissions according to the nationally
determined contributions (NDCs) specified
under the Paris Agreement of 2015. Some climate
policies will inevitably have negative impacts on
workers or other segments of the population
whose livelihoods are tied to unsustainable
practices. Social protection provision, including
unemployment benefits, cash and in-kind
transfers and public works programmes, can
help those who lose their jobs, encounter new
restrictions on their livelihood activities or face
higher prices for their essential energy needs. By
offsetting the side effects of green policies, social
protection contributes to their acceptability and
to strengthening social consensus (ILO 2017f).
For example, China extended unemployment
benefits and services to workers affected by
environmental conservation measures, and
made cash transfers to populations affected
by land-use restrictions to discourage land
clearing for agricultural use and promote forest
protection (ILO and AFD 2016a). Costa Rica and
the United States identified social protection as a
strategic element of decarbonization policies in
their long-term development strategies aimed at
reducing GHG emissions (Lambeau and Urban,
forthcoming). The EU’s Green Deal, launched
in 2020 with the aim of facilitating a transition
towards a zero-carbon economy while leaving no
one behind, includes a just transition mechanism.
The related Just Transition Fund aims at mobilizing
at least €100 billion to support the regions, sectors
and workers that will be most affected by the
transition, complementing other recent initiatives,
including the European Pillar of Social Rights and
a European Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme
(Lambeau and Urban, forthcoming).
Countries have been increasingly mainstreaming
social and health protection into international,
regional and national policies and plans in response

5. Shaping the future of social protection

to climate change challenges. As the health sector
is recognized in 55 per cent of NDCs as being
particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate
change, a number of countries (such as Cambodia,
Ecuador, Egypt and the Republic of Moldova)
have identified specific measures to enhance the
adaptability of this sector. These measures include
improving health infrastructure, service delivery
and capacities, and expanding access to affordable

X

healthcare, including to populations living in
remote locations and areas vulnerable to the
effects of climate change. Many countries (among
them the Marshall Islands, Peru and Viet Nam)
have integrated social protection into their climate
plans, with a particular focus on the needs and
vulnerabilities of specific groups (self-employed
farmers in Egypt, rural workers in the Republic of
Moldova, and mothers and children in Tajikistan).

5.3 Strengthening social protection systems
to accelerate progress towards universal
social protection

5.3.1 Reinforcing social
protection systems

X

Ultimately, taking a high-road approach to
achieving universal social protection requires
giving clear priority to extending coverage to
hitherto uncovered categories of the population,
improving the quality of benefits and services,
def ining clear right s and corresponding
obligations for the State and individuals alike,
and ensuring sustainable and equitable financing
structures. Well-designed policies and strong
institutional capacities are indispensable for
building social protection systems. As a direct
interface between people and the State, social
protection systems constitute an important
element of effective, accountable and inclusive
institutional frameworks that people should
be able to trust and depend upon. Trust and
accountability in turn contribute to peaceful and
inclusive societies (SDG 16).

Achieving universal social protection calls for the
formulation of a strategic approach – embodied in
national social protection policies and strategies –
that provides a clear road map setting out routes
towards reducing coverage and adequacy gaps,
ensuring policy coherence, and developing
synergies with other economic and social policies.
In a world characterized by ever-increasing
complexities, interconnectedness and dislocations
at both the individual and the societal level, it
becomes all the more important to understand
and respond to people’s diverse and changing
needs. Such an approach will need to be more
systemic and integrated than a narrow safety-net
approach; it should also address the need for
adequate protection of all members of society at
all times, aiming not just to reduce but to prevent
poverty and destitution. Priority should be given
to closing gender gaps and other shortfalls in
social protection provision, including for migrants
and the forcibly displaced, ethnic minorities and
people with disabilities (UNPRPD et al. 2020; UN
2020c; De Schutter 2020).

The ILO’s normative framework, as reaffirmed by
the Centenary Declaration and the Conclusions
of the International Labour Conference 2021 (see
box 1.2), provides essential guidance for countries
seeking to reinforce and adapt their social
protection systems for the future.

Taking a high-road approach to achieving
universal social protection requires giving
clear priority to extending coverage
to hitherto uncovered categories
of the population.

Formulating and implementing
national social protection strategies
and policies through social dialogue

Effective social dialogue contributes to making
policies more inclusive, transparent, consensual
and well-balanced, and therefore able to achieve
greater buy-in and ownership (ILO 2018e, 2019i).
In a recent review of 50 national social protection
strategies and policies, only eight acknowledged
the par ticipation of social par tners ( ILO,
forthcoming d), illustrating that social dialogue
urgently needs to become the rule rather than
the exception.

X

Enshrining social protection in law

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of
the world’s population could not be sure that
the State would provide the protection they
needed, let alone that they would be able to
hold the State and those acting on its behalf
accountable through institutional and legal
frameworks. Benefit “cliff-fall” scenarios, whereby
emergency programmes end prematurely and
leave individuals without protection, have been a
recurrent concern throughout the crisis. This is not
consistent with a human-rights based approach to
social protection that is embedded in a system of
rights and corresponding obligations and ensures
that benefit entitlements are prescribed by law,
guaranteeing their continuity and predictability.
When social protection is not enshrined in law and
is not predictable, individuals are not able to reap
its socio-economic dividends (see section 1.2);
without the assurance of protection, individuals
may be reluctant to take financial risks that have
medium- to long-term pay-offs, such as investing
in health, education or upskilling. It is therefore
critically important to enshrine social protection
in law, integrating temporary programmes
into sustainable social protection systems, and
ensuring that legal coverage translates into
effective coverage (see section 2.1).

X

Building trust and raising
awareness

States need to create an enabling context
where individuals are aware of their rights
and obligations, and have trust in the system.
This can be done by increasing transparency,
accountability and sustainability, and ensuring
the quality of benefits and services. Partnerships
with workers’ and employers’ organizations are a
key element of this process, as is the integration
of social protection in school and training curricula
(Méndez and Giroud-Castiella 2019). Awareness
and trust are particularly important in the context
of contributory systems, where individuals who
contribute today need to have the certitude that
they will be adequately protected when needs
arise. Having trust in the social protection system,
and seeing its tangible benefits, including the
quality of its services, will also enhance individuals’
willingness to pay taxes to sustain it.

X

Coherence with social, economic
and employment policies

Especially in times of great upheaval – as
demonstrated during the COVID-19 response,
but also with a view to supporting work and life
transitions and structural transformations – it
is crucial that social protection be coordinated
with other social and economic policies,
including employment and sectoral policies.
Such coordination is essential for achieving
greater policy coherence, creating synergies and
exercising maximum impact (see also section 3.2).
Policy areas that would benefit from coordination
with social protection policies include formalizing
informal employment arrangements and
enterprises, promoting the transition from the
brown to the green economy and bolstering public
investment in the care economy. Employment
policies and ALMPs will accelerate and sustain
recovery, and ensure decent work beyond the
crisis. The close coordination of these policies
can suppor t integrated solutions, such as
providing unemployed workers with income
security through employment retention, public
employment or unemployment support schemes,
and with training opportunities to enable them
to reskill or enhance their existing skills. Social
protection can also be better integrated with
family-friendly policies, for example on childcare
and parental leave, to guarantee family income
security and well-being, and reduce the care
burden on women, while also creating decent jobs
in the care sector (see box 4.4).

X

Enhancing resilience

Resilience has become a buzzword in recent
years, in particular around adaptation to and
mitigation of climate change, and in relation to
disaster risk reduction. Comprehensive social
protection systems, including floors, contribute
to preventing, containing and mitigating crises,
promoting swift recovery and building resilience
in the wake of shocks. In recognizing this critical
role, it is important to emphasize the strategic
links between short-term relief interventions,
humanitarian assistance, and the systematic
development of nationally owned and sustainable
social protection systems – which again requires
coordination among the respective actors in
appropriate forums.

5. Shaping the future of social protection 221

5.3.2 Ensuring sustainable
and equitable investment
in social protection
Current worldwide social protection expenditure
remains insuf ficient to guarantee national
social protection floors, let alone to provide
progressively higher levels of protection to
as many people as possible (see section 2.3).
Par ticularly for low-income countries, the
additional amounts of investment needed to
achieve SDG targets 1.3 and 3.8 are daunting
in comparison to their economic capacity. On
average, meeting these targets would require
the outlay of 16 per cent of their 2020 GDP (Durán
Valverde et al. 2020). Yet increased investment
in social protection is not an aspiration to be
deferred to the future; it is required here and
now. Social protection has multiple desirable
impacts and represents an important social and
economic investment (see section 1.2). Such
investment can unleash patterns of high human
development along with high growth, whereas
its absence risks leaving economies trapped in a
cycle of low cost and low human development.
Inevitably, closing the financing gap for social
protec tion is primaril y about increasing
the domestic fiscal space (Ortiz et al. 2019).
Governments, social partners, and other actors
at the national and international levels need to
deliberate on the optimal balance of different
financing modalities and policy options in their
particular national contexts (see section 2.3), with
due regard to solidarity in financing, financial,
fiscal and economic sustainability, and social
justice and equity. The successful undertaking
of such deliberations requires strong alignment
between national social protection strategies and
medium-term national financing frameworks.
There are diverse options for expanding fiscal
space, including increasing revenue from taxes
and social security contributions, with careful
consideration of the links between policies on
taxation, labour markets, employment and
enterprise formalization. Social security is an
integral component of, not a tax on, the cost of
labour. To be effective, national efforts need not
only to improve the efficiency of the domestic
taxation system – and also its progressivity,
which would help to address rising income
inequality – but also to be grounded in greater
international cooperation on tax matters. Such
cooperation includes the important initiative

to fight tax base erosion and profit shifting,
and proposals for a unitary tax system. Efforts
at the domestic level can be further supported
by creating greater polic y space for more
accommodating macroeconomic frameworks.
The commitments made by the IFIs to secure
fiscal space for social spending (IMF 2019) have
a critical role to play in enabling, rather than
circumscribing, national social protection policies.
Closing social protection financing gaps in lowincome countries also requires strengthening
ODA. Most OECD countries fall woefully short
of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of GNI for
ODA; preliminary figures for 2019 show an
average value of just 0.3 per cent of combined
GNI for all OECD DAC countries (OECD 2021).
Beyond technical support, this could include
the temporary and partial financing of social
protection benefits in low- and middle-income
countries, prioritizing low-income countries and
investment in social protection floors, which
could act as a catalyst to promote domestic
resource mobilization.

5.3.3 Partnering for
universal social protection
If there is a silver lining to the COVID-19 crisis, it
may be found in broader support for investing
in social protection systems as a catalyst for
an inclusive recovery, contributing to greater
resilience in the face of global risks and mounting
insecurit y. Social protec tion s ystems are
recognized as one of the key policy instruments
that policymakers have at their disposal to address
inequalities, advance social inclusion and build – or
rebuild – a social contract. The call for action
issued by the Global Partnership for Universal
Social Protection (USP2030) identified five priority
actions that are highly relevant for countries at all
levels of development (USP2030 2019):
1. Protection throughout the life cycle:
Establish universal social protection systems,
including floors, that provide adequate
protection throughout the life cycle, combining
social insurance, social assistance and other
means, anchored in national strategies and
legislation.
2. Universal coverage: Provide universal access
to social protection and ensure that social
protection systems are rights-based, gendersensitive and inclusive, leaving no one behind.

222 X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

3. National ow ne r ship: D e ve lop s o cial
protection strategies and policies based on
national priorities and circumstances, in close
cooperation with all relevant actors.
4. Sustainable and equitable financing:
Ensure the sustainability and fairness of social
protection systems by prioritizing reliable
and equitable forms of domestic financing,
complemented by international cooperation
and support where necessary.
5. Participation and social dialogue: Strengthen
governance of social protection systems
through institutional leadership, multi-sector
coordination, and the participation of social
partners and other relevant and representative
organizations, to generate broad-based
support and promote the effectiveness of
services.

X

In a highly globalized world, the issue of financing
social protection cannot be left to national
governments alone; solidarity, coordination and
cooperation at the global level are indispensable
in the search for workable solutions that serve
everyone, while respecting the principle of
country ownership. The systematic advancement
of coordination and collaboration between UN
agencies, development partners and IFIs on the
design and financing of social protection remains
a priority. All financing and policy decisions
should be informed by human rights obligations
and international social security standards.
These instruments provide critical guidance on
the objectives that should guide efforts to build
social protection, how the adequacy of social
protection can be assured, and how sustainable,
efficient and equitable financing (ILO 2019i) for it
can be secured.

5.4 Social protection for social justice

A human-centred recovery calls for universal
access to comprehensive, well-adapted and
sustainable social protection systems that provide
adequate levels of benefits for all, during the
entire life course, and in response to a multitude of
possible shocks (ILO 2021b). A high-road strategy
is needed to break the vicious cycle of vulnerability,
poverty and social exclusion, and to build fairer
and more inclusive societies, and sustainable and
productive economies. Investing in robust and
adaptable rights-based social protection systems,
including floors, together with a coherent set
of employment, economic and social policies,
enables people to better navigate life and work
transitions and facilitates the transformation of
economies and societies. Returning to the preCOVID-19 world will not be sufficient to achieve this
inclusive recovery. To do that, it will be essential to
address the deep structural inequalities that have
obstructed progress towards social justice for
too long, and to take a decisively human-centred
approach to building a better future for humanity
(UN 2020b).

Mapping out a pathway towards achieving the
SDGs will require a determined strategy to build
rights-based social protection systems, including
floors, based on a shared understanding of
social protection as an investment with high
returns, offering a way to end poverty, reduce
inequalities and reinvigorate the social contract.
A pronounced shift of gears is needed in efforts
towards achieving the SDGs by 2030 if people
and societies are to be able to address the
profound transformations that are associated with
demographic, technological and climate change.
Less than nine years remains to achieve the
2030 Agenda, including SDG targets 1.3 and 3.8.
The pandemic has demonstrated the centrality of
the objectives of universal social protection and
universal health coverage, the enormous gains
to be made if they are accorded policy priority,
and the risks associated with failure to do so.
Poverty anywhere remains a threat to prosperity
everywhere; and no one is safe until everyone
is safe.

Annex 1. Glossary

This glossary focuses on the basic concepts,
def initions and methodology guiding the
analytical work of the ILO on social security or
social protection.1 It does not set out to assert
any universal definitions; its purpose is simply to
clarify how terms and concepts are used in this
report and in the ILO more broadly.
Cash transfer programme Non-contributory
scheme or programme providing cash benefits to
individuals or households, usually financed out of
taxation, other government revenue, or external
grants or loans. Cash transfer programmes2 may
or may not include a means test.
Cash transfer programmes that provide cash to
families subject to the condition that they fulfil
specific behavioural requirements are referred to
as conditional cash transfer programmes (CCTs).
For example, beneficiaries may be required
to ensure that their children attend school
regularly, or to use basic preventive nutrition and
healthcare services.
Contributor y scheme Schemes in which
contributions made by protected persons (actual
or potential beneficiaries) directly determine
entitlement to benefits (acquired rights). The
most common form of contributor y social
security scheme is a statutory social insurance
scheme, usually covering workers in formal wage
employment and, in some countries, the selfemployed. Other common types of contributory
schemes, providing – in the absence of social
insurance – a certain level of protection include
national provident funds, which usually pay a lump
sum to beneficiaries when particular contingencies
occur (typically old age, invalidity or death). In the
case of social insurance schemes for those in wage
or salaried employment, contributions are usually
paid by both employees and employers (though
in general, employment injury schemes are fully
financed by employers). Contributory schemes
can be wholly financed through contributions but
are often partly financed from taxation or other
sources; this may be done through a subsidy to
cover the deficit, or through a general subsidy
supplanting contributions altogether, or through

subsidies directed specifically at certain groups
of contributors or beneficiaries (for example,
those not contributing because they are caring
for children, studying, in military service or
unemployed, or have too low a level of income to
make full contributions, or receive benefits below
a certain threshold because of low contributions
in the past).
Employment guarantee scheme Public
employment programme which provides a
guaranteed number of days’ work per year to
poor households, generally providing wages at a
relatively low level (typically at the minimum wage
level if this is adequately defined).
Means-tested scheme A scheme that provides
benefits upon proof of need and targets certain
categories of individuals or households whose
means fall below a certain threshold. These
schemes are also often referred to as social
assistance schemes (for which see also below).
A means test is used to assess whether the
individual’s or household’s own resources (income
and/or assets) are below a defined threshold to
determine whether the applicants are eligible for
a benefit at all, and if so at what level that benefit
will be provided. In some countries, proxy means
tests are used; that is, eligibility is determined
without actually assessing income or assets,
on the basis of other household characteristics
(proxies such as household composition, housing
characteristics, productive assets or level of
education of household members) that are
deemed more easily observable. Means-tested
schemes may also include entitlement conditions
and obligations, such as work requirements,
participation in health check-ups or (for children)
school attendance. Some means-tested schemes
also include other interventions that are delivered
on top of the actual income transfer itself.
Non-contributory schemes Non-contributory
schemes, which include non-means-tested and
means-tested schemes, normally require no
direct contribution from beneficiaries or their
employers as a condition of entitlement to receive
relevant benefits. The term covers a broad range

1

The glossary draws largely on the definitions, concepts and methods provided in previous editions of this report (ILO 2010,
2014c, 2017f).

2

Strictly speaking, this term would encompass all social transfers provided in cash, including fully or partially contributory
transfers. However, it is usually understood as limited to non-contributory transfers.

226 X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

of schemes, including universal schemes for
all residents (such as national health services),
categorical schemes for certain broad groups of
the population (such as children below a certain
age, or older people above a certain age) and
means-tested schemes (such as social assistance
schemes). Non-contributory schemes are usually
financed through taxes or other state revenues,
or, in certain cases, through external grants
or loans.
Public employment programme Government
programme offering employment opportunities
to certain categories of people who are unable
to find other employment. Public employment
programmes include employment guarantee
schemes (see above) and “cash for work” and “food
for work” programmes.
S ocial assis t ance scheme/programme
A scheme that provides benefits to vulnerable
groups of the population, especially households
living in poverty. Most social assistance schemes
are means-tested.
Social insurance scheme Contributory social
protection scheme that guarantees protection
through an insurance mechanism, based
on:   (1) the payment of contributions before the
occurrence of the insured contingency; (2) the
sharing or “pooling” of risk; and (3) the notion
of a guarantee. The contributions paid by (or
for) insured people are pooled together, and
the resulting fund is used to cover the expenses
incurred exclusively by those individuals affected
by the occurrence of the relevant (clearly defined)
contingency or contingencies. In contrast to
commercial insurance, risk-pooling in social
insurance is based on the principle of solidarity,
with contributions typically related to people’s
capacity to pay (e.g. proportional to earnings) as
opposed to premiums that reflect individual risks.
Many contributory social security schemes are
presented and described as “insurance” schemes
(usually “social insurance schemes”), despite being
in actual fact of mixed character, with some noncontributory elements in entitlement to benefits;
this allows for a more equitable distribution of
benefits, particularly for those with low incomes
and short or broken work careers, among others.
These non-contributory elements take various
forms, being financed either by other contributors
(redistribution within the scheme) or by the State.
Social protection Social protection, or social
security, is a human right and is defined as
the set of policies and programmes designed
to reduce and prevent poverty, vulnerability

and social exclusion throughout the life cycle.
Social protection includes nine main areas:
child and family benefits, maternity protection,
unemployment support, employment injury
benefits, sickness benefits, health protection
(medical care), old-age benefits, invalidity/
disability benefits, and survivors’ benefits. Social
protection systems address all these policy areas
by a mix of contributory schemes (social insurance)
and non-contributory tax-financed benefits
(including social assistance).
As a human right, social protection, or social
security, is enshrined as such in the Universal
Declaration of Human Right s (19 4 8), the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights (1966), and other major United
Nations human rights instruments. States have
a legal obligation to protect and promote human
rights, including the right to social protection,
or social security, and to ensure that people
can realize their rights without discrimination.
The overall responsibility of the State includes
ensuring the due provision of benefits according
to clear and transparent eligibility criteria and
entitlements, and the proper administration of
the institutions and services. Where benefits
and services are not provided directly by public
institutions, the effective enforcement of the
legislative framework is particularly important for
the provision of benefits and services (UN 2008).
”Social protection” is a current term used to refer
to “social security”, and generally the two terms are
used interchangeably. It must be noted, however,
that the term “social protection” is sometimes
used to cover a broader range of services than
“social security”, including protection provided
between members of the family or members of
a local community; on other occasions it is also
used with a narrower meaning, understood as
comprising only measures addressed to the
poorest, most vulnerable or excluded members of
society. In the majority of contexts, however, the
two terms, “social security” and “social protection”,
are largely interchangeable, and the ILO and other
United Nations institutions use both in discourse
with their constituents and in the provision of
relevant advice to them.
Social protection floor ILO Recommendation
No. 202 stipulates that Member States should
establish and maintain national social protection
floors as a nationally defined set of basic social
security guarantees which secure protection
aimed at preventing or alleviating poverty,
vulnerability and social exclusion (ILO 2012). These
guarantees should ensure, at a minimum, that

Annex 1. Glossary 227

over the life cycle all in need have effective access
to at least essential healthcare and basic income
security. These together ensure effective access to
essential goods and services defined as necessary
at the national level. More specifically, national
social protection floors should comprise at least
the following four social security guarantees, as
defined at the national level:
(a) access to essential healthcare, including
maternity care;
(b) basic income security for children;
(c) basic income security for persons of working
age who are unable to earn suf f icient
income, in particular in cases of sickness,
unemployment, maternity and disability; and
(d) basic income security for older persons.3
Such guarantees should be provided to all
residents and all children, as defined in national
laws and regulations, and subject to existing
international obligations.
Recommendation No. 202 also states that basic
social security guarantees should be established
by law. National laws and regulations should
specify the range, qualifying conditions and levels
of the benefits giving effect to these guarantees,
and provide for effective and accessible complaint
and appeal procedures.
Social protection floors correspond in many ways
to the notion of “core obligations”, namely the
obligation to ensure the realization of, at the very
least, minimum essential levels of rights embodied
in human rights treaties (UN 2012a; UN General
Assembly 2013).
Social protection programme/scheme (or
social security programme/scheme) Distinct
framework of rules to provide social protection
benefits to entitled beneficiaries. Such rules
specify the geographical and personal scope of
the programme (the target group), entitlement
conditions, the type of benefits provided, the
amounts of such benefits (cash transfers),
periodicity and other benefit characteristics,
as well as the financing (through contributions,

general t axation and /or other sources),
governance and administration of the programme.
While “programme” may refer to a wide range
of programmes, the term “scheme” is usually
used in a more specific sense referring to a
programme that is anchored in national legislation
and characterized by at least a certain degree
of formality.
A programme/scheme can be supported by one
or more social security institutions governing
the provision of benefits and their financing.
It should, in general, be possible to draw up a
separate account of receipts and expenditure for
each social protection programme. It is often the
case that a social protection programme provides
protection against a single risk or need, and covers
a single specific group of beneficiaries. Typically,
however, one institution will administer more than
one benefit programme.
Social security The fundamental right to social
security is set out in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (1948) and other international legal
instruments. The notion of social security adopted
here covers all measures providing benefits,
whether in cash or in kind, to secure protection
from, among other things:
X lack of work-related income (or insufficient

income) caused by sickness, disabilit y,
maternity, employment injury, unemployment,
old age, or death of a family member;

X lack of (affordable) access to healthcare;
X insufficient family support, particularly for

children and adult dependants; and

X general poverty and social exclusion.

Social security thus has two main (functional)
dimensions, namely “income security ” and
“availability of medical care”, reflected in the
Declaration of Philadelphia (1944), which forms
part of the ILO’s Constitution, in the following
terms: “social security measures to provide a
basic income to all in need of such protection and
comprehensive medical care”.4 Recommendation
No. 202 stipulates that, at least, access to

3

Recommendation No. 202, Para. 5.

4

Art. III(f). These two main dimensions are also identified in the ILO Income Security Recommendation, 1944 (No. 67),
and the Medical Care Recommendation, 1944 (No. 69), respectively, as “essential element[s] of social security”. These
Recommendations envisage that, first, “income security schemes should relieve want and prevent destitution by restoring,
up to a reasonable level, income which is lost by reason of inability to work (including old age) or to obtain remunerative
work or by reason of the death of a breadwinner” (Recommendation No. 67, Guiding principles, Para. 1); and, second, that
“a medical care service should meet the need of the individual for care by members of the medical and allied professions”
and “the medical care service should cover all members of the community” (Recommendation No. 69, Paras 1 and 8).
Recommendation No. 202 also reflects these two elements in the basic social protection guarantees that should form part of
national social protection floors (for more details, see box 1.1).

228 X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

essential healthcare and basic income security
over the life cycle should be guaranteed as part
of nationally defined social protection floors,
and that higher levels of protection should be
progressively achieved by national social security
systems in line with Convention No. 102 and other
ILO instruments.
Access to social security is essentially a public
responsibility, and is typically provided through
public ins titutions, f inanced from either
contributions or taxes or both. However, the
delivery of social security can be and often is
mandated to private entities. Moreover, there exist
many privately run institutions (of an insurance,
self-help, community-based or mutual character)
which can partially assume certain roles usually
played by social security (such as the operation
of occupational pension schemes) to complement
and perhaps largely take the place of elements of
public social security schemes. Entitlements
to social security are conditional either on the
payment of social security contributions for
prescribed periods (contributor y schemes,
most of ten structured as social insurance
arrangements) or on a requirement, sometimes
described as “residency plus”, under which
benefits are provided to all residents of the
country who also meet certain other criteria
(non-contributory schemes). Such criteria may
make benefit entitlements conditional on age,
health, labour market participation, income
or other determinants of social or economic
status and/or even conformity with certain
behavioural requirements.
Two main features distinguish social security
from other social arrangements. First, benefits
are provided to beneficiaries without any
simultaneous reciprocal obligation (thus it does
not, for example, represent remuneration for
work or other services delivered). Second, it is
not based on an individual agreement between
the protected person and the provider (as is, for
example, a life insurance contract); the agreement
applies to a wider group of people and thus has a
collective character.
Depending on the categor y of applicable
conditions, a distinction is also made between
non-means-tested schemes (where the conditions
of benefit entitlement are not related to the total
level of income or wealth of the beneficiary and
her or his family) and means-tested schemes

(where entitlement is granted only to those with
income or wealth below a prescribed threshold).
A special category of “conditional” schemes
includes those which, in addition to other
conditions, require beneficiaries (and/or their
relatives or families) to participate in prescribed
public programmes (for example, specified health
or educational programmes).
Social security system/social protection
system Totality of social security/protection
schemes and programmes in a country, taking
into account that the latter term is often used in a
broader sense than the former.
All the social security schemes and institutions
in a countr y are inevitably interlinked and
complementary in their objectives, functions and
financing, and thus form a national social security
system. For reasons of effectiveness and efficiency,
it is essential that there is close coordination within
the system, and that – not least for coordination
and planning purposes – the receipts and
expenditure accounts of all the schemes are
compiled into one social security budget for
the country so that its future expenditure and
financing of the schemes comprising the social
security system are planned in an integrated way.
Social transfer All social security benefits
comprise transfers either in cash or in kind: that
is, they represent a transfer of income, goods or
services (for example, healthcare services). This
transfer may be from the active to the old, the
healthy to the sick, or the affluent to the poor,
among others. The recipients of such transfers
may be in a position to receive them from a
specific social security scheme because they
have contributed to such a scheme (contributory
scheme), or because they are residents (universal
schemes for all residents), or because they fulfil
specific age criteria (categorical schemes) or meet
specific resource conditions (social assistance
schemes), or because they fulfil several of these
conditions at the same time. In addition, it is a
requirement in some schemes (employment
guarantee schemes, public employ ment
programmes) that beneficiaries accomplish
specific tasks or adopt specific behaviours
(conditional cash transfer programmes). In any
given country, several schemes of different
t ypes generally coexist and may provide
benefits for similar contingencies to different
population groups.

Annex 1. Glossary 229

Targeted scheme/programme See social
assistance scheme.
Universal scheme/categorical scheme Strictly
speaking, universal schemes provide benefits
under the single condition of residence. However,
the term is also often used to describe categorical
schemes, which provide benefits to certain broad
categories of the population without a means test
or a proxy means test. The most common forms
of such schemes are those that transfer income
to older people above a certain age, to all people
with disabilities, or to children below a certain age.
Some categorical schemes also target households
with specific structures (one-parent households,
for example) or occupational groups (such as rural
workers). Most categorical schemes are financed
by public resources.
Universal social protection refers to social
protection systems that ensure everyone has
access to comprehensive, adequate and sustain­
able protection over the life cycle, in line with ILO
standards. Achieving universal social protection
entails actions and measures to realize the human
right to social security by progressively building and
maintaining nationally appropriate social protection

systems. Rights-based social protection systems,
encompassing social protection floors and higher
levels of protection, guarantee that the rights and
obligations of all parties concerned – workers,
employers, governments, State institutions – are
anchored in law and duly observed to ensure
human well-being and a dignified life. The State
has primary responsibility for establishing
the legal and administrative architecture and
sustainable financing of social security, and is the
final guarantor of its proper administration and
good governance. Universal social protection is
crucial for the prevention and reduction of poverty,
inequalities and social exclusion, effectively
maintaining workers’ incomes and living standards.
In the context of covariate shocks and crises, it can
respond effectively, enabling access to healthcare
and stabilizing aggregate demand by support­
­ing income security and business continuity.
A universal social protection system bolsters
the social contract: as an investment in human
capabilities, decent work and inclusive economies,
it ensures the willingness of everyone to pay taxes
and make social contributions, thereby sustaining
the system and fostering social cohesion.

Measurement of effective coverage
for SDG indicator 1.3.1

This report provides a comprehensive data set for
the monitoring of SDG indicator 1.3.1, based on the
data compiled through the ILO SSI together with
other sources. The data set was submitted to the
United Nations Statistics Division in the framework
of SDG monitoring; in particular, in the context of
SDG 1 (“End poverty in all its forms everywhere”),
the ILO is responsible for producing estimates
on SDG indicator 1.3.1: “Proportion of population
covered by social protection floors/systems, by
sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons,
older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant
women, newborns, work-injury victims, and the
poor and the vulnerable”.
The indicator reflects the proportion of persons
effectively covered by social protection systems,
including social protection floors (for the definition
of “effective coverage” and how it is measured,
see below). It covers the main components of
social protection – child, family and maternity
benefits; support for people without jobs, people
with disabilities, victims of work injuries and
older people1 – with the aim of gauging progress
towards SDG target 1.3, and towards the goal of
providing at least a basic level of support in all the
main contingencies of the life cycle, as defined
in Recommendation No. 202. Health coverage,
although it is one of the four basic guarantees of
the social protection floor, is monitored not under
SDG indicator 1.3.1 but under SDG indicators 3.8.1
and 3.8.2 (see the definition of “effective coverage”
and criteria for its measurement in the next
section of this annex). Calculations include
separate indicators to distinguish effective
coverage of social protection cash benefits for
children, unemployed people, older people and
people with disabilities, pregnant women and

mothers with newborns, those who have suffered
injury at work, the poor and the vulnerable. For
each case, coverage is expressed as a proportion
of the respective population group. Effective
coverage for workers in the event of sickness,
although reflected in Recommendation No. 202,
is not included within SDG indicator 1.3.1.
Indicators are calculated as follows.2
(a) Proportion of the population covered by at least
one social protection cash benefit: Ratio of the
population receiving cash benefits3 under at
least one of the contingencies/social protection
functions (contributory or non-contributory
benefit) or actively contributing to at least one
social security scheme to the total population.
(b) Proportion of children covered by social protection
benefits: ratio of children/households receiving
child or family cash benefits to the total
number of children/households with children.
(c) Proportion of women giving birth covered by
maternity benefits: ratio of women receiving
cash maternity benefits to women giving
birth in the same year (estimated based on
age-specific fertility rates published in the UN’s
World Population Prospects or on the number of
live births, corrected for the share of twin and
triplet births).
(d) Proportion of persons with disabilities receiving
benefits: ratio of persons receiving disability
cash benef it s to per sons with severe
disabilities. The latter is calculated as the
product of prevalence of disability ratios
(published for each country group by the WHO)
and each country’s population.
(e) Proportion of unemployed receiving benefits: ratio
of recipients of unemployment cash benefits to
the number of unemployed persons.
(f) Proportion of workers covered in case of
employment injury: ratio of workers protected
by injury insurance to total employment or the
labour force.

Healthcare is included under other SDG indicators, such as those under SDG target 3.8.

(g) Proportion of older persons receiving a pension:
ratio of persons above statutory retirement
age receiving an old-age pension (including
contributory and non-contributory) to persons
above statutory retirement age.
(h) Proportion of vulnerable persons receiving
benefits: ratio of social assistance cash
benefits recipients to the total number of
vulnerable persons. The latter are calculated
by subtracting from total population all people
of working age who are contributing to a social
insurance scheme or receiving contributory
benefits, and all persons above retirement age
receiving contributory benefits.

Aggregate coverage indicators

Two aggregate measures of coverage are used in
this report: the first aggregate indicator reflects
legal coverage,4 the second effective coverage (for
more details, see below).
X The proportion of the population enjoying

comprehensive social security protection is
estimated based on the number of people of
working age who enjoy comprehensive legal
social security coverage, that is, are covered
by law in respect of eight areas (sickness,
unemployment, old age, employment injury,
child/family benefit, maternity, invalidity,
survivors) specified in Convention No. 102.5

X The proportion of the population covered

by at least one social protection cash benefit
(SDG indicator 1.3.1(a), see above) reflects the
effective coverage of the population in at least
one area,6 that is, the proportion of the total
population receiving contributory or noncontributory benefits in at least one area or
actively contributing to at least one social
security scheme.

Measuring social protection
coverage: Concepts and criteria

General considerations
Measuring social protection coverage is a complex
task. Several dimensions need to be considered in
order to arrive at a comprehensive assessment.

In practice, few countries have available the full
range of statistical data necessary for such a
comprehensive assessment of social security
coverage; nevertheless, partial information is
available for a large number of countries. Many
countries have acknowledged the need to
undertake better regular monitoring of social
security coverage and are stepping up their
efforts to improve data collection and analysis;
the SDG agenda, and especially targets 1.3 and
3.8, have been instrumental in encouraging
this work.
Social security coverage is a multidimensional
concept with at least three dimensions:
X Scope. This is measured by the range (number)

and type of social security areas (branches) to
which the population of the country has access.
Population groups with differing status in the
labour market may enjoy different scopes of
coverage, and this factor must be taken into
account in assessing overall scope.

X Extent. This usually refers to the percentage

of people covered within the whole population
or the target group (as defined by, for example,
gender, age, income level or labour market
status) by social security measures in each
specific area.

X Level. This refers to the adequacy of coverage

in a specific branch of social security. It may
be measured by the level of cash benefits
provided, where measurements of benefit
levels can be either absolute or relative to
selected benchmark values such as previous
incomes, average incomes, the poverty line
and so on. For health benefits, it is measured
as the range of health services covered and
the level of financial protection (support
value) provided in relation to those services.
Measures of quality are usually relative, and
may be objective or subjective – for example,
the satisfaction of beneficiaries as compared
with their expectations would be a subjective
measure.

In measuring coverage, a distinction is made
between legal coverage and effective coverage
in each of the above three dimensions, so as
to reflect different dimensions of coverage.
Table A2.1 summarizes these various dimensions.

4

Legal coverage is sometimes referred to as “statutory coverage”, taking into account that provisions may be rooted in
statutory provisions other than laws.

5

Access to healthcare is not included.

6

Excluding sickness benefits and access to healthcare.

Scope

Which social security areas are
anchored in the national legislation?

In which areas is social security provision actually
implemented?

For a given group of the population:
for which social security area(s) is
this group covered according to the
national legislation?

For a given group of the population: for which
social security areas is this group effectively
covered (benefits actually being available)?

Extent

For a given social security area
(branch): which categories of the
population are covered according
to the national legislation? What
percentage of the population or
labour force is covered according to
the national legislation?

For a given social security area (branch): which
categories of the population enjoy actual access to
benefits in case of need (currently or in the future)?
The “beneficiary coverage ratio”: for a given social
security area, what percentage of the population
affected by the contingency receives benefits or
services (e.g. percentage of older persons receiving
an old-age pension; percentage of unemployed
receiving unemployment benefits)?
The “contributor coverage ratio”: for a given social
security area, what percentage of the population
contributes to the scheme, or is otherwise insured
by the scheme, and can thus expect to receive
benefits when needed (e.g. percentage of workingage population or of the labour force contributing
to a pension scheme)?
By extension, the “protected person
coverage ratio” would include people who,
in the future – assuming that legislation is
unchanged – would be entitled to a health benefit
(as a service user, beneficiary, contributor or
dependant, according to the type of national
system) or a non-contributory cash benefit,
through either a universal scheme or a meanstested scheme, provided they meet the eligibility
criteria.

Level

For a given social security area: what
is the level of protection provided
according to the national legislation?
For cash benefits: what is the
prescribed amount or replacement
rate according to the national
legislation?
For healthcare benefits: what is the
prescribed health package and level
of co-payment, if any?

Source: Based on ILO (2010).

For a given social security area: what is the level of
protection actually provided (e.g. for cash benefits,
average level of benefit as a proportion of median
income, minimum wage or poverty line; for health
benefits, effective use of services and level of
financial protection (affordability))?

Annex 2. Measuring social protection coverage and expenditure 233

Legal coverage
Estimates of the scope of legal coverage usually
measure the number of social security areas
(branches) by which – according to existing
national legislation – a population or specific
groups within it is or are covered. The list of the
nine branches covered by ILO Convention No. 102
is used as guidance.
Estimates of the extent of legal coverage use both
information on the groups covered by statutory
schemes for a given social security area (branch)
in national legislation and available statistical
information quantifying the number of people
concerned at the national level. A population
group can be identified as legally covered in a
specific social security area (for example, old
age, unemployment protection, maternit y
protection) if the existing legislation sets out
that this group is mandatorily covered by social
insurance, or that the group will be entitled to
specified non-contributory benefits under certain
circumstances – for instance, to an old-age state
pension on reaching the age of 65, or to income
support if income falls below a specified threshold.
A legal coverage ratio for a given branch of social
security is the ratio between the estimated
number of people legally covered and – as
appropriate – the labour force or working-age
population in the relevant age range. For example,
since Convention No. 102 allows a ratifying country
to provide coverage through social insurance,
through universal or means-tested benefits, or
through a combination of these, it also formulates
alternatives to minimum requirements for the
extent of coverage, as follows:
(a) prescribed classes of employees, constituting
not less than 50 per cent of all employees; or
(b) prescribed classes of the economically active
population, constituting not less than 20 per
cent of all residents; or
(c) all residents whose means during the
contingency do not exceed prescribed limits.
The level of legal coverage for specific branches
of social security is usually measured for cash
benefits by benefit ratios or replacement
ratios calculated for specified categories of
beneficiaries, using benefit formulas or benefit
amounts specified in the legislation. For example,
Convention No. 102 sets minimum replacement
rates for cash benefits in seven of the nine
specified branches (see tables in Annex 3 below).
It stipulates that such minimum rates should
apply to a defined “standard” beneficiary meeting

qualifying conditions, and be guaranteed at least
to those with earnings up to a certain prescribed
selected level. For healthcare benefits, the extent
of the prescribed benefit package is necessarily a
qualitative indicator against the main components
of a comprehensive package as defined in ILO
standards, including promotive, preventive,
curative and rehabilitative care. The extent of
healthcare provision that can be accessed also
needs to be stipulated in legislation. The level
of co-payment is measured in percentage of
the costs of care left to the patient to cover out
of pocket. Currently, data on legal provisions
for benefit packages and financial protection
are not collected systematically or in a uniform
fashion across regions, and therefore could not
be reported in this edition of the World Social
Protection Report.

Effective coverage
Measurements of effective coverage should reflect
how the legal provisions are implemented in
reality. Effective coverage is usually different from
(and usually lower than) legal coverage because
of non‑compliance, problems with enforcement
of legal provisions, or other deviations of actual
policies from the text of the legislation. In order
to arrive at a full coverage assessment, measures
of legal and effective coverage need to be used
in parallel.
Measurements of the scope of effective coverage
in a country reveal the number of social security
areas (branches) for which there is relevant
legislation that is actually enforced: in other
words, whether in all such areas the majority of
the population legally covered are also effectively
covered (as measured by the extent of effective
coverage; see below).
When measuring the ex tent of ef fec tive
coverage, a distinction has to be made between
measurement in terms of protected persons and
in terms of actual beneficiaries. Protected persons
are those who have benefits guaranteed but are
not necessarily currently receiving them – for
example, people who contribute to a pension
scheme are protected, but not yet receiving a
pension. Similarly, people affiliated to a healthcare
scheme are effectively protected, although they
receive the benefit only when they have a specific
health need (e.g. immunization, injury, illness).
In respect of protected persons, the contributor
coverage ratio reflects, in the case of contributory
schemes, the number of those protected should
they be affected by the contingency covered, now

234 X World Social Protection Report 2020–22: Social protection at the crossroads – in pursuit of a better future

or in the future: that is, the share of the employed
population (or alternatively the population of
working age or in the labour force) who contribute
directly or indirectly to social insurance in a
given social security area and are thus likely to
receive benefits when needed. An example is the
percentage of employed people contributing to a
pension scheme. The protected person coverage
ratio includes all people entitled to benefits (both
contributory and non-contributory), assuming
no change to legislation. For health benefits,
even in contributory schemes, the protection
granted usually extends to the dependants
of the contributor; hence, for healthcare
benefits, the protected persons coverage ratio
represents the percentage of the population
protected by a scheme, regardless of whether
they are contributing or not. The proportion of the
population protected by social health protection
(figure 4.43) reflects this methodology.7
In respect of actual beneficiaries, the beneficiary
coverage ratio describes the proportion of the
population affected by a certain contingency (such
as older people or the unemployed) who actually
benefit from the appropriate social protection
benefits (in these examples, old-age pensions or
unemployment benefits). This ratio reflects the
number of those actually receiving benefits, for
example the number of recipients of any pension
benefits among all residents over the statutory
pensionable age, or the number of beneficiaries
of some kind of income support among all those
unemployed, or all below the poverty line. For
healthcare benefits and sickness cash benefits,
measurement of actual benefit provision in
relation to the occurrence of such contingencies
is challenging, and there is no consensus on the
optimal methodology to capture these dimensions
of coverage.

Measurements of the level of effective coverage
aim to identify the levels of benefits (usually
related to certain benchmark amounts or benefit
packages) actually received by beneficiaries, such
as unemployment benefits or pensions paid,
compared to average earnings or the minimum
wage or the poverty line. In the case of contributory
pension schemes, the effective level of benefit may
also relate to future (potential) benefit levels. In the
case of healthcare, SDG indicator 3.8.1 is an index
by which to measure effective access to a range of
health services and infrastructure in times of need
by a given national population (WHO and World
Bank 2017).8 When it comes to the level of financial
protection afforded when effectively accessing
health services, there is an international consensus
on the use of OOP payments made by households
on healthcare and its impact on poverty as a proxy
indicator for the lack of financial protection, as
reflected in SDG indicator 3.8.2 (WHO and World
Bank 2017).
When assessing coverage and gaps in coverage,
three types of schemes need to be distinguished,
namely: (1) contributor y social insurance;
(2) universal schemes covering all residents (or
all residents in a given category);9 and (3) meanstested schemes potentially covering all those who
pass the required test of income and/or assets.
In the case of social insurance it makes sense to
look at the numbers of those who are actually
members of and contributors to such schemes,
and who thus potentially enjoy – sometimes with
their dependants – coverage in the event of any of
the contingencies covered by their social insurance.
These people fall into a category of persons
“protected” in the event of a given contingency. The
concept of protected persons may also apply where
people are covered by universal or categorical
programmes if all residents, or all residents in a
given category (for example, a certain age range),
are entitled to certain benefits or to free access

7

This represents the best estimate of people protected by a healthcare scheme for their primary coverage. Mechanisms
include national health insurance; social health insurance mandated by the State (including subsidized coverage for the
poor); national healthcare services guaranteed without charge or with small copayments; and other programmes (user fee
waivers, vouchers, etc.). In all, 189 schemes for primary coverage were identified and included. To avoid overlaps, only public
or publicly mandated privately administered primary healthcare schemes were included. Supplementary and voluntary
public and private programmes were not included, with the sole exception of the United States (the only country in the world
where private health insurance plays a significant role in primary coverage).
Multiple sources were combined for this indicator, including data from the ILO SSI and the OECD Health Statistics 2020
database, national administrative data published in official reports, and information from regular national surveys of target
populations on awareness on rights. Data were collected for 117 countries and territories representing 89% of the world’s
population.

The additional indicators displayed in this report on health service use and availability are sourced from the WHO Global
Health Observatory (methodology and metadata accessible at: https://www.who.int/data/gho), while indicators on the
health workforce are calculated using labour force survey data from the ILO–OECD–WHO Working for Health Programme
(https://working4health.org/).

to social services by law and in practice in the
event of the given contingency. It is, however,
rather difficult to specify who is in fact effectively
protected in the case of benefits granted on the
basis of a means test or proxy means test, or in the
form of conditional cash transfers.
The above measures of extent and level of
coverage are specifically applied to certain areas
(branches) of social security (and sometimes even
only to specific schemes or types of scheme); they
do not attempt to provide a generic measure of
social security coverage. Ensuring the specificity
of coverage indicators by area is essential to
arrive at a meaningful analysis and ensure its
relevance for policy development. In the case of
healthcare benefits, the level of benefit coverage
needs to encompass both the extent of services
used in practice and the financial protection
awarded against the costs of healthcare. SDG
indicators 3.8.1 (service coverage) and 3.8.2
(catastrophic expenditure on health) are used as
proxies to monitor the level of effective coverage
along those two dimensions.

Social protection expenditure
Data on social protection expenditure are collected
according to different standards around the
world. Within the European Union the standard
is the European System of Integrated Social
Protection Statistics (ESSPROS) system, while
comparable data for other parts of the world are
available through the IMF’s Government Finance
Statistics (GFS), according to either the GFS 2014
standard, or the older GFS 2001 or 1986 standards.
Figures on social protection expenditure are
presented both including and excluding general
government expenditure on health (GGHE), with
a view to disaggregating cash and care benefits.
The source for GGHE is the WHO’s Global Health
Expenditure Database.10
Data on expenditure for this report were obtained
from various sources (see table A2.2).

Expenditure on social protection
Expenditure on social protection includes: social benefits,
administration costs (which represent the costs charged
to the scheme for its management and administration)
and other expenditure (miscellaneous expenditure by
social protection schemes, principally payment of property
income).

Sickness/healthcare
benefits (including paid sick
leave, medical care and the
provision of pharmaceutical
products); disability,
old‑age, survivors’,
family and children,
unemployment, housing
and social exclusion (social
assistance) benefits.

Expenditure on social protection
Social expenditure comprises cash benefits, direct in-kind
provision of goods and services, and tax breaks with
social purposes. Benefits may be targeted at low-income
households, the elderly, disabled, sick, unemployed, or
young people. To be considered “social”, programmes
have to involve either redistribution of resources across
households or compulsory participation. Social benefits
are classified as public when general government (that
is, central, state and local governments, including social
security funds) controls the relevant financial flows. All
social benefits not provided by general government are
considered private. Private transfers between households
are not considered as “social” and not included here.

Old-age, survivors’,
incapacity-related and
family benefits; ALMPs;
unemployment and
housing benefits; and
benefits in other social
policy areas.

Expenditure on health
Health spending measures the final consumption
of healthcare goods and services (i.e. current health
expenditure) including personal healthcare (curative care,
rehabilitative care, long-term care, ancillary services and
medical goods) and collective services (prevention and
public health services as well as health administration),
but excluding spending on investments. Healthcare
is financed through a mix of financing arrangements
including government spending and compulsory health
insurance (“government/compulsory”) as well as voluntary
health insurance and private funds such as households’
OOP payments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
and private corporations (“voluntary”).

to social security and extra-budgetary funds). It includes
all expenditure made by these entities, regardless of the
source, so includes any donor funding passing through
them. It includes transfer payments to households to
offset medical care costs, extra-budgetary funds to
finance health services and goods, and both current and
capital expenditure.

Estimating global and regional
aggregates of social protection
indicators: Methodological
description

The global and regional estimates presented in
this report are based on econometric models
designed to impute missing data in countries for
which nationally reported data are unavailable.
The output of the models is a complete set of
single-year estimates for eight social protection
indicators for 186 countries. The country-level
data (reported and imputed) are then aggregated
to produce global and regional estimates of the
social protection indicators.

Data coverage
Input data utilized in the model were collected
through the ILO Social Security Inquiry (SSI). The
number of countries for which data were reported
for each variable included in the global and
regional estimations is as follows: overall coverage
by social protection (at least one contingency),
161 countries; older persons, 174 countries;
persons with severe disabilities, 133 countries;
mothers with newborns, 149 countries; children,
118 countries; unemployed, 165 countries;
vulnerable population, 141 countries; employment
injury, 149 countries. Detailed information on the
share of the global and regional populations for
which data were reported to the ILO through the
SSI is provided in table A2.7 for each indicator. The
years of the input data range from 2016 to 2020.

Description of the econometric model
Separate models are run for each social protection
indicator for which regional and global aggregates
are generated. The indicators generally utilize
ordinary least squares (OLS) models for esti­
mation using reported coverage for the given
social protection scheme, geographical location
and GDP per capita as explanatory variables.
Additionally, the estimation for aggregate social
protection coverage (at least one contingency)
uses estimated coverage for older persons as an
explanatory variable. This estimation of overall
coverage is also used as an explanatory variable
for the rest of the indicators.
The dependent variable in each model is the
proportion of the population covered under the
given social protection scheme in a country (i),
and the independent variables are regional
groupings, log GDP per capita, and an auxiliary
coverage variable to enhance the information set
if applicable, as shown in equation (1):

Social protection indicator (i) =
α + β(Region i) + ln(GDP per capita i)
+ µ(Auxiliary Coverage Variable i) + εi

(1)

The Auxiliary Coverage Variable is the estimated
coverage for older persons when the dependent
variable is aggregate social protection coverage.
Similarly, the Auxiliary Coverage Variable used
for the remaining indicators is the estimated
overall social protection coverage. No auxiliary
variable is used in coverage for older persons as
it is the indicator with the highest data availability.
The few cases where OLS estimates were out of
range (<0% or >100% coverage) were replaced
by simple averages across World Bank country
income groups.

Latin America and the Caribbean
Northern Africa
Northern America
Northern, Southern and Western Europe
South-Eastern Asia and the Pacific

Sub-Saharan Africa
Note: Regional groupings in the regression are based
on the ILO classification of geographical subregions.

As the old-age coverage indicator has significantly
greater data coverage than the other indicators,
simple regional averages of the reported old-age
coverage data were used to impute values in
countries without data. In the few cases where
the OLS estimates were out of range (<0% or
>100% coverage), these were replaced by simple
regional averages.

Method of producing global and regional
aggregates
The regional and global aggregates are obtained
by weighted averages of the underlying
country-level estimates (reported or imputed).
Country-level estimates were not used in the
production of global and regional aggregates of
employment injury coverage, which were based
solely on reported data. The weights used for each
indicator are listed in table A2.6.

Database are collected through the ILO SSI, the
ILO’s periodic collection of administrative data
from national ministries of labour, social security,
welfare, social development, finance and other
areas. The SSI questionnaires and manual are
available online.
For measuring legal coverage, the main source is
the ISSA/SSA Social Security Programs Throughout
the World, used in combination with labour force
data from ILOSTAT.
Other data sources include the following.
X For indicators of effective coverage: existing

global social protection statistics, including
those of Eurostat, the World Bank pensions
and ASPIRE databases, UNICEF, UN Women,
HelpAge, OECD and ISSA.

X For indicators of legal coverage: HelpAge

International, and the Mutual Information
System on Social Protection (MISSOC).

X For coverage in health: WHO Global Health

Expenditure Database Data Repository; UN,
World Population Prospects, 2019 revision;
World Bank, World Development Indicators
and Global Consumption Database.

X For indicators on expenditure: the GDP data

used are current GDP in US$ according to
the World Bank; data on expenditure from
the International Monetar y Fund (IMF),
Eurostat, OECD, UN Economic Commission
for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC),
Asian Development Bank (ADB), Government
Spending Watch (GSW), WHO and national
sources such as ministries of finance and/or
economics.

X For population and labour market indicators:

ILOSTAT; UN, World Population Prospects, 2019
revision. Definitions used for these indicators
are available in the Resolution concerning
statistics of work, employment and labour
underutilization, 19th International Conference
of Labour Statisticians (ICLS), October 2013.12

X The ILO World Social Protection Database also

draws on national official reports and other
sources (which usually are largely based on
administrative data) and on survey data from a
range of sources including national household
income and expenditure surveys, labour force
surveys, and demographic and health surveys,
to the extent that these include variables on
social protection.

Where new data from the above-mentioned
sources were not available, data from previous
editions of the World Social Protection Report
were used.

11

The data are disseminated through the ILO World Social Protection Data dashboards (https://www.social-protection.org/
gimi/WSPDB.action?id=32) with interactive graphs, maps and tables.

Annex 3. Minimum requirements
in ILO social security standards

ILO social security standards have come to be
recognized globally as key references for the
design of rights-based, sound and sustainable
social protection schemes and systems. They
also give meaning and definition to the content
of the right to social security as laid down in
international human rights instruments (notably
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948,
and the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights, 1966), thereby
constituting essential tools for the realization
of this right and the effective implementation
of a rights-based approach to social protection.
Guiding ILO policy and technical advice in the field
of social protection, ILO social security standards
are primarily tools for governments which, in
consultation with employers and workers, are
seeking to draft and implement social security law,
establish administrative and financial governance
frameworks, and develop social protection
policies. More specifically, these standards serve
as key references for:
X the elaboration of national social security
extension strategies;
X the development and maintenance of
comprehensive national social securit y
systems;
X the design and parametric adjustment of social
security schemes;
X the establishment and implementation
of ef fective recourse, enforcement and
compliance mechanisms;
X the good governance of social security and
improvement of administrative and financial
structures;
X the realization of international and regional
obligations, and the operationalization of
national social protection strategies and action
plans; and
X working towards the achievement of the SDGs,
particularly Goals 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 16.
The ILO’s normative social security framework
consists of eight up-to-date Conventions and
1

nine Recommendations.1 The most prominent of
these are the Social Security (Minimum Standards)
Convention, 1952 (No. 102), and the Social
Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202).
Other Conventions and Recommendations set
higher standards in respect of the different social
security branches, or spell out the social security
rights of migrant workers. ILO standards establish
qualitative and quantitative benchmarks which
together determine the minimum standards of
social security protection to be provided by social
security schemes in certain life contingencies, with
regard to:
X the definition of the contingency (what risk or
life circumstance must be covered?);
X the individuals protected (who must be
covered?);
X the type and level of benefits (what should be
provided?);
X any entitlement conditions, including any
qualifying period (what should a person do to
get the right to a benefit?); and
X the duration of benefit and any waiting period
(how long must the benefit be paid/provided
for, and when must it commence?).
In addition, they set out common rules of collective
organization, financing and management of
social security, as well as principles for the good
governance of national systems. These include:
X the general responsibility of the State for
the due provision of benefits and proper
administration of social security systems;
X solidarity, collective financing and risk-pooling;
X participatory management of social security
schemes;
X guarantee of defined benefits;
X adjustment of pensions in payment to maintain
the purchasing power of beneficiaries; and
X the right to complain and appeal.
Tables A3.1–9 provide a summary overview
of some of the key requirements set out in
ILO standards.

Notes
… Data not available.
* To be interpreted with caution: estimates based on reported data coverage below 40% of the population.
1

Proportion of the population covered by at least one social protection cash benefit: ratio of the population
receiving cash benefits, excluding healthcare and sickness benefits, under at least one of the contingencies/
social protection functions (contributory or non-contributory benefit) or actively contributing to at least one social
security scheme to the total population.

2

Proportion of children covered by social protection benefits: ratio of children/households receiving child or family
cash benefits to the total number of children/households with children.

3

Proportion of women giving birth covered by maternity benefits: ratio of women receiving cash maternity benefits
to women giving birth in the same year (estimated based on age-specific fertility rates published in the UN’s World
Population Prospects or on the number of live births corrected for the share of twin and triplet births).

4

Proportion of persons with disabilities receiving benefits: ratio of persons receiving disability cash benefits to
persons with severe disabilities. The latter is calculated as the product of prevalence of disability ratios (published
for each country group by the WHO) and each country’s population.

5

Proportion of unemployed receiving benefits: ratio of recipients of unemployment cash benefits to the number
of unemployed persons.

6

Proportion of workers covered in case of employment injury: ratio of workers protected by injury insurance to
total employment or the labour force.

7

Proportion of older persons receiving a pension: ratio of persons above statutory retirement age receiving an
old-age pension (including contributory and non-contributory) to persons above statutory retirement age.

8

Proportion of vulnerable persons receiving benefits: ratio of social assistance cash benefits recipients to the total
number of vulnerable persons. The latter are calculated by subtracting from total population all people of working
age who are contributing to a social insurance scheme or receiving contributory benefits, and all persons above
retirement age receiving contributory benefits.

9

Proportion of the labour force actively contributing to a pension scheme: ratio of workers protected by pension
scheme (active contributors) to the total labour force.

10

Coverage of essential health services (defined as the average coverage of essential services based on tracer
interventions that include reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases and service capacity and access, among the general and the most disadvantaged
population).

Global and regional aggregates are weighted by relevant population groups. Estimates are not strictly comparable
to 2016 regional estimates due to methodological enhancements, extended data availability and country revisions.
For detailed definition of the indicators, please see Annex 2, available at: https://wspr.social-protection.org.

Notes
… Data not available.
a

Total social protection expenditure (excluding health) does not always correspond to the sum of expenditures
by age group, depending on data availability, source and year, and on inclusion of non-age-group-specific
expenditures.

b

Including social security funds.

c

Excluding social security funds.

Global and regional aggregates are weighted by GDP. Estimates are not strictly comparable to 2016 regional estimates
due to methodological enhancements, extended data availability and country revisions.
For detailed definition of the indicators, please see Annex 2, available at: https://wspr.social-protection.org.

Advancing social justice,
promoting decent work
The International Labour
Organization is the United
Nations agency for the world
of work. We bring together
governments, employers and
workers to drive a human-centred
approach to the future of work
through employment creation,
rights at work, social protection
and social dialogue.

This ILO flagship report provides a global overview of recent
developments in social protection systems, including social
protection floors, and covers the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. Based on new data, it offers a broad range of global,
regional and country data on social protection coverage,
benefits and public expenditures on social protection.
Following a life-cycle approach, the report analyses progress
with regard to universal social protection coverage, with a
particular focus on achieving the globally agreed 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). The report includes access to comprehensive
statistical tables containing the latest social protection data,
including detailed country data on SDG indicator 1.3.1.
This report is published in conjunction with five regional
companion reports which highlight key developments,
challenges and priorities in the field of social protection in
Africa, the Arab States, Asia and the Pacific, Central and Eastern
Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean.
