Preface
This is a reprint of the Social Protection Strategy (SPS) of the Asian Development Bank, approved in 13 September 2001. Social protection is a key
step in ADB's battle to have Asia and the Pacific region "free of poverty."
The SPS spells out the scope of social protection and commitment of the
ADB to develop priority interventions in five major elements:
•

labor market policies and programs designed to generate employment,
improve working conditions and promote the efficient operations;

•

social insurance programs to cushion the risks associated with unemployment, ill health, disability, work-related injury and old age;

•

social assistance and welfare service programs for the vulnerable
groups with inadequate means of support, including single mothers,
the homeless, or physically or mentally challenged people;

•

micro and area-based schemes to address vulnerability at the community level, including microinsurance, agricultural insurance, social
funds and programs to manage natural disasters; and

•

child protection to ensure the healthy and productive development of
children.

Implementation of the SPS has started making significant progress and
can be seen at the ADB web site (http://www.adb.org/socialprotection/). The
first annual Progress Report can be accessed at http://www.adb.org/Documents/Reports/ Social_Protection/IN252-02.pdf. Comments and suggestions

I. Introduction

1.
Social protection is defined as the set of policies and programs
designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labor
markets, diminishing people’s exposure to risks, and enhancing their
capacity to protect themselves against hazards and interruption/loss of
income.1 Social protection consists of five major elements: (i) labor markets, (ii) social insurance, (iii) social assistance, (iv) micro and area-based
schemes to protect communities and (v) child protection. When implemented properly, these policies and programs can make a major contribution to the overarching goal of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of
reducing poverty. Social protection,

“Social safety net” and “social security” are sometimes used as an alternative to “social
protection.” Of the two terms, “social protection” is the most commonly used internationally. The term “social safety net” appears to have a less precise meaning; some people use
it to mean the whole set of programs and policies discussed in this strategy, others use it to
refer only to welfare programs targeted to the poor. On the other hand, the term “social
security” is generally used to refer to the comprehensive mechanisms and coverage in
high-income countries, and is less applicable to new areas such as community and areabased schemes.

(i)

The countries affected by the Southeast Asia crisis have discovered
that inadequate and underdeveloped social protection systems have
exposed their working populations to excessive risk, increased the
incidence of poverty, and threatened to undermine longer term human
capital investment efforts.

(ii)

Transition economies are discovering that the comprehensive social
protection systems they traditionally maintained have become too
expensive to sustain, are poorly designed for a market economy, and
create barriers to further economic development.

(iii) Modernization has been accompanied by a process of social mobility,
migration, urbanization, and disintegration of family and community
networks. Household informal safety nets are no longer adequate—
modernization requires the provision of social protection systems for
the workforce to ensure higher productivity gains, increased domestic demand, and economic growth.
(iv) Globalization, while increasing the opportunities for growth, will also
increase the risks of future macroeconomic shocks. As unemployment
and poverty result from economic downturns, the adequacy of social
protection and assured future progress in social development are
issues in the forefront of the development agenda of many DMCs.
3.
Different kinds of reforms and policies are needed in different economies. Where social protection systems have become too expensive and
are no longer appropriate to serve a country’s vulnerable populations, they
need to be restructured and consolidated. Where these systems are inadequate to deal with the major risks faced by rural and urban populations,
social protection needs to be extended and expanded. The vision of the
ADB’s Social Protection Strategy (SPS) is the provision of social protection
to all citizens of the Asia and Pacific region through the development of
sustainable, statutory programs with universal coverage to effectively assist
DMCs to reduce poverty, achieve growth by enhancing productivity, and
create opportunities for individual self-reliance.
4.
This strategy paper reflects three years of research and consultations
at ADB and its DMCs, to build strategies for effective social protection for
the Asia and Pacific region. The paper begins with a discussion of the social
protection needs in Asia and the Pacific, the components of social protection, the social protection systems in the region, and the work of ADB and
other development agencies. It then focuses on the criteria that might be
2

used to prioritize social protection interventions in a determined DMC. Social
protection policies will vary from one country to another owing to variations in needs, available resources, institutions, and the political economy
of reforms. Once a specific intervention is chosen, or a mix of them, selected
programs will have to attend to critical principles such as coverage, targeting of vulnerable populations, sustainability, good governance, and institutional and political capacity for reforms, this topic is explored next. The
paper ends with the recommendations to ensure proper implementation
of this Social Protection Strategy in ADB’s DMCs.

II. Overview of social
protection
A. Social risks and social protection
5.
The Asian and Pacific region has half the world’s population. Of the
total 3.1 billion, 900 million are poor (30%), and 1.2 billion are children and
youth (40%). Thus, a main development challenge for the region is to achieve
sufficient sustainable growth to secure the inclusion of the poor and young
new entrants in the development process. However, growth alone is not a
sufficient condition for generating inclusive societies. Populations, households, and individuals face various risks that can plunge them into poverty,
so societies have to take steps to reduce their vulnerability and to cope with
the effects when shocks occur. Risks may include natural disasters; civil
conflicts; economic downturns, of which the 1997 Asian financial crisis is
the most recent example; or idiosyncratic household reversals, such as crop
failures, unemployment, illness, accident, disability, death, and old age,
threatening the future of the household and its members. Development
interventions may themselves create new vulnerability and risks through
involuntary effects such as less affordable goods and services, temporary
job loss, loss of common property, displacement, and loss of community
support networks and social capital.
6.
Generally, four main types of risk to the poor can be identified: (i) those
related to the individual lifecycle, (ii) economic, (iii) environmental and
(iv) social/governance related (Table 1). Some risks affect all population
groups equally; others have more intense impacts on the poor. The poor
are highly vulnerable to risks and are constantly preoccupied with risk-averse
and coping strategies to avoid sinking further into poverty. Social risk is a
dynamic concept—insecurity means exposure to risks of events that if they
occur, result in further vulnerability. While anyone can be vulnerable, the
poor and the near poor are particularly at risk since they have fewer assets,
reserves, or other opportunities to fall back on.

7.
There are many risk reduction mechanisms, formal and informal, public and private sector delivered. Table 1 shows some of the informal strategies to cope with risk; many rely on community arrangements and women’s
support. However, as urbanization and industrialization gradually undermine the effectiveness of traditional and informal protection mechanisms,
new public and/or private systems need to be put in place to reduce risks to
the population. Social protection presents a variety of instruments to deal
with the diversification of most of these risks. The long-term solution to
vulnerability depends on good social and economic development decisions
that address the structural causes of vulnerability. Development policies
should therefore (i) involve proactive interventions to reduce vulnerability
and support populations to overcome poverty; and (ii) try not to alter existing informal family and community-based mechanisms to cope with risk,
given that these provide a level of social protection to the population, and
when possible, encourage community-driven interventions (social funds,
microinsurance, etc).3
8.
The large variety of risks is not addressed through social protection
alone. Social protection is not the entirety of development activities. Social
protection instruments are generally not considered for risk reduction; for
this, other instruments are available. Sound development policies and
investments are ways to reduce the probability of or even eliminate such
risks (e.g., infrastructure investment for flood control). Social protection programs are built primarily to mitigate the impacts of shocks or to help people
cope with risks if they occur. The boundaries between social protection
and related activities are somewhat arbitrary and have to take account of
regional characteristics and practical links to distinct and well-established
disciplines such as education, health, and agriculture. With these considerations in mind, ADB has developed a definition of social protection based
on labor markets and small-scale agriculture, in line with ADB’s overarching
goal of reducing poverty in the Asia and Pacific region.

B. Characteristics of the Asia and Pacific region
9.
Asia is a largely young, rural, and poor continent: social protection
programs and policies should be built to respond to Asia’s needs. The Asia
and Pacific region does not have adequate protection systems in place to

However, attention should be paid to possible negative interactions with other development policies—for instance, maintaining the responsibility of informal family welfare on
women limits women’s capacity to develop in other social and economic areas.

reduce the impact of shocks on its population; as a result, risks will continue to have devastating implications for poverty, inequality, and the prospects of long-term growth. Social protection schemes should be planned
on the basis of a thorough assessment of needs across the entire range and
the costs of meeting them in the short, medium, and long term in a sustainable manner. Demographic trends have important implications for this process. The Asia and Pacific region is still experiencing the effects of the
demographic explosion; the total population is 3.1 billion, of which 40% are
children and youth. Figures 1 to 4 reflect the most pronounced general effects. The demographic transition has started in Asia with a progressive
decrease in the number of infants and a progressive increase in the elderly.
However, the major issue in the years 2000–2015 will be the predominance
of children and the young new entrants into the labor market. In 2000, 30%
of the population was below 14, which is projected to fall to 25% by 2015,
still a remarkably high proportion. According to the international definition
of children (0–18), this group comprised as much as 40% of the total population in 2000, and is expected to decline to 34% in 2015.4 This has clear
implications for education, health, population, child protection, and labor
market policies for the realization of human potential and the creation of
opportunities for self-reliance to transform the vicious cycle of poverty into
a virtuous cycle of growth and human development.
10. In contrast to the developed regions and the industrialized countries
in Asia, people over 65 comprise only about 5.5% of the total population of
developing Asia. This percentage is expected to rise gradually to 7.2% by
2015 as fertility rates fall and life expectancy increases.5 At present, older
people in Asia reside primarily in rural areas, but with urbanization trends
the percentage of older people living in rural areas is expected to decrease.
Moreover, the decrease in the percentage of older persons living in extended
families will leave more elderly living alone thus forcing them to look for
assistance for housing and living standards from governments and NGOs.
Policy makers will need to plan for labor market and other social assistance
and social insurance schemes. The considerable size of the workforce combined with decreasing fertility rates could indicate that the Asian countries

targets (set by 2015), and (ii) ADB’s long-term strategic framework. Detailed tables can be
found in Appendix 2.
East Asia has a more pronounced aging pattern compared to the other three Asian subregions due to the effects of aging in the People’s Republic of China, where the proportion
of the population aged 65 and over is expected to reach 9.3% by 2015.

will likely face serious old-age challenges in 25 to 30 years, as the dependency ratios will be negatively affected. However, old-age policies should
not be precipitated but carefully evaluated; the fact that most of the population remain children and working age people allows many policy design
options. Short-term priorities remain addressing the urgent social issues of
supporting children and poverty reduction.
11. More than 60% of the population in Asia lives in rural areas. Most of
the poverty in the region is also rural-based, although urban poverty is
increasing. About 900 million people, 30% of the population of the Asia and
Pacific region, are poor. More women than men live in poverty and poverty
is increasingly a condition found among older persons. Social divisions of a
class, caste, ethnic, or racial nature are often intensified by differing poverty levels; and recently arrived immigrants tend to be poorer than others.
Further, the high levels of poverty in Asia constrain the expansion of traditional social protection instruments given that these
products are not affordable or

instance, old-age insurance.
12. The new century starts with profound changes. Globalization is shifting trade, capital, technology and information flows, changing values and
social structures. The increased opportunities resulting from access to new
ideas, goods, services, and technology are also accompanied by increasing
risks. Interdependence may lead to possible economic shocks and
downturns; if no social policies and safety nets are in place, countries may
experience mounting unemployment, poverty, marginalization, and political conflict. Most of the political opposition to globalization is due to the
absence of adequate transitional compensation systems, which makes
implementation of reforms very difficult given that populations may have
to pay the costs of reform in the short term. Globalization requires the
development of effective social protection systems in both developed and
developing countries. The world’s forward-looking development agenda
gives social protection a primary role to sustain growth and well-functioning markets.

Box 1: APEC Finance Ministers Recommendations on Social
Safety Nets for a Globalizing Asia and Pacific Region
The main recommendations include: (1) social safety nets should be in
place before a crisis occurs since they can address the needs of the poor
in good economic times, and should be adaptable to combat the effects
of crisis; (2) pre-crisis planning is essential to effectively address the social
effects of crises and includes the availability of reliable and timely information on the poor and frequent evaluation of safety net programs; and
(3) countries can select from a wide range of available instruments
depending on their administrative capacity and target populations. In
selecting the appropriate instruments, governments should ensure that
the measures: (i) provide adequate protection to the poor; (ii) promote
efficient targeting; (iii) avoid creating a culture of dependency among
recipients by limiting size and duration of benefits; (iv) are consistent with
economic incentives and overall targets of fiscal and macroeconomic policy;
and (v) encourage transparency and accountability in the design and implementation of programs and in the use of resources. From Social Safety

C. The components of social protection
13. The policies and projects included in social protection can be thought
of as involving five major kinds of activities, summarized below. Box 2 shows
the target clientele for social protection.
(i)

labor market policies and programs designed to facilitate employment and promote the efficient operation of labor markets;

(ii)

social insurance programs to cushion the risks associated with
unemployment, health, disability, work injury, and old age;

(iii) social assistance and welfare service programs for the most vulnerable groups with no other means of adequate support;
(iv) micro and area-based schemes to address vulnerability at the community level; and
(v)

child protection to ensure the healthy and productive development
of the future Asian workforce.

1.

Labor markets

14. The focus on labor adjustments and the efficient operation of labor
markets recognizes that, as economic development proceeds, employment
will become the major source of economic support for most workers and
their families. Improving labor market operations is an important element
of strategies to reduce poverty, facilitate human capital development, and
address gender discrimination. It will also help allocate a country’s human
capital resources to their most productive uses, enhancing general economic welfare and encouraging growth and development.
15. Labor market improvements to enhance social protection include the
following.
(i)

Labor market assessments describing demographic trends, laborabsorbing sectors, unemployment, migration flows, and the size and
causes of the informal sector can help identify a country’s needs and
development options.

(ii)

Active labor markets programs include (a) direct employment generation (promoting small and medium enterprises, public works);
(b) labor exchanges or employment services (job brokerage, counseling) linking supply with demand for labor; and (c) skills development programs (training and retraining of labor).

(iii) Passive labor market policies include (a) unemployment insurance,
(b) income support, and (c) an appropriate legislative framework that
strikes a balance between economic efficiency and labor protection.
An appropriate legislative framework will include provisions on issues
such as minimum age, maximum hours and overtime, labor contracts,
industrial relations, special protection appropriate for new mothers,
and anti-discrimination provisions to protect women and minorities.
Internationally recognized labor standards, when ratified, are also part
of the legislative framework of a DMC. With regard to the Core Labor
Standards, no explicit ratification is needed for them to be part of the
legislative framework of a country. The Core Labor Standards consist
of (a) freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right
to collective bargaining, (b) the abolition of all forms of forced or compulsory labor, (c) the elimination of discrimination in respect of
employment and occupation, and (d) the elimination of child labor.

15

All Asian and Pacific DMCs,6 by virtue of being member of the International Labour Organization (ILO), are held to respect, promote, and
realize the fundamental Core Labor Standards.
(iv) Safeguards: appropriate steps should be taken to ensure that procurement of goods and services, contractors, subcontractors, and consultants, comply with the country’s labor legislation (e.g., minimum
wages, safe working conditions, social security contributions, etc.) as
well as with the Core Labor Standards.

Box 3: Mass Lay-offs and Retrenchment Plans
The three major causes of mass layoffs are (i) market shifts (cyclical or
structural); (ii) privatization and/or deregulation; and (iii) technological and/
or organizational change, including enterprise restructuring. Unemployment
and mass layoffs are problematic in any society, but present special challenges in developing countries because the number of affected workers is
normally larger than in developed societies, the political context is often
not favorable to collective bargaining, and the labor market is likely to be
saturated and the demand for labor is low. The three major policy options
to avoid or mitigate the negative impacts of lay-offs are (i) prevention of
lay-offs, (ii) compensation to laid-off workers, and (iii) redeployment of laidoff workers. There is no best solution and each situation will require a
tailored plan. Optimally, employers can benefit from raising productivity
and lower wage costs to enhance enterprise competitiveness, and workers can benefit from alternative employment options. The available policies are based on (i) legal regulations, (ii) income support, (iii) retraining,
and (iv) improved labor market information and counseling. Aspects such
as the age and skills of the labor force, financial solvency of companies,
fiscal impacts, the local labor market situation, income levels of employees, the existence of adequate social protection institutions (e.g., unemployment insurance, vocational and technical training centers, and labor
exchanges) are critical elements when assessing a retrenchment plan.
Mitigation options should always aim to adequately balance social fairness and economic sustainability.

2.

Social insurance

16. Participating in labor markets exposes workers to several kinds of risks.
Reducing these risks allows workers who have lost their jobs to search for
a good alternative, removes barriers that might otherwise discourage workers from acquiring education and training, and helps ensure that the health
6

of Micronesia, Nauru, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

and education of their children are not sacrificed in an economic downturn. Social insurance programs mitigate the risks by providing income support in the event of illness, disability, work injury, maternity, unemployment,
and old age. Such programs include
(i)

unemployment insurance to deal with frictional (sometimes structural) unemployment;

(ii)

work injury insurance to compensate workers for work-related injuries or diseases;7

(iii) disability and invalidity insurance, normally linked to old-age pensions, to cover for full or partial disability;
(iv) sickness and health insurance to protect workers from diseases;7
(v)

maternity insurance to provide benefits to mothers during pregnancy
and post delivery lactating months;

(vi) old-age insurance to provide income support after retirement; and
(vii) life and survivors insurance, normally linked to old-age pension to
ensure that dependents are compensated for the loss of the breadwinner.
17. As countries develop, some form of government intervention is needed
to deal effectively with these risks. Family resources, even those of an
extended family, are no longer sufficient to deal with the individual risks. A
wide variety of approaches are available for structuring and operating social
insurance programs. They may be contributory, in that eligibility is based
on the payment of premiums each year, or noncontributory; and handled
either by public sector or private sector institutions. Where such programs
are managed by the private sector, however, government retains a major
role in overseeing and regulating their operation. Traditionally, private
insurance companies have had difficulty providing products affordable to
low-income groups because of problems associated with high transaction
costs, adverse selection, and moral hazard.
18. Most countries have evolved toward a multipillar mixed public-private
system that contains two basic elements: (i) public programs to assure minimum income to the aged, unemployed, and other vulnerable groups; and
7

These programs should be accompanied by adequate programs to promote safety at work
and minimize occupational health hazards.

17

(ii) private programs that encourage voluntary supplementation by individuals. In the case of old-age pensions, a second intermediate pillar is added:
public or private programs that provide retirement benefits scaled to individual
contributions. The design of a particular social insurance intervention involves
selecting the approach that seems most appropriate, considering the country’s
stage of development and its social traditions. A proper balance must be maintained between the social gains from improved protection and the economic
losses that can occur if a system becomes too generous.

3.

Social assistance

19. Social assistance and welfare services provide protection to those who
cannot qualify for insurance payments or would otherwise receive inadequate benefits. Social assistance programs are designed primarily to
enhance social welfare by reducing poverty directly. Programs targeted to
younger people can also promote longer term growth and development by
encouraging greater investment in human capital.
20.

Social assistance interventions may include

(i)

welfare and social services, institutionalized or community-based,
to highly vulnerable sections of the population, such as the physically
or mentally disabled, orphans, and substance abusers;

(ii)

cash or in-kind transfers such as food stamps and family allowances
to vulnerable groups;

(iii) temporary subsidies, such as energy life-line tariffs, housing subsidies, or support of lower prices of staple food in times of crisis; and
(iv) safeguards: attention should be paid to possible short-term negative
impacts of policy reforms: in cases of a rise in prices and/or loss of
entitlements to the poor, adequate mitigation measures are needed
to prevent any adverse effect on the poor and the vulnerable; in the
case of infrastructure, it should be designed to allow disabled populations to benefit from public investments.

4.

Protecting the informal sector:
micro and area-based schemes

21. Micro and area-based schemes provide the same sort of social protection to small-scale agriculture and the urban informal sector that the
more traditional social insurance programs supply to the labor force.
Microinsurance offers the option to insure the poor against their main risks
18

at affordable prices. Crop insurance programs can provide the protection
necessary to encourage the adoption of new and innovative farming techniques, thereby removing an important barrier to economic development
in rural areas. Together with well-designed risk reduction initiatives such
as disaster management, and community-based support programs such as
social funds, these programs can reduce vulnerability at the community
level and promote more sustainable rural livelihoods.
22. Microinsurance. Microinsurance involves voluntary and contributory
schemes for the community, handling small-scale cash flows to address
major community risks. Often such schemes are of a local character and
have a very small membership. The primary aim of many of these schemes
(Box 4) is to help their members meet the unpredictable burden of out-ofpocket expenses, such as a hospital emergency, death, or funeral expenses.
In recent years, groups of workers in the informal economy have set up
their own microinsurance schemes, normally assisted by grants or government subsidies. Such schemes may operate within the context of a
microfinance scheme, which has already had experience collecting
contributions and administering payments. Microinsurance is an emerging
Box 4: Targeting Benefits in Social Assistance
Although some countries have universal benefits, most social assistance programs are targeted. Four main targeting methods are available:
(i) Group targeting provides benefits to a specific population group (e.g.,
mothers, children, and communities in a particular geographical area);
this is the easiest targeting method, but leakages to the nonpoor are
normally large.
(ii) Means testing: means-tested targeted programs provide benefits to
households below a certain income level; means testing is more
accurate in targeting poverty but has larger transaction costs than
group targeting.
(iii) Proxy-means testing is a subset of means-testing, in which targeting
is done through other (easy-to-collect) indicators or proxies to correlate the level of income/poverty of beneficiaries; on a temporary basis, it is possible simply to give discretion to local public officials or to
a local NGO.
(iv) Self-selection avoids moral hazards by imposing disincentives to participants into programs, either because the benefits are too low or
because there is some social stigma associated with them (e.g., foodfor-work programs and public works because normally only those truly
in need accept them). However, given that benefits are normally below
market wages, these programs are not effective in bringing people
out of poverty.

Box 5: The SEWA Microinsurance Scheme, India
The Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) is a registered trade
union working mainly with women in the informal sector. Since 1972, its
struggle has been to ensure that the minimum wage is obtained, to provide legal recourse where necessary, and to ensure democratic representation at every level of the organization. The trade union has almost 250,000
members. They are mostly hawkers and vendors, home-based workers,
and laborers. The scheme covers health insurance (including a small
maternity benefit component), life insurance (death and disability), and
asset insurance (loss of damage to housing unit or work equipment). SEWA
members can choose to become members of the insurance scheme (at
present, approximately 14% of all SEWA members are insured). The asset
and health components come as a package and life insurance is an option.
The total premium is approximately $1.5 (Rs60) per annum for the combined asset and health insurance package and an additional $0.38 (Rs15)
provides life insurance as well. Premiums and benefits are presently being
restructured. Membership and claims processing is done through the SEWA
Bank, along with considerable field presence and grassroots organizing
from SEWA Bank and SEWA Union staff. Mobile services are also available for premium collection (normally associated with microfinance deposits
and loan repayment collections).

topic with high potential. Microinsurance can provide social insurance at
affordable prices, expanding coverage by having a realistic understanding
of the problems that communities face, and promoting community involvement. There are good historical examples of microinsurance, for instance,
mutual societies played an important developmental role in early 20th century in Europe. Options for the future include pooling existing organizations,
promoting reinsurance, and providing private-public partnerships. More
effort needs to be placed in marketing microinsurance, as a large percentage of the target population is not well informed of the benefits of being
insured, and the credibility of microinsurance needs strengthening.
23. Agricultural Insurance. This form of protection could be available
for farming communities. It is a financial mechanism in which the uncertainty of loss in the farms is minimized by pooling a large number of uncertainties that impact on agriculture so that the burden of loss can be
distributed. The loss may be due to a number of natural perils like storms,
floods, droughts, hail, frost, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, plant pests,
diseases, etc. The risks of loss can be spread temporally or spatially. With
reinsurance, the risks can be further spread across national boundaries.
For instance, during natural disasters of widespread proportion when a
nation’s finances are at a low ebb, other countries share the burden.
20

Agricultural insurance can be reexamined as an effective tool for the development of the rural economy when implemented as part of a package of
support services in the rural areas, cautiously accompanied by adequate
reinsurance mechanisms.
24. Social Funds. Such funds have evolved recently outside the Asia and
Pacific region as mechanisms to channel public resources to meet particularly pressing social needs. Community-based social funds are agencies,
typically managed at the local level, empowering communities, NGOs, and
local governments that provide finance for small-scale projects, such as
infrastructure schemes and livelihood programs to community groups. They
provide direct poverty relief and encourage skills development while
contributing to a community’s social capital. The 1977 financial crisis and
the growth in the number of countries undergoing economic transition have
led to an increase in social funds projects in Asia (Box 6). Social fund
Box 6: Post-conflict Poverty Reduction and Communitybuilding: The SZOPAD Social Fund, Philippines
The Special Zone of Peace and Development (SZOPAD) Social Fund, for
$15.33 million, was approved in 1998 following the September 1996 agreement between the Government and the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF) to end the long-running conflict in Mindanao. The objectives of the
fund are to (i) increase the access of the poor and those affected by the
conflict in Mindanao to economic and social infrastructure, services, and
employment opportunities; and (ii) strengthen the capacity of local governments and communities to manage development. The fund covers the
14 provinces and 9 cities in the special zone and gives priority to helping
the poor, MNLF combatants, indigenous peoples, and communities
affected by the armed conflict. The fund provides grant finance to local
governments, organizations, and community groups for small-scale social
and economic infrastructure including rural access roads, rural water supply and sanitation, small-scale irrigation schemes, communal clinics, and
schools. The maximum eligible scheme size is $250,000. Financing is also
available for education and health supplies and equipment, and essential
medicines. The fund duration is three years, with the possibility of an
extension, expansion or replication. The fund was established by Executive
Order of the Philippine President in October 1997 as an independent legal
entity, principally to avoid political interference. The fund has a policy-making
board of directors and an executive committee, appointed by the President, responsible for approving schemes proposed by local organizations.
The salaries of fund staff were set above prevailing government rates to
attract competent and motivated individuals and reduce the risk of corruption. Streamlined procurement and disbursement rules and regulations
have been agreed to speed up implementation.

21

methodology is now used by local governments to promote good local governance and pilot test decentralized management and financing of smallscale infrastructure in some Asian countries.
25. Disaster Preparedness and Management. This is essential to assist
communities in risk coping and mitigation. As shown in Figure 6, the Asia
and Pacific region is where most people are injured, affected, and homeless as a result of disasters. Victims of catastrophes are usually assisted by
public relief programs;8 however, given the important economic and human loss caused by disasters, the critical issue is to invest in disaster preparedness. Several countries in the Asia and Pacific region have established
disaster management centers for assessing hazards, planning risk reduction and monitoring programs, providing emergency assistance, and
strengthening local-level risk reduction capacity. Two principal trends have
developed over the past decade in disaster management: (i) improved hazard forecasting through computer models on climatic behavior; and (ii) an
increased focus on local vulnerabilities given that community-based
preparedness is the best mechanism to reduce loss of human life and the
scale of damage.

Child protection

26. Given that children and youth constitute 40% of DMC populations,
investing in child protection is of profound significance to the development
of the region. The realities of child deprivation are alarming in Asia and the
Pacific, which holds three quarters of the world’s stunted, underweight
children. Lack of adequate protection can result in undernourishment, poor
health, and intellectual underdevelopment which can lead to being less
productive adults. Educating children and youth is essential to allow social
mobility and better job prospects, and an indispensable instrument to help
DMCs maintain their international competitive advantage, raise productivity,
and continue economic growth. Additionally, as defined in the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, society through good governance must provide measures to ensure that the child is protected from all
forms of abuse and exploitation, such as child labor, child prostitution, or
the adversities faced by the girl child, streetchildren, children with disabilities, and children under armed conflict. Investment in children is a key factor in poverty reduction and economic growth but it is usually a small
proportion of national budgets, despite ample evidence that the small
investments currently made bring considerable future benefits to society
as a whole.
27. High child/adult dependency ratios indicate the need to provide social
protection for the young, such as
(i)

early child development to ensure the balanced psychomotive
development of the child through basic nutrition, preventive health,
and educational programs;

(ii)

school feeding programs, scholarships, or school fee waivers;

(iii) waiving of fees for mothers and children in health services;
(iv) streetchildren initiatives;
(v)

child rights advocacy/awareness programs against child abuse, child
labor etc;

(vi) youth programs to avoid social anomia in teenagers, criminality, sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS, early pregnancies, and drug
addiction; and
(vii) family allowances, either means-tested cash transfers or coupons/
stamps for basic goods and services (i.e., food, clothing) to assist families with young children to meet part of their basic needs.
23

D. Social protection systems in the
Asia and Pacific region
28. The experience of the Asia and Pacific region has been diverse in the
past, and the motivations and approaches for future reform differ from one
country to another. Generally in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific
most of the debate has focused on expanding coverage and identifying
financing sources to fight poverty and provide long-term protection to the
population. In transition economies, the focus has centered on adjusting
existing systems to a market economy.
29. As shown in Table 2 in the following pages, most DMCs have some
form of institutionalized social protection system, but often these programs
are ineffective due to (i) limited coverage, serving only a portion of the formal sector (often the wealthiest segments of society); (ii) insufficient funds,
incorrectly distributed among programs; (iii) inadequate instruments, often
copied from developed countries but not appropriate to serve specific
in-country needs; and (iv) factors restricting access to statutory social protection schemes, such as legal restrictions, administrative bottlenecks, and
problems with compliance.
30. In considering the demands for social protection within Asian subregions it is important to identify the circumstances faced by their vulnerable
groups. Table 3 summarizes the social protection priority issues by subregion. The countries of East and Southeast Asia are still recovering from the
regional financial crisis and high levels of unemployment, and need substantial investments in social protection to overcome poverty and reduce
social risk and vulnerability. The transition economies, Central Asian
republics, People’s Republic of China, Viet Nam, and (to a lesser extent)
Cambodia and Lao People’s Democratic Republic, are restructuring and
consolidating their systems to a market-oriented society; existing statefunded and state-controlled social protection schemes are being dismantled,
reformed to adjust to reduced budgets, and made more flexible to labor
market changes. South Asian countries (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and
in a lesser degree Sri Lanka) have large proportions of the rural population
living in poverty with high levels of illiteracy, and state-funded social protection schemes exist only nominally and are supplemented by some limited programs operated by NGOs. The region needs substantial investments
in social protection and human development targeted to children and the
informal sector and truly vulnerable groups. The Pacific region presents a

24

variety of experiences, with some countries having developed social protection systems and others still to do so. A common trait to all countries in
the region is the need to address child and youth priorities, extend coverage to poorer communities, improve governance, and promote institutional
development. In general, all subregions have reduced expenditure on social
protection schemes in the last decade in an attempt to balance budgets
and achieve macroeconomic stabilization. Since the Asian crisis, the effect
has been to increase poverty, insecurity, and social exclusion for many vulnerable groups.

E. The experience of ADB and other aid agencies
31. In response to the critical need to address vulnerability in development, following the experience of poverty reduction programs in the regions
where they operate, multilateral and bilateral aid agencies produced
different definitions of social protection. The World Bank definition of social
protection is based on social risk management; the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) emphasizes social protection as a means to address
macroeconomic and catastrophic shocks; the United Kingdom Department
for International Development (DFID) uses a rights-based approach to define
social protection, with an emphasis on promoting integrated livelihoods.
ILO, which is the senior agency dealing with social protection topics,
maintains a structured view of social security based mostly on social insurance and labor standards.
32. ILO was founded in 1919 to promote social justice and ensure effective social protection systems among its member countries, provide social
and economic security, implement fundamental labor rights, increase work
opportunities, and strengthen social dialogue. The definition of social
security and the focus of ILO’s work have changed often during the last
eight decades. ILO has recently adopted as its strategic objective to enhance coverage and effectiveness of social protection for all, by focusing
on income security with an emphasis on the poor, identifying cost-effective
and equitable ways by which social protection can be extended to all groups,
and shifting from a state-led focus to emphasis on provision of social protection to the informal sector.9 However, social protection is still conceived
mainly in terms of labor and social insurance. ILO provides technical assistance primarily in the fields of social security systems, social protection

Vulnerability Issues
Since the transition in the early
1990s populations have
experienced a steep decline in
living standards, greater vulnerability.
Unemployment rose due to
SOE reform and insufficient
economic activity. Coverage of
social services is good but
benefits are inadequate due
to lack of funds. Human development
remains high due to earlier
achievements-high levels of
education and women development.
However, the next generation will
show much lower standards
unless immediate action is taken.
Generally, growth has led to important
reductions in poverty, however growth
alone does not ensure sustainable
poverty reduction. New vulnerable groups
emerge—unemployed because of
economic shift/downturns, migrants,
the new urban poor, youth, etc. Limited
investments in SP have resulted in
precarious conditions for the population—
children and rural areas still need of
support. Major vulnerabilities by subarea
include:
Informal safety nets, once the major
support of populations in Southeast Asia,
are disappearing due to modernization
and migration patterns. 40% are children
and youth. Child labor is prevalent and the
informal sector remains large.
Investments in all SP areas are much
needed; programs exist nominally but
are underbudgeted and coverage is low.
Short-term social safety nets were
prominent during the crisis and generated
a public debate on SP.
In the PRC, SOE reform is a pressing
issue that will require significant
investments in labor markets and
social protection; most welfare
provision comes through SOEs and
public service. In the Mekong and
inner rural PRC, poverty is prevalent.
Labor laws are generally rigid and
needs to be made flexible.
Generally the Pacific has done little
to develop comprehensive SP systems.
As much as 50% of the population is
below 19—a challenge is to deal with
youth unemployment.
The area suffers from very high levels
of poverty and populations are highly
vulnerable to all types of risks, from
lifecycle to natural disasters. Poverty
reduction should be the first priority;
about 70% of the population live in
rural areas, 45% of the population are
children and youth below 19. Child labor
is prevalent; life expectancy and woman
development is low. The formal sector is
very limited; formal SP systems reach a
small portion of the population.

ADB Social Protection Priorities
• Given the large increase on poverty, SP
should target interventions to priority areas (i.e.,
children, rural communities) and generally
adjust earlier SP systems to reduced budgets
and decentralized management.
• Labor markets: low demand for labor will
persist unless economic activity is created—
microenterprise development and other
employment generation programs are feasible
due to high education levels; on the other
hand, labor markets need to be more flexible.
• Due to poverty incidence, social insurance
reforms based on linking contribution to
benefits are not priority at this stage.
Different investments in SP are needed in the
variety of countries of the large East Asia region.
Common to all:
• labor market interventions to increase
productivity in this growth-oriented area while
raising working standards;
deal with redundant workers in SOEs,
• child protection,
• micro and area approaches to protect
communities, and
• developing comprehensive and effective SP
systems.
Specific priorities by subarea are:
• Southeast Asia has developed labor training
and initiated some labor services—given
demographic trends, they should be continued.
• Child protection and micro and areabased approaches are also critical
investments to deal with a large informal sector,
particularly in countries where poverty is
a major priority such as Philippines.
• Safety nets developed during the crisis
should be converted into longer term
formal comprehensive SP systems.
• Projects targeted at women and girls remain
priority.
• The transition economies need labor markets
interventions.
• Comprehensive and effective social
protection systems should be built in parallel
with SOE reforms and rural development to
ensure enhanced welfare provision.
• In the Mekong transition economies and inner
rural PRC, where poverty is prevalent, micro
and area-based approaches and child
protection are needed.
• Labor market policies to reduce labor rigidities
while ensuring fair working conditions,
employment generating activities, and
child protection are general priorities in the
region.
• Child protection interventions.
• Projects targeted at women and girls.
• Micro and area-based approaches to protect
communities (urban and rural); financial
intermediation (microfinance) has been
generally successful in the area and should be
expanded to areas such as microinsurance.
• Labor markets: public works have been
popular and labor market interventions should
be expanded.
• Formal SP policies such as insurance
programs (e.g., pensions) are not priority at this
stage.

administration and expansion of coverage, social expenditure management,
labor relations, vocational training, employment policy, labor administration, labor law and industrial working conditions, management development, cooperatives, labor statistics, and occupational safety and health. From
this perspective, ILO should be a partner in any social protection initiative.
33. The World Bank focus uses social risk management as the conceptual framework for its Social Protection Strategy Paper, consistent with its
Comprehensive Development Framework and Poverty Reduction Strategy
Papers (PRSPs). Social protection is defined as public interventions oriented
to human capital to (i) help individuals, households, and communities better manage risk; and (ii) provide support to the incapacitated poor.10 The
concept of social risk management asserts that all individuals, households,
and communities are vulnerable to multiple risks from different sources,
whether they are natural (such as earthquakes, floods, and illness) or manmade (such as unemployment, environmental degradation, and war). Poor
people are typically more exposed to risk and have inferior access to effective risk management instruments than people with greater assets. Dealing
with risks involves recognizing their sources and economic characteristics,
for example, whether they affect individuals in an unrelated manner or
simultaneously. The most appropriate combination of risk management
strategies (prevention, mitigation, or coping) and arrangements (informal,
market-based, or publicly provided or mandated) in any given situation
depends on the type of risk and on the direct and opportunity costs and
effectiveness of the available instruments. On the organizational side, the
World Bank has established its Social Protection Department under its
Human Development Network, with units in most of the World Bank’s
human development regional divisions. The World Bank Board of Directors
endorsed its comprehensive Social Protection Strategy on 7 September 2000.
34. IADB defines social protection as prevention and compensation systems to reduce the impacts of shocks on the Latin American poor.11 The
definition owes much to the needs and economic history of the region,
after the macroeconomic and structural crisis of the 1980s and 1990s (debt

crisis and structural adjustment shocks) and frequent natural disasters (hurricanes such as Mitch in 1998, earthquakes like the ones in Mexico in 1985
and Colombia in 1994, and floods and droughts resulting from El Niño). The
key objectives of the IADB social protection strategy are to (i) guarantee
minimum consumption levels and access to basic services for those permanently unable to provide for themselves (i.e., the aged and disabled);
(ii) strengthen the asset base of the poor to reduce their vulnerability to
shocks; (iii) ensure continued investment in human capital during periods
of crisis in order to avoid irreversible long-term consequences for children;
and (iv) provide security to the poor to improve their economic choices
and allow them to take entrepreneurial risks and earning capacity.
35. To achieve the International Development Goal of halving poverty by
2015, DFID emphasizes requirements of economic growth, equity, and
security.12 DFID supports a rights-based approach to poverty reduction.
Decent living standards, access to services and security are part of the fabric of rights of poor people. These rights are enshrined in national laws,
international agreements and covenants, including Core Labor Standards,
and form the basis on which development organizations formulate their
policies. Participation in the formulation of such policies by poor people is
an equally important part of a rights-based approach. And the issue of security, in a broad sense, is central among poor people’s priorities. DFID has
worked extensively on the notion of sustaining livelihoods to promote opportunities for all citizens and reduce poverty. In this context, social protection refers to the public actions taken in response to levels of vulnerability,
risk, and deprivation for those who fall temporarily or persistently under
levels of livelihood deemed acceptable within a given polity or society.13
36. ADB has developed different types of social protection interventions
over the years, either as stand-alone loans or as components of other loans
where social protection is not the primary objective. Since 1985, where social
protection projects were only about 1% of the total ADB lending, the portfolio has been expanding. In 1998–2000, it represented 13% of the total ADB

lending volume. This significant increase is due to the support to safety nets
interventions after the Asian crisis. The demand for rapid social support
projects will hopefully not be necessary in the future—instead, ADB should
concentrate on developing more comprehensive and effective social protection systems to assist DMCs to reduce poverty and vulnerability. The trend,
however, reflects an important increase in lending in the sector. Social protection is an emerging sector that needs to be properly addressed. An analysis of the areas served shows that ADB has mostly invested in labor markets
(39.5% of the social protection portfolio, by volume), followed by micro and
area-based schemes to protect communities (27.5%), and child protection
interventions (19.5%). Social insurance and social assistance had a lesser
share of the portfolio (6.5% and 7% respectively, by volume).
37. As social protection took on a new urgency at ADB, the need for more
effective coordination strategies became clear. In October 1998, an interdepartmental working group was formed to explore options for ADB’s future
interventions in social protection.14 A framework for operations on social
protection was developed in July 1999, after close consultations among
departments, and was distributed and discussed with selected DMC governments, NGOs, and other aid agencies. The following drafts ended in a
formal submission to the 57 ADB member countries in April 2001, and a
consensus was reached on 13 September 2001, when the ADB Social Protection Strategy was approved.

studies on labor markets, social insurance, social assistance, micro and area-based
schemes, and child protection, which are the basis of this strategic framework.

III. Priorities for social
protection
38. Improving national social protection systems is of major importance
in all regions. However, the motivations for reform and the approaches
adopted differ dramatically from one country to the other. In much of the
Asia and Pacific region, the debate is dominated by concerns about reducing poverty, expanding coverage, and identifying financing mechanisms to
serve the vast majority of the population, 40% of which are children and
youth, who remain unprotected. In transition economies, adjusting programs and institutions to reduced budgets under a market economy is the
priority. Many Latin American reforms are motivated by a desire to insulate
social protection systems from political interferences. The reform debate
in Japan, North America, and Western Europe tends to focus disproportionately on dealing with the costs of aging societies. Country priorities differ
substantially and the problems and solutions of one region are not applicable to another.
39. Given the broad variety of reform priorities and possible interventions
(labor markets, social insurance, social assistance, area-based schemes,
and child protection), the strategy sets the parameters to prioritize investments, based on the principles of reducing poverty and vulnerability;
strengthening country focus; enhancing strategic alliances and partnerships
with development agencies, private sector, and civil society; and taking a
long-/medium-term approach to promote effective social protection systems in Asia and the Pacific. Well-developed social protection systems are
large and complex undertakings that can become an integral part of the
fabric of a society and have important implications for social and economic
development. Social protection priorities are different in the variety of Asian
and Pacific DMCs. The selection of interventions will require an evaluation
of the country needs, available resources, institutional capacity, and the
political economy of reform. Once a set of specific social protection interventions has been chosen for a DMC, project design should attend to the
following principles: coverage; targeting of vulnerable population groups;
sustainability, good governance, and optimal delivery mechanisms; and an
integrated approach to social protection.
33

A. Identifying country priorities
40. Social protection strategies will vary from one country to another as a
result of differences in needs, institutions, and available resources. Country
preferences will also be influenced by the political support and social consensus needed to implement reforms. An analysis of these four factors
determines the social protection priorities of a country.

1.

Country needs

41. The main objective of social protection is to reduce poverty and vulnerability. A summary vulnerability and risk profile will help to determine the country-specific social protection needs. A description of major
risks to the population, demographic structures, levels of urban-rural population, poverty, and the size of the formal sector influence the type of social
protection mechanisms that are feasible and appropriate. Where population projections15 show a significant number of children and new entrants
into the labor market in the near future, social protection should address
the needs of the young. Where population growth rates are low or negative,
there is a rapidly aging population and the child/adult dependency ratios
are low, social protection systems should address the priorities of the elderly. Where the most acute problems may be others—i.e., migrant workers,
victims of disasters, or any other vulnerable population group—social protection planning should accommodate the specific country needs. The
results will differ from one DMC to another.
42. A summary labor market analysis should further help determine
country priorities, not only in social protection but also in the selection of
other development interventions, by revealing employment patterns. The
size of the formal and informal sectors; the sectoral distribution (population engaged in agriculture, industry, and services); rural and urban active
population; evolution of real wages; the role of women in the labor force;
working conditions; compliance with national and international labor laws
and standards including the reported existence of child or bonded labor
and violations to other Core Labor Standards—all will provide additional
information to help determine the country priorities. In some countries,

15

34

Care has to be taken with the assumptions used in projections. Arguments can be easily
manipulated by developing models that either magnify or minimize issues (e.g., aging). As
a rule, ADB discourages high or low scenarios and advises to carefully evaluate mediumterm variant projections.

the priority attention will be to assist unemployed or underemployed working age population to find employment opportunities; or to fight child labor.
In others, the rural areas may have been forced to shoulder a disproportionate burden of the country’s social problems, and strengthening rural
systems may be a priority. Labor absorption is essential to avoid poverty.
The country labor market analysis should evaluate which sectors/subsectors
and geographical areas have a demand for labor and identify which areas
may have an unmet supply of labor, to identify the right mix of public policies. Labor market analysis is a key element in the strategic link between
economic growth and poverty reduction, and the analysis should provide
recommendations to ensure efficient and inclusive development patterns.
43. A summary vulnerability profile, supported by a summary labor market analysis, are essential to determine country-specific needs. The country social protection needs assessment with a rational prioritization of the
country’s top social protection needs, based on quantitative evidence gathered in the vulnerability profile and labor market analysis, to ensure a rational and well-demonstrated prioritization of possible development
interventions. Collaboration with other agencies—including ILO, World
Bank, UNICEF, World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), and the Red Cross/Red Crescent—is
essential to ensure coherent views and avoid repetition of surveys, profiles,
or analyses.

2.

Available resources

44. The level of resources available for social protection will also influence a country’s social protection choices. Many existing social protection
systems and programs are underbudgeted, receive random funding, or have
mistargeted benefits. Where allocated public funds are limited and the country needs large, public programs should be targeted to those most in need.
An evaluation of the effectivity of current programs and resources to reduce
poverty and vulnerability in the country will immediately point the need for
reforms (see paras. 57-59). If a country lacks the fiscal resources to achieve
the development of a comprehensive social security system with significant coverage, it should opt to concentrate on poverty reduction and improvements in the labor force through the combination of labor market
policies and programs, child protection, micro and area-based schemes,
social assistance, and minimal social insurance benefits.

35

45. Social expenditures reviews are a key instrument to determine fund
allocations intra and intersectorally, showing the administrative costs of
social protection, the relative weight as compared to other social
expenditures, the distribution of funds among social protection programs;
the benefit incidence and effectivity in reaching vulnerable and poor populations; and last, but not least, distribution issues—who is paying and who
benefits. The matching of the social expenditure review with the country
needs assessment will provide the key to the needed social protection
reforms. Social expenditure reviews, in line with the public expenditure
reviews developed by governments and aid agencies, particularly ILO and
World Bank, will thus be critical in assessing the effectivity of current allocations to reduce poverty and vulnerability and discussing the options for
social protection reform.

3.

Existing institutions

46. Where social protection programs already exist, conscious decisions
will have to be made about whether reform efforts should build on the
existing institutions or whether new institutions should be created. Societies almost always have at least some form of formal social protection institutions, but the institutions that exist may be very weak or cover only an
extremely small fraction of the population. Where the existing institutions
are neither very large nor very important, they may not impose serious constraints on the reform process. Where they are large, however, their influence cannot be ignored. Existing institutions influence policies about the
structure and philosophy of social protection in several ways. They form a
point of reference for comparing alternatives. Where the current approaches
are generally viewed favorably among the population, the political path of
least resistance will be to build on and extend them. The country’s institutional history, including the relative credibility of the public and private sectors and the extent of previous government social protection commitments,
inevitably affects the scope and character of any new intervention. Given
that existing institutions have staff and stakeholders who are likely to protect themselves, large government bureaucracies are not dismantled easily and private concerns that are profiting from the existing arrangements
will resist change. A good stakeholder analysis of old and new providers
and recipients of social protection may facilitate discussions during country programming and project design, by making the trade-offs transparent.
Reforming social protection policies is likely to be easier—and the odds of
success are correspondingly higher—if the new approach preserves an
important role for the existing institutions.

36

47. The decision whether to invest in social protection will require an
understanding of the country-specific institutional capacity to deliver
reforms, including (i) the efficiency and coverage of existing social protection programs, and (ii) the possible roles and risks involved in using public,
market-based, and civil society/NGO mechanisms for new social protection programs. Before embarking on reforms, the institutional prerequisites
of different social protection approaches need to be taken into account.
The risks involved in engaging the public and private sectors need to be
assessed to ensure that the proposed reforms will effectively reduce poverty and vulnerability, the main objective of a social protection system. For
instance, market-based companies often find disincentives to serving the
poor; unless a proper public-private arrangement is envisaged, the poor
will likely remain uncovered. Pension reform projects often involve development of privately funded mechanisms to encourage the development of
sophisticated financial market institutions, but they can function effectively
only if the domestic capital market has already reached a minimum level of
development; where the preconditions for advance funding are absent,
provident funds or basic pay-as-you-go approaches may be important transition measures to ensure that the objectives of a social protection system
are accomplished. Targeted poverty and social assistance interventions that
rely on formal means-testing operate on the assumption that institutions
have the sufficient capacity to collect, process, and store information;
investments should ensure that either this capacity is built or other institutional arrangements are found. Paragraphs 60-67 provide more details on
different institutional options.

4.

The political economy of reform

48. The potential gains must be balanced against the likely losses from
reforming a social protection system. This will involve a careful review of
the conditions under which benefits are provided and the ways in which
subsidies are constructed or abolished, the relationship between the value
of the assistance offered and prevailing wages or prices, the affordability of
the services provided, the incentives established in the program for delaying taking benefits and/or returning to work as quickly as possible, and the
balance between the costs and benefits of new regulations. Reforms that
may encounter large resistance need more intense consultations with relevant stakeholders.
49. Successful programs are those supported by the serious political commitment of the country’s leadership. Social protection systems normally

37

reflect the country’s social architecture. To be effective, social protection
strategies should be articulated in an integrated manner and discussed with
all relevant social players as reforms are an opportunity to rethink the
country’s social contract. This, however, is often not the case, and reforms
are precipitated by crises that have exposed or exacerbated flaws in existing policies. The experience of the transition economies and countries
affected by the Asian crisis has shown that governments should not be asked
to pursue policies that will require a consensus that has not yet formed
within the society. A social protection agenda should be framed taking into
account DMCs national policies and priorities as well as ADB’s overarching
goal of reducing poverty, ensuring that social protection is integrated with
other development activities and into ongoing country dialogue.

B. Strategic principles for social protection interventions
50. Once one or a combination of social protection policies within the
five different components (labor markets, social insurance, social assistance,
micro and area-based approaches, and/or child protection) have been
selected in a particular DMC, the design of the specific program selected
should attempt to balance several trade-offs to effectively reduce poverty
and vulnerability and promote human development. The assessment should
focus on the following considerations: (i) the program’s coverage and benefits, (ii) its effectivity in targeting vulnerable groups and specific gender
issues, (iii) the sustainability of the program (except perhaps for certain
temporary interventions motivated by an economic crisis) and the adequacy
of its institutional arrangements, and (iv) the program’s integrated approach.
Investments in program design may not be worthwhile where the program
does not contribute to reduce poverty and vulnerability, sustainability is open
to question, coverage is likely to be limited, and population groups in need
are not served.

1.

Coverage

51. Expanding access to social protection programs should be the main
objective of the formal social protection agenda of Asian and Pacific DMCs.
In most DMCs, both public and private sectors have failed to provide effective social protection to the population. The rate of expansion will vary across
countries in the region and depend on the financial and institutional
resources available. Coverage gaps occur due to statutory exclusions, poor
enforcement, or the lack of attractive benefits despite high contributions
for particular groups.

38

52. Statutory Exclusions. Labor market regulations and standards and
contributory social insurance programs designed for universal coverage in
the medium/long term, have serious coverage gaps in the Asia and Pacific
region. These programs normally cover the larger enterprises in the formal
sector. Smaller employers, particularly in industries that compete with the
informal sector, are often excluded from many of the provisions, as are
household workers, daily laborers, farmers, fishermen, and many urban
self-employed. The informal sector thus operates outside the scope of regulations, with low and unstable levels of income, and poor working conditions. The result of the statutory exclusions is that many of the most
vulnerable people are not protected.
53. The first priorities for the poor and the informal sector are strengthening prospects of survival and improving incomes, rather than investing
scarce resources in social insurance schemes. The poor normally have
shorter lives due to hardship—only 5% of the Asia and Pacific population is
over 65. Additionally, old people in the informal sector who are fortunate
enough to live beyond that age do not retire but are likely to remain economically active as long as they can, to support themselves and help their
families survive. Efforts to expand coverage should start by addressing the
needs of the poor and informal sector clientele: improvement of their productive potential and their employment and income-generating capacity,
improvement of the household’s welfare, and mitigation of risks that keep
households in poverty. A major area of development for informal sector
groups in both urban and rural areas is microinsurance for health care,
death of the breadwinner, and short-term risks, through voluntary schemes
established by mutual benefit societies, cooperatives, and similar organizations, or civil society groups that rely on trust engendered through occupational groupings or community solidarity.
54. Even where most formal employees and self-employed people are
covered according to the statute, the reality may be quite different due to
poor enforcement. Lax enforcement often has the same impact as a statutory exclusion. Where enforcement is lacking or lax, labor market regulations are likely to have little impact even for those who are nominally covered.
Poor enforcement can also undermine the protection offered under contributory social insurance, since benefit entitlements usually depend to some
degree on how contributions have been collected. A close link between
contribution payment and subsequent benefit entitlement helps to insulate a contributory program from the financial consequences of poor

39

enforcement, but does this by reducing benefits and restricting protection.
Effective enforcement requires institutions that have the necessary statutory authority to establish liabilities and enforce collections. These institutions must also have adequate operating budgets, the willingness and ability
to use their resources and authority to enforce the law, and the political
support necessary to sustain the enforcement effort. For this reason,
assessing social protection coverage necessarily involves assessing the
effectiveness of the implementing institutions.
55. Market-based schemes have often found servicing low-income communities unattractive, as compared to the higher returns received from servicing higher income groups. The poor have discontinuous income and are
more prone to risk, thus the higher transaction costs are unattractive to
insurance companies and customers. Efforts should be made by governments to arrange public-private partnerships that offer low-income communities access to social protection services.
56. Adequacy of Benefits. Many systems in the Asia and Pacific region
are underbudgeted or receive erratic yearly funds so that the benefits they
provide do not achieve their intended social objective. Often, the transaction costs are larger than the benefits provided. It is critical that social protection systems are built to effectively provide protection given available
resources. On the other hand, benefits should not be so generous that they
generate disincentives. Continuity and predictability about the conditions
under which benefits are to be provided and the approximate amount to
be made available is also necessary in order to realize the social gains promised by social protection programs.

2.

Targeting vulnerable population groups and gender issues

57. Where formal systems do not have sufficient human and financial
resources to cover identified needs, the priority will be to target available
resources to vulnerable groups. Progressively, comprehensive social protection systems will be developed but, in the short term, resources will be
channeled to those most in need. Matching the results of the social expenditure reviews and vulnerability analysis will show the need to either pursue the development of a formal social protection system or concentrate
scarce resources into priority needs. When the vulnerability analysis shows
high child/adult dependency ratios and children exposed to risks, the
country’s social protection system should target children. When most
vulnerable people live in the rural areas, resources should be decentralized

40

Box 7: Expansion of Social Protection Coverage in Japan
Since the 1880s, when Japan’s Meiji revolution modernized the country,
mutual aid societies were formed to protect workers in leading industrial
and mining companies. However, poverty was a widespread phenomenon
in rural areas; after World War I and the Great Depression, the economic
crisis raised the levels of rural household poverty. In the 1920s, the Japanese Government asserted that poverty was a sign of backwardness and
that modernization required the eradication of poverty. The main social
protection policies on which Japan based its poverty reduction strategy
were (i) labor markets, mostly wage and employment policies; and (ii) social
insurance, focusing on health. The Japanese embraced the principle of
full employment as a value to be preserved in a stable society and labor
market imbalances were seen as a national problem. As Japan developed
and industrial restructuring was needed, the Government supported firm’s
skills upgrading and training programs to preserve employment and find
alternative production suitable for the changing market. In 1922, the Diet
(the Japanese Parliament) passed the first health insurance law, modeled
on the German sickness funds. The lack of adequate and affordable medical care had been a focal point of the peasants’ protest, as many farmers
suffered from starvation, malnutrition, and infectious diseases associated
with poor living conditions. In the 1930s, the Japanese community health
insurance scheme was supported by a 50% government subsidy, with a
planned reduction of the subsidy as society modernized. Local societies
were required to provide primary health care but left free to set contribution rates and decide on optional additional benefits. Most provided
maternity benefits while a few also opted for funeral grants. Societies built
clinics and employed medical staff. These societies eventually numbered
10,000 and formed the basis of the Japanese national health scheme—full insurance coverage was achieved in 1961. At the end of the twentieth
century, Japan had accomplished the lowest infant mortality rate and highest life expectancy in the world. The success of the Japanese experience
suggests some good development practices—the first being that poverty
reduction requires political commitment and active government budgetary and technical support. It is interesting to note also that employment
and primary healthcare were the first social protection priorities.

and programs be put in place to target these priority population groups. A
distribution analysis, as pointed out in the following section, should ensure
any proposed social protection program achieves its targeted objectives.
58. Special consideration should be paid to gender issues. Although half
of the population are women, they receive much less assistance and

41

opportunities than do men. Many poverty reduction and social development programs are focused on households and do not consider
intrahousehold differences. Assets and labor are normally distributed in a
different and unequal manner between men and women, boys and girls
within a same household. Unless particular attention is paid to women’s
unique problems and life patterns when social protection policies and programs are developed, approaches that might appear to be gender-neutral
may actually disadvantage women. Positive discrimination maybe needed
to ensure women’s development in Asia and the Pacific. For example, labor
market reforms must go beyond a purely traditional agenda to adequately
address such special concerns of women as a higher incidence of home
work, competing demands from household responsibilities, and the particular needs surrounding child bearing. In child protection, the benefits of
investing in the girl child are large—educated girls become more responsible and better informed mothers. Social insurance programs need to be
designed to take into account the longer life expectancies of women in
most societies; the additional implications for women of the risk of loss of
support due to death, abandonment, or divorce; and the less stable earning
patterns commonly found among women.
59. The most vulnerable populations are often not reflected in household
surveys—migrant workers, orphans, the homeless, victims of disasters, refugees, nomads and marginalized indigenous groups. These groups may
require special attention owing to both extreme poverty and social exclusion. As with women, they may be seriously disadvantaged by programs
that appear otherwise to be uniform and fair, owing to the effects of labor
market discrimination and alternative cultural traditions. Special outreach
strategies are normally required for those.

3.

Sustainability and good governance

60. The design of any social protection scheme is directly linked to an
analysis of how it can be financed and how it can best be delivered. There
is no prescription or preferred social protection model, as the structure and
operations will change from country to country depending on the available
financial and institutional resources. Social protection interventions should
include assessments of how to ensure efficient and sustainable operations
to deliver the proposed coverage of social protection needs.
61. Financing Sources. The variety of social protection programs (labor
markets, social insurance, social assistance/welfare services, micro and

42

area-based schemes, and child protection) may be financed through budgetary support, income-related contributions, charitable donations, or a mix
of all these. Enforcement of revenue collection may result in higher tax collections, particularly in countries with young demographic pyramids. Higher
tax revenues can in turn support the promotion of statutory programs. In
addition to encouraging adequate tax collection, there is merit in systems
in which individuals cofinance services, contributing individually or through
community-based arrangements. This is the case for social insurance, micro
and area-based schemes, social funds, and selected labor market and child
protection programs. However, most programs, particularly those targeted
to lower income groups, require a degree of public support. Financing from
charitable or aid organizations is discontinuous and does not allow sustainable social protection programs. Such financing may help to fill the gaps
on a temporary basis only. In social insurance programs, accumulated savings/contributions can be invested in financial markets.16 Diversification of
income sources is desirable to spread risks and ensure the overall
sustainability of the program.
62. Potential financial commitments under a program need to be evaluated
to be sure that they can be borne from the resources likely to be available,
including the program’s contingent liabilities.17 Will insurance premiums
cover projected losses? Will sufficient resources be available to cover operating costs once a facility has been created for delivering social services?
63. Redistribution Issues. Financing issues are directly linked to distribution aspects. The design of any social protection program should carefully
evaluate its distribution impacts to (i) ensure that vulnerable and poor benefit; and (ii) above all, avoid regressive redistribution issues, e.g., building
systems with public resources that mostly benefit upper income groups.
Since the main objective of a social protection system is to support
16

17

Relying on capital market returns to help finance pension costs can reduce the size of the
contributions needed, but as illustrated by the recent economic crisis, can also introduce
greater variance in the amount of protection offered.
Many social insurance programs, including those operated directly by the government
and those operated by the private sector under a government mandate, incorporate some
form of minimum guarantee by the government—the guarantees may be of minimum
incomes, minimum benefits, or the financial solvency of private financial intermediaries.
The guarantees may be either explicit in the law or implicit in the way the political system
operates. In either case, they create contingent liabilities, which come due if the social
protection programs fail to supply the guaranteed degree of protection. Analyses of social
protection policies too often ignore the size and expected cost of these contingent liabilities, and may result in costly reforms.

43

vulnerable populations to overcome their exposure to risks, it results in more
equitable societies. Financing social protection systems implies some transfer of resources, either from taxed citizens to those outside the formal sector, or from the working age generation to younger and older people. Even
when building contributory social insurance schemes, the normally expensive transition costs are passed to the public sector and thus financed by
taxpayers. This does not imply that the purpose of a social protection system is merely income redistribution—the purpose is to build mechanisms
that assist individuals to overcome vulnerability; for this, a degree of redistribution and support is needed. Identifying the adequate mix of financing
resources to ensure, if needed, adequate redistribution and support to vulnerable populations should be assessed after careful cost-benefit evaluation of the proposed social protection program.
64. Social protection success depends on the effective administration
of adequately designed programs. Common operational problems among
agencies include corruption, cronyism, and favoritism; inadequate information processing, storage and retrieval systems; and organizational cultures that are hostile to customer service. Good governance is crucial for
sound macroeconomic management, progressive taxation, and equitable
allocations of funds for social development. The impact of basic social services is reduced by governance defects such as inadequate budgets and
wasteful, inefficient, and unresponsive administrations. The poor suffer most
due to poor access, low bargaining power, and little influence on local
officialdom and service providers. The effects of such deficiencies in governance are exemplified by the highly unsatisfactory coverage in social
insurance schemes. These schemes have been in force for decades in many
countries but have failed to reach those most in need of protection. Fundamental governance issues that should be considered when designing any
social protection scheme include identifying (i) the most appropriate social
protection system to serve all citizens, (ii) the most suitable institutional
arrangements for the administration of schemes, and (iii) the best way to
achieve operational efficiency.
65. Institutional Structure. Often, public social protection programs do
not have sufficient human and financial resources to cover identified needs.
Most DMCs need to allow flexible and innovative institutional arrangements,
bringing all possible development partners together under well-regulated
sectoral policies, government’s administrative oversight to ensure good
governance and affordable services. The four main social protection delivery

44

mechanisms are (i) public-based, normally best to achieve expansion of
coverage; (ii) market-based, normally best for efficient delivery for the formal sector of the economy and voluntary schemes for higher income groups;
(iii) NGOs and charitable institutions, normally good to target low-income
communities; and (iv) a mix of these. However, each mechanism has
important limitations. A summary is presented in Table 4. The public sector
should not crowd out the potential role of the private sector in delivering
social protection. Instead, the public sector should concentrate its efforts to
serve areas and populations that are not covered by the private sector.
Decentralization of public programs offers the great potential to improve
effectiveness of social programs and bring decision making closer to communities. The private sector is often not attracted to lower income groups
and/or remote areas because the associated transaction costs are high and
returns low. Private-public partnerships can be agreed between governments and private companies to secure inclusion of those excluded from
any form of protection. Where NGOs are already significant providers of
social protection programs, they can be encouraged to continue. However,
NGOs often have limited and discontinuous funding and their presence is
scattered, and normally not broad enough to ensure equal expansion of
coverage, limiting their ability to reduce vulnerability. A mixed delivery system may be best to diversify risks and address social protection priorities.
66. Avoiding excessive administrative charges is a major challenge for
certain kinds of social protection programs. Administrative charges siphon
away resources from the intended beneficiaries, needlessly increasing the
cost of social protection and reducing society’s capacity for providing
protection. In addition to the threat they pose to program integrity, inefficient and unresponsive government bureaucracies often cause excessive
administrative costs. The result is administrative resources wasted due to
duplicative and inefficient service delivery structures.
67. Cost-Effectiveness. The development of social protection programs
may be affected by the different viewpoints on the positive and negative
links between social protection and economic development. It is easier to
calculate the costs borne by taxpayers or contributors in the short term
than to assess the advantages gained from each program. Expenditures on
children and youth through education, health, and training programs are
all investments in future generations, critical for long-term growth and poverty reduction. Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of social protection programs requires an impartial assessment of the following issues: (i) the cost

45

of the programs (as a percentage of gross domestic product and total public expenditure), including contingent liabilities as a result of possible
government guarantees to the programs; (ii) performance (the percentage
of vulnerable targeted groups covered by the programs, the percent of
benefits going to poor and nonpoor groups, and the extent to which the
benefits are adequate to servicing identified needs); (iii) administrative cost
(the administrative cost as a percentage of the total cost, and how the cost
compares with other programs); (iv) long-term social benefits; and (v) feasible options to improve cost-effectiveness, including the cost to society
(determining who pays for reforms and which groups benefit from the proposed reform agenda). Careful attention should be paid to the comparative
value of social protection interventions against other necessary social
development programs (e.g., health, education, and rural development
programs). Social protection programs should be developed after careful
evaluation of the country-specific priorities to reduce poverty.

4.

Integrated approach to social protection

68. Social protection should be seen as one of several measures that work
together to promote socially inclusive human development, reduce poverty, and support enhanced productivity and growth. Close collaboration is
needed to ensure that social protection and other development policies
are consistent and mutually supportive. Many problems of existing social
protection programs are due to lack of cohesion in social and economic
planning or inconsistencies between different parts of the social protection
system. For instance, serious difficulties in the labor market may lead to
proposals for early retirement on advantageous terms as a part of the solution to over-employment in public enterprises, but without sufficient consideration of the long-term implications for pension funds. Another example
of malpractice could be social protection interventions displacing necessary health and education investments. Integrated and coordinated
national policies on social protection must be established. Sound policy
formulation in social protection requires less emphasis on short-term priorities and the creation of medium- and long-term social development plans.
Close coordination in policy formulation is vital when several government
departments and agencies are involved.
69. Consulting institutions such as DMC’s National Social Protection
Coordination Commissions, with responsibility for strategic planning and
coordination, can facilitate the formulation of an overall strategy for strengthening social protection. If inexistent or ineffective, such bodies can be

46

created. This integrated planning machinery should include government,
external funding agencies, and civil society groups in order to achieve consensus on priorities, objectives, and the necessity for encouraging pro-poor
sustainable growth and social development. The role of ministries of finance
and national planning authorities is crucial in working out balanced views
on realistic and affordable priorities with the ministries directly responsible
for the management and development of programs. Dialogues on these
matters can improve mutual understanding of the wide range of issues
involved, and the right sequencing of reforms. Aid agencies could provide
necessary advise and help generate a consensus. Integrated planning is
complex but essential for policy cohesion and the efficient use of resources.
Controversial issues, including the extent of redistributive policies, changes
in policies on subsidies in particular sectors, and increases in pension ages
should be settled through this process. This participatory approach is critical to ensure long-term success.

IV. Operational
implications
A. Investing in social protection
70. Rationale. The overarching mission of ADB is to help its DMCs achieve
accelerated and irreversible reductions in poverty. Social protection, as part
of social development, the second pillar of the ADB Poverty Reduction Strategy, is an integral component of that mission by assisting vulnerable populations to better manage risks and develop their human capital. Since 1985,
ADB has assisted its DMCs to improve their social protection systems. The
share of social protection interventions have increased noticeably in the
total ADB portfolio, particularly since 1995. Of the social protection portfolio, investments have centered on labor markets (39% of volume), micro
and area-based approaches to protect communities (27%), and child protection (19%). ADB will continue to support its DMCs in their efforts to reduce
poverty and provide effective protection for the Asia and Pacific population
in the social protection subsectors that ADB has demonstrated expertise.
71. Regional Need for Reforms. Asia and the Pacific is a largely young,
rural, and poor region: social protection programs and policies should be
built to respond to its needs. The region is still experiencing the effects of
the demographic explosion and 40% of its population is below 19. The
region’s population is 3.1 billion, half of the world’s total, and of this, 900
million people are poor. About 60% of the total population live in rural areas
and most of the population belongs to the informal sector. The majority of
DMCs have some form of institutionalized social protection system; however, most social protection programs have low effectivity due to limited
coverage, insufficient funds, and inadequate instruments. Most employees
in the informal sector are unable or unwilling to contribute a relatively high
percentage of their incomes to financing social protection benefits that do
not meet their priority needs. In general, the informal sector prioritizes
immediate needs, such as health, employment or the source of livelihood,

49

shelter, food, clothing, and survival from natural disasters, rather than
traditional social security schemes such as old-age insurance. A host of
other factors restrict access to statutory social protection schemes, including legal impediments, administrative bottlenecks, and problems with compliance. Reforming existing social security systems to extend protection to
the majority of citizens in the Asia and Pacific region is a critical priority.
72. Economic Justification. Welfare systems have not been a priority for
most DMC policymakers in the Asia and Pacific region; social protection
has been largely neglected, or at best addressed with inadequate resources.
However, a closer look at economic history shows that the most advanced
economies of the region—Japan; Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea;
Singapore; and Taipei,China—built development policies through active
public or public-private interventions in medical care, social and housing
assistance, minimum retirement levels, and education. Investing in social
protection was an essential part in the modernization programs of these
wealthier societies at the early stages of their development. Precisely, higher
levels of social security allowed high productivity gains in the workforce,
expanded domestic demand, and increased economic growth. Social protection is a logical extension of ADB’s overarching objective to reduce poverty because the benefits of economic growth will not automatically reach
to all poor. Lack of adequate social protection may actually put a severe
limit on future economic growth. In children, malnutrition and poverty damage health, cause death, harm reproduction, reduce intelligence, and lower
productivity and opportunities for the future adult, a high tax on future economic development. Social protection is an economic need in the Asia and
Pacific region.
73. Priorities. The social protection priorities for the Asia and Pacific region
in the period 2000–2015 are the design of sound, comprehensive social protection programs to effectively reduce poverty and vulnerability, including
(i) interventions to protect communities and the informal sector; (ii) child
protection; and (iii) labor market programs to ensure productive employment, good working conditions and improved human capital development.
In its policy dialogue, ADB will encourage DMC governments to improve
social protection systems and shift away from funding activities that either
benefit the wealthy upper income groups or that have low benefit-cost ratios.
The specific country priorities will be determined in the country poverty
analyses and country strategic programs. Investments in social protection
should never undermine necessary expenditures for other social development areas such as education and health.

Institutions

• Lower costs
• Near vulnerable groups, programs
offered based on household and
community needs
• Quick and flexible in implementation
• Use participatory approaches with
vulnerable groups

Mixed

System

• Use strengths of each provider;
may be a best option given a mixed
system spreads both the risks and
opportunities for success
• Provide common, consistent set of
national social protection policies
combined with flexible local
programs to meet local needs
• Enables some form of redistribution
to occur to balance poorest and
wealthiest regions in countries

Disadvantages
• Unable to pool larger area
risks (e.g., agricultural)
• Poorer regions suffer from
lower revenue base and
therefore smaller spending base
• Untrained and inexperienced
staff in policy design,
development, monitoring and
evaluation
• Less knowledgeable of local
circumstances and needs
• Takes longer to implement
programs
• Risk of limited efficiency and
governance problems

• Not serving low-income groups
given high transaction costs and
low returns
• Insurance premiums and service
costs are not affordable to the
poor
• As government normally
guarantees minimum incomes/
benefits, if companies become
financially insolvent the state may
have to provide financial support
• Inconsistent nationally therefore
questionable regarding issues of
equity
• Sporadic funding and
discontinuous programs, affecting
the overall effectivity of their
interventions
• Limited efficiency and
uncoordinated delivery
• No consistent evaluation,
monitoring, audits, or
accountability
• May be more costly to maintain
involvement of all providers
• Can create competition rather
than cooperation between service
providers

attached to basic education or
health projects, reenforcing the
development effectiveness of interventions, as requested by ADB Board of
Directors in recent sector policies.18
75. Project Lending vs. Program Lending: ADB assistance in social protection should focus on project lending, or a combination of project and
program lending, with selective technical assistance. Particular attention
needs to be paid to (i) the development of in-country capacity to sustain
interventions, and (ii) the creation of domestic expertise to monitor performance and the extent to which interventions meet their objectives. Care
must be taken to ensure a balance between the two areas. Experience shows
that one of the most common causes of failure in social protection lending
is a result of the lack of attention to these aspects. Program lending alone is
not an adequate instrument and good practice to develop social protection
systems.

B. Operational implications for ADB
76. Within ADB operations, social protection issues arise in seven contexts: (i) country poverty analysis and programming strategies, (ii) ADB
project activities, (iii) safeguards, (iv) staffing and staff skills, (v) operational
assignments and responsibilities, (vi) strategic partnerships, and (vii) monitoring progress.

1.

ADB country poverty analysis and country strategy and
program

77. The decision on whether ADB should assist a specific DMC to address
social protection priorities will require an assessment of social protection
issues and priorities in the context of the country poverty analysis, to be
reflected in the country strategy and program. The assessments should be
brief and concise, attending to the objective of prioritizing which interventions, if any, maybe necessary for a specific DMC. Given the variety of reform
priorities and possible interventions (labor markets, social insurance, social
assistance, area-based schemes, and child protection), the ADB Social Protection Strategy recommends prioritizing investments based on ADB’s
goals19 of reducing poverty, promoting country focus and ownership,
enhancing strategic alliances and partnerships, and having a long-term
approach. This is summarized below:
(i)

Country Needs. The country needs assessment will include a vulnerability profile and labor market analysis, and will conclude with a
rational prioritization of the country’s top social protection needs,
based on quantitative evidence. The summary vulnerability and risk
profile will identify the main causes of vulnerability and social risks,
and quantify affected populations by age group, geographical area,
and other relevant criteria. A summary labor market analysis will
critically review the capacity of the labor market to absorb new entrants
and recommend ways to ensure efficient and inclusive development
patterns. Such an analysis is a key element in the poverty assessment’s
strategic link to economic growth.

(ii)

Available Resources. The resources available for social protection
programs will be assessed in a social expenditure review as part of
the country governance assessment,20 in coordination with the ILO,
IMF, World Bank, and aid assistance organizations. Social expenditure reviews evaluate the capacity of current support programs in
assessing the effectivity of current allocations to reduce poverty and
vulnerability, including distribution issues. Many existing social protection systems and programs are underbudgeted or their benefits
mistargeted to upper-/middle-income groups; the level of resources

available for social protection will influence a country’s social
protection choices.
(iii) Existing Institutions. The efficiency and coverage of existing social
protection programs, and the possible roles, and risks involved, in using
public and market-based and civil society/NGO mechanisms will be
evaluated to assess the feasibility of new social protection programs.
(iv) Political Economy of Reform. Social protection strategies are complex
undertakings in which some groups may benefit more than others—
reforms should be articulated in an integrated manner and discussed
with all relevant stakeholders.
78. ADB operations may appropriately include social protection lending
and nonlending activities to serve country-specific needs. The proposed
social protection policies should complement one another and help countries to meet their international commitments for poverty reduction and
social development (e.g., International Development Goals, Basic Social
Services 20:20,21 and UN conventions and laws).

2.

Strategic guiding principles for ADB
social protection activities

79. ADB interventions in social protection should be selective. If any social protection intervention (labor markets, social insurance, social assistance, micro and area-based schemes, or child protection) has been
identified as a priority in a DMC, the project should ensure the following:
(i)

Adequate Coverage. Formal social protection systems should be built
with the ultimate objective of ensuring effective protection for the
majority of the population so poverty and vulnerability are effectively
reduced; this is a top priority in Asia and the Pacific as most citizens
are excluded from any formal social protection system.

(ii)

Targeting Vulnerable Population Groups and Gender Issues. Where
allocated public funds are limited and country needs are large, public
programs will likely be unable to provide adequate coverage; resources
should thus be targeted to those most in need. Priority vulnerable
groups will have been identified and prioritized in the country’s vulnerability profile. Given the status of women in the region, gender

services.

development, including positive discrimination policies, deserve
particular attention to ensure inclusive societies.
(iii) Sustainability and Good Governance. Sound financial management,
good governance; and adequate institutional arrangements are
essential to secure effective administration and minimize charges and
impacts on the budget. Evaluating the distribution impacts and costeffectiveness of interventions will further assist in determining priorities and economic and social benefits.
(iv) Integrated Approach. Establishing or consulting existing National
Commissions for Social Protection is the best institutional mechanism
to ensure consistency across programs, appropriate prioritization of
in-country social protection needs, and adequate sequencing of
reforms.
80. The principles described in the earlier sections are also applicable to
social protection components in loans where social protection is not the
direct objective of the loan.
81. Examples of ADB’s role in technical assistance and lending programs
for the priority social protection interventions include
(i)

aligning current social protection programs to ensure that available
resources serve priority needs;

(ii)

assisting governments to improve labor market operations to reduce
poverty, facilitate human development, address gender inequalities,
remove obstacles to job creation, improve productivity, and create an
environment enabling economic activity;

(iii) continuing to support direct interventions that contribute to the elimination of violations of the Core Labor Standards;
(iv) expanding the role of microfinance to include new objectives such as
microinsurance and reinsurance;
(v)

promoting the development of social funds;

(vi) designing projects that empower communities and develop disaster
preparedness programs to secure less vulnerable and more self-reliant
communities; and
(vii) increasing child protection programs either as stand-alone projects
or components of basic education and health projects.
55

82. Social insurance and social assistance are areas where the ADB has
lesser expertise and, if any, interventions should be developed in close collaboration with strategic development partners. Such assistance might
include
(i)

rethinking pension reform programs and insurance/nonbanking financial services, to ensure that, in addition to market-based mechanisms
and sustainability aspects, pension reform programs are designed to
balance equity considerations, addressing issues such as expansion
of coverage and provision of adequate benefits to the population; and

(ii)

ensuring adequate distribution impacts in the reform of social assistance programs.

3.

Collateral issues and safeguards

83. Social protection issues also emerge as important collateral issues in
lending where social protection is not the direct objective of the loan.
Incorporating social protection dimensions in such cases and where feasible, will extend the reach of social protection concerns.
84. The existing ADB social impact assessments, mandated by Management and the Board since 1991 (Operations Manual OM 47: Incorporation
of Social Dimensions into Bank Operations) will continue to ensure that
vulnerable groups are not negatively affected by an ADB intervention. Specific social protection issues include the following:
(i)

vulnerable groups that maybe negatively affected by an ADB intervention must be adequately compensated and mitigation measures put
in place to avoid creating further poverty (e.g., in case of public or
private sector restructuring, workers, particularly low-income workers, should not be unfairly disadvantaged, regardless of race, skills,
gender, age, or religious and political beliefs)22 ; mitigation measures
should always aim to adequately balance social objectives and economic sustainability; and

(ii)

(a) in the design and formulation of its loans, ADB will comply with
the internationally recognized core labor standards;

22

56

Other typical examples are loans dealing with shifts toward market-determined pricing of
energy, water, telecommunications, and housing. Ideally such development interventions
should take place after appropriate regulatory institutions have been created and safety
nets established. Often, however, interim measures may have to be adopted to ease the
effects on households (e.g., tiered pricing of utilities, or exemptions from user charges).

(b) take all necessary and appropriate steps to ensure that for ADBfinanced procurement of goods and services, contractors, subcontractors and consultants will comply with the country’s labor legislation
(e.g., minimum wages, safe working conditions, and social security
contributions, etc.) as well as with the Core Labor Standards; and
(iii) As part of its regular loan reviews, ADB will monitor that (i) and (ii) are
complied with.

C. Staffing and staff skills
85. Dealing with social protection demands skills in welfare and labor
economics, social development, public administration, law, finance, economics, poverty reduction, and targeting mechanisms; and knowledge and/
or experience on the five components of social protection—labor markets,
social insurance, social assistance, micro and area-based schemes to protect communities and child protection. Accordingly, the skills mix required
for a “social protection specialist” would require exposure in all or most of
the above fields. Considering the high share of social protection in relation
to total ADB lending, more specialized skills in this field are required in
order to further enhance ADB’s contributions to this emerging sector; higher
costs are justified on the grounds of higher development impact.
86. The assessment of staffing and skills requirements suggests that at
least one social protection specialist will be required in the Office of Pacific
Operations and one in each of the social sector divisions of the regional
departments to provide direct operational support. In addition, one such
specialist will also be required in the central support department to ensure
implementation of the Social Protection Strategy and support networking
with other responsible divisions. The staffing needs will be met through
outside recruitment, internal reskilling, and external retraining.
87. Training programs will consist of a mix of short-term external training
for redeployed specialists, and in-house training for other ADB staff. Both
internal and external training should start in 2002. The ADB Institute should
also become an active partner in providing training to DMC officials.

57

D. Operational assignments and responsibilities
88. The implementation of the strategy will require the institutional
arrangements presented in the Action Plan, Appendix 1,23 and the following
assignment of responsibilities:
(i)

determination of country priorities: regional departments, particularly
the resident missions, and social sector divisions, assisted by the Poverty Reduction and Social Development division in the Regional and
Sustainable Development Department (RSDD);

(ii)

design of social protection interventions: social sector divisions, and
other sector divisions;

(iii) labor trade unions to have an official interlocutor at ADB’s NGO Center;
(iv) reinforcement of collateral issues and safeguards: sector divisions,
resident missions, Office of the General Counsel, operation services
offices, overview by the Poverty Reduction and Social Development
Division in RSDD;
(v)

recruitment of staff and internal training: Human Resources Division;

(vi) external training: ADB Institute, Human Resources Division;
(vii) strategic partnerships: regional departments, resident missions, social and other sector divisions, Strategy and Policy Department; and
(viii) coordination and monitoring the implementation of SPS, including
issuing of manuals and guidelines: Poverty Reduction and Social
Development Division of RSDD.

E. Strategic partnerships and coordination among
development agencies
89. ADB should consider the strategic alliances it can develop in order to
avoid duplication of efforts, mobilize additional resources, and ensure
coordination of development interventions in DMCs. Coordination
of development efforts is essential for long-term success. Strategic

23

58

The Action Plan is based on the proposed working paper Reorganization of ADB (dated
5 July 2001); if needed, the action plan will be modified to reflect Board recommendations
on ADB’s organization, and its pages replaced.

partnerships are also important to ensure optimal use of resources by coordinating the strengths of each institution in a determined DMC.
90. The Action Plan (Appendix 1) identifies specific issues with relevant
development partners. ADB has started to strengthen and formalize its collaborative efforts with other development partners such as the World Bank
and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).24 Collaborative
efforts include (i) policy dialogue and knowledge sharing, including cooperation in vulnerability profiles, labor market analyses, and social expenditure reviews; (ii) staff exchanges and joint training; and (iii) selective joint
activities at the country level. The ADB will also formalize a memorandum
of understanding with ILO.

F.

Monitoring progress

91. To monitor the development impacts of its interventions in social protection, ADB will pay increased attention to measuring the social returns of
project and policy-based lending. Loans should aim to provide, as part of
their logical framework and project performance monitoring system (i) a
set of clearly defined, objective indicators of success; and (ii) benefit incidence analysis of social protection investments. As much as possible, ADB
loans should contribute to build the capacity of DMC governments to collect, collate, and analyze social protection data to facilitate national planning and policy formulation.
92. The need for social monitoring, early warning and planning, is essential for social risk management at the macro level (e.g., to anticipate effects
of events such as economic crisis, earthquakes, and droughts). ADB will
support countries in their efforts to build capacity on social monitoring and
early response.

24

Memorandums of understanding with ILO and World Bank have been signed.
