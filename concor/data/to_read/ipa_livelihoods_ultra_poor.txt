building stable livelihoods for the ultra-poor
A multifaceted livelihood program that provided ultra-poor households with a productive asset, training, regular
coaching, access to savings, and consumption support led to large and lasting impacts on their standard of living
across a diverse set of contexts and implementing partners.

Key Results of the Graduation Approach:
A holistic livelihood program targeted at the ultra-poor helped them shift into more stable self-employment that increased their
standard of living both two years after the productive asset transfer, and three years after the asset transfer—a year or more after
all program activities ended.

The Graduation approach caused broad and lasting economic impacts. Pooled data from six sites show Graduation households’
consumption increased 5.8 percent relative to the comparison group two years after the asset transfer. Graduation households’ consumption
increased 7.3 percent in Bangladesh, 16.4 percent in Ethiopia, 6.9 percent in Ghana, 13.6 percent in India, and 10.2 percent in Pakistan
relative to the comparison group, though there was no impact on consumption in Honduras or Peru. Households experienced similar
improvements in food security, asset holdings, and savings. Most positive impacts on participating households were consistent three
years after the asset transfer—one year after all program activities ended.

The improvements in well-being were mostly the result of increases in self-employment income. Injecting a combination of
productive assets and relevant skills training led to an increase in basic entrepreneurial activities, primarily concentrated on livestock
and activities like petty trade.

Graduation led to some improvements in psychosocial well-being. Happiness, stress, women’s empowerment, and some measures
of physical health and political engagement improved for participants at some sites. The effects on women’s empowerment and physical
health were no longer statistically significant one year after all program activities ended.

These effects were consistent across multiple contexts and implementing partners. The program’s positive results on economic
well-being, which range from very economically significant to moderately so, are not driven by any one country.

context
More than one-fifth of the world’s population lives on less than US$1.25 per day. Many of these families depend on insecure and fragile
livelihoods, including casual farm and domestic labor. Their income is often irregular or seasonal, putting laborers and their families at
risk of hunger. There is an emerging international consensus to drive the share of the world’s population living in ultra-poverty to zero by
2030.1 Achieving this goal will require the poorest of the poor to shift to more secure and sustainable livelihoods.
Self-employment is often the only viable alternative to menial labor for the ultra-poor. Yet many lack the necessary cash or skills to start
a business that could earn more than casual labor. To alleviate these constraints, several international and local nongovernmental
organizations support programs that foster a transition to more secure livelihoods. Combining complementary approaches—the
transfer of a productive asset, training, consumption support, and coaching—into one comprehensive program may help spur a
sustainable transition to self-employment.
This bulletin summarizes the results from seven randomized evaluations of the Graduation approach, a multifaceted livelihood program
for the ultra-poor. This particular approach was designed by BRAC and has since been adapted in eight countries with support from
the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and the Ford Foundation. Researchers conducted randomized evaluations of the
program in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru. By evaluating a similar approach across a diverse set
of contexts and implementing partners, results shed new light on important policy questions. Can a “big push” intervention targeted
at the ultra-poor help them transition to more secure livelihoods and increase their income even after the two-year program ends? Can
the intervention also improve psychosocial well-being and empowerment? Is the Graduation approach effective when implemented
across diverse geographical, institutional, and cultural contexts?

The Graduation Approach
The Graduation approach consists of six complementary
components, each designed to address specific constraints
facing ultra-poor households.
1. Productive asset transfer: One-time transfer of productive
assets, such as cows, goats, or supplies for petty trade.
2. Technical skills training: Training to manage the
productive asset.
3. Consumption support: Regular cash or food support for a
few months to a year.
4. Savings: Access to a savings account, or encouragement
to save.
5. Home visits: Frequent home visits by implementing partner
staff to provide accountability, coaching, and encouragement.
6. Health: Health education, health care access, and/or
life skills training.
All evaluations in this bulletin include these six components; see
Table 1 for country-by-country variation in program design.

evaluation
BR AC began their Targeting the Ultra-Poor program in
Bangladesh in 2002 and it has since been replicated in several
countries. This bulletin reviews randomized evaluations of the
original program and adaptations in Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras,
India, Pakistan, and Peru, which together reached more than
seven thousand households. Together, these studies provide
rigorous evidence on the impact of a holistic two-year program
that provides ultra-poor households with a business asset,
training, consumption support, and coaching on their economic
and psychosocial well-being.
Implementing organizations attended global learning events
hosted by CGAP and the Ford Foundation and visited BRAC
in Bangladesh to ensure consistency in core program elements
across contexts. Table 1 summarizes the variations in program
design by country. Implementers tailored program design to
adapt to the local context, including government regulations
or preexisting social assistance programs.2 Since these studies
evaluate a package of interventions, researchers cannot isolate
the contribution of the individual components to the program’s
overall impact. This remains an important area for future study,
which researchers are now examining in Ghana.3
In all settings except Ethiopia, eligible households were identified
through a community participatory wealth-ranking process. 4

Implementing organizations then visited households to verify
their poverty status. The program successfully targeted ultrapoor households (see Figure 1).
Access to the Graduation program was randomly assigned at the
household, village, or branch level, depending on the site. In
Ethiopia, India, and Pakistan, the poorest households identified
through the targeting process were randomly assigned to
receive the program or serve in the comparison group. In Ghana,
Honduras, and Peru, there were two stages of randomization.
Villages were first randomly assigned to the program or
comparison group. Eligible households within program villages
were then randomly assigned to the program or comparison
group. This design allowed researchers to measure if and how
much the program affected nonparticipating households. In
Bangladesh, randomization took place at the BRAC-branch
level using a phase-in design with treatment communities
receiving the program in 2007 and comparison communities
receiving it in 2011.
There were two waves of follow-up data collection. Endline 1
occurred just after the end of the program, approximately two
years after the productive asset transfer. In every country except
Bangladesh, endline 2 occurred three years after the asset transfer
and one year after all program activities ended. In Bangladesh,
endline 2 occurred four years after the start of the program.

The program successfully targeted ultra-poor households. The proportion of households living below US$1.25 per day that were identified as eligible for the
program and included in the study sample exceeded—often by a substantial margin—the proportion of the population living below US$1.25 per day in every country.

For instance, the Ethiopian government prohibited unconditional transfers, so implementers introduced mandatory savings. Participating households made savings deposits
as if paying off a loan in the amount of the productive asset, but then were able to keep their savings at the end of the program. In Ethiopia and Peru, preexisting consumption
support programs already reached all (Ethiopia) or most (Peru) of the participants in the study. Thus in Ethiopia, the treatment group received no additional consumption
support, and in Peru the program merely filled in the gaps, i.e. only provided consumption support to those in the treatment group not enrolled in the government program.

The Ghana site varies treatment to evaluate the impact of some individual Graduation components, including assets. Study ongoing and results forthcoming.

Two papers examine the accuracy of the participatory wealth rankings implemented in these programs. Banerjee et al. (2007) examines the targeting efficiency of the
participatory rural appraisal method used by Bandhan in India, relative to the targeting of various assistance programs operated by the government of India. The method
used by Bandhan more successfully targets the poorest of the poor. Karlan and Thuysbaert (2013) examines the accuracy of a two-step process that combines participatory
wealth ranking and a household verification survey, relative to two proxy means tests, in Honduras and Peru. The targeting methods perform similarly to one another.

In India, 52% of those selected in the randomization participated in the program. According to Bandhan, the implementing organization, 35% of households declined
the offer, for two unrelated reasons. First, in some villages, a section of villagers held the (erroneous) belief that Bandhan was a Christian organization trying to convert
beneficiaries, and acceptance of the livestock constituted agreeing in some way to participating in Christian rituals. Second, some wives were worried that their husband
would mishandle the asset and they would lose face in front of their village. A further 13% were deemed ineligible by Bandhan because they were participating in microcredit
or self-help group activities. In Bangladesh the difference between women originally classified as eligible and women who were eventually treated is due to both BRAC
program officers changing the originally classification when assets were transfered, and some women refusing the transfer.

results
1. The Graduation program caused broad and lasting economic impacts.
Every group of economic outcomes improved significantly relative to the comparison group immediately after the two-year
program ended (endline 1), and all economic outcomes saw similar gains a year after program activities ended (endline 2).
These results were not driven by any one country or by any one outcome variable within each index. Indeed, most individual
variables showed significant impacts after the Graduation program ended.
The Graduation approach increased ultra-poor households’ consumption, a common measure of well-being. Pooled estimates of
participants’ per capita consumption from the six replication studies increased 0.12 standard deviations (5.8 percent) at endline 1
relative to comparison households.9 At endline 2, the impact persisted with per capita consumption 0.12 standard deviations (4.9
percent) higher than the comparison group. See Figure 2 for the change in consumption in each country. Direct consumption
support alone does not account for these increases, as consumption support lasted for no more than one year in any program,
and in Ethiopia the comparison group received the same consumption support as the treatment group. Instead, the authors
suggest increased consumption is a result of increasing self-employment activity (see Result 2).

Consistent with increasing food expenditure, household members were able to afford two meals per day more often. Across the
six sites, a pooled index of food security increased 0.11 standard deviations at endline 1, and 0.11 standard deviations at endline 2,
meaning that families experienced fewer days in which a member of the household skipped meals or went a whole day without
food. Pooled indices mask some variation—for instance, there were no significant improvements in food security in Ghana or
Peru at endline 1, and no improvements in Pakistan or Honduras at endline 2. Figure 3 shows the country-by-country impact of
Graduation on food security.

Consumption is defined as food plus nonfood expenditures.

Since release of the Science publication, Peru data has been revised slightly. Peru results presented in this bulletin are therefore slightly different than those in Science.

Transferring a productive asset increased household assets:
despite being free to sell these assets after the program ended,
treated households continued to own more livestock than
households in the comparison group. Total assets increased
significantly in all sites at endline 1—two years after the
assets were transferred—with the exception of Honduras,
and at endline 2, with the exception of Honduras and Peru.
In Honduras, 83 percent of beneficiaries chose chickens,
many of which died of illness, resulting in a significant
decline in asset holdings by endline 2. In India, asset
holdings increased 65 percent at endline 1, and by 71 percent
at endline 2. That increased asset holdings should persist
after program assistance was withdrawn in most countries
shows that targeted poor households successfully operated
their businesses independently. Further demonstrating
the effects of the program, targeted women in Bangladesh
increased land ownership by 38 percent, a key security asset
in rural communities. See Figure 4 for the country-by-country
impact of Graduation on the total value of household assets.

Savings increased significantly and persistently, and gains
were largest in countries with mandatory savings. One feature
of the program was the encouragement, or in some cases a
requirement, to save. In Bangladesh, where savings groups
were formed but there was no formal savings requirement,
households experienced a tenfold increase in savings relative
to comparison households. This gain was sustained at endline
2, two years after program activities ended. In pooled estimates
from Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, and Peru, Graduation
households saved 156 percent more than the comparison
group. At endline 2, savings balances were 85 percent greater
than comparison households. Ethiopia, where savings were
mandatory, saw the greatest gains.

11

Figures 3 and 4 do not include results from Bangladesh, because that study did not use comparable indices for food security or assets.

12

Figures 3 and 4 show the impact of Graduation expressed as change in standard deviations. For instance, in Figure 3, an impact expressed in standard deviations shows
how far the Graduation approach shifted the average food security of households in the treatment group within the distribution of food security in the comparison group.
Standard deviations allow comparisons of outcomes across different contexts.

2. The Graduation program caused an increase in
self-employment income.
The program’s economic impacts were driven by an increase
in basic entrepreneurial activities, which enabled the poor
to spend more time working each day. Adults invited to
participate in Graduation spent more time each day working
on livestock and agricultural activities. The combination of
more assets and more labor translated into 42 percent more
revenue from livestock relative to the comparison group
at endline 1, and 33 percent more revenue from livestock at
endline 2, a year after Graduation activities ended. In India
and Ethiopia, revenues from livestock increased nearly fourfold
at endline 1. At endline 1 in Bangladesh, all eligible women
in treated communities were in the labor force, and almost
all engaged in some form of self-employment. At endline 2,
these occupational changes persisted and the targeted poor
had reduced their reliance on activities with seasonal
earnings by 12 percent.13

Evaluations of two programs that transferred productive assets and skills in Uganda found a similar shift up the occupational ladder from subsistence agriculture and into
skilled trades. See Blattman et al. (2013; 2014).

3. Psychosocial well-being improved, but in some
cases these noneconomic impacts did not persist
after Graduation ended.
Graduation improved psychosocial well-being, suggesting
that eligible households perceived a change in their economic
lives. In Bangladesh, life satisfaction improved significantly
at endline 2, an increase of 15 percent on a scale of reported
life satisfaction relative to the comparison group. In Ethiopia,
Ghana, Honduras, India, and Peru, self-reported happiness,
stress, and one measure of physical health improved at
endline 1. At endline 2, the impact on the mental health index
remained positive and significant, driven by self-reported
happiness and lack of stress. By endline 2, the effects on
physical health were not significantly different between
participants and the comparison group. These results
raise questions about whether the program’s impacts on
subjective well-being persist as strongly as its economic impacts.
Beneficiaries, who were at the outset often marginalized
within their communities, became more likely to be involved
in political activity. These results persisted at endline 2. While
women reported greater input on some household financial
decisions at endline 1, the impact of the Graduation approach
on women’s empowerment was not significant a year later.

No statistically significant difference

4. Graduation was consistently effective across
most contexts and implementing partners.
The Graduation program was effective in diverse contexts,
suggesting that ultra-poor households may face similar
constraints in different countries. The program’s positive results
were not driven by any one country. The magnitude of the
program’s economic impacts ranged from large and positive
to moderately positive across the seven countries, despite
implementation by many different nonprofit organizations.
The program had the largest impact on ultra-poor households
in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and India. Researchers suggest that
income diversification may have been a factor that led to the
strong and persistent effects on treated households in these
three countries. In Honduras, the program had no significant
impact on consumption and a negative impact on assets relative
to comparison households. There, the death of a large fraction
of chickens, the most commonly chosen asset, explains these
results. Even in Peru, where results were smallest across all
families of outcomes, the program led to positive and significant
impacts on food expenditures, assets, livestock revenues,
physical and mental health, and microenterprise income, an
indication of diversification. See Figures 2–4 and Table 2 for
country-by-country impact of graduation on key outcomes.
In the three countries where spillovers were measured—Ghana,
Honduras, and Peru—researchers did not find strong evidence
that the program affected comparison households in communities
where some households received the program. This finding
suggests that the program did not measurably harm or benefit
other ultra-poor households that did not participate.

Cost-benefit analysis: Graduation’s long-run benefits outweigh up-front costs
Cost-benefit calculations confirm that long-run benefits for the ultra-poor outweigh the Graduation program’s up-front costs (see Figure 5).
To calculate total program costs, authors add direct-transfer costs, supervision costs, start-up expenses, and overhead in year-three equivalent
Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) dollars.15 They define benefits as the increase in total consumption.16 They define returns as total benefits as a
percentage of total program cost. Graduation performs well by this standard in all countries except Honduras, with some sites producing
gains far greater than the amount invested.

Scaling up the Graduation Approach
The Graduation approach has been adapted to support a transition to sustainable livelihoods for ultra-poor families in about twenty countries.
The seven Graduation adaptations in this bulletin together reached more than seven thousand households, and scale-ups of the approach
will reach many thousands more in the coming years. By 2016 the Bangladesh program will have reached 650,000 ultra-poor women, and a
scale-up of the Graduation program is underway in Pakistan. In Ethiopia, the Graduation approach is being incorporated into the national
Productive Safety Net Program, which will reach an estimated 675,000 households across the country with a livelihoods program based on
the Graduation program tested as part of this research. Based on rigorous evidence of the impact of the Graduation approach, Development
Innovation Ventures has committed funding to expand the program to several states in India through a foundation established by Bandhan,
the implementing partner on the evaluation in India.

Figure 5 reports program costs per participant in USD 2014 exchange rate terms, calculated as if all costs were incurred immediately at the beginning of the program.

15

In India, where take-up was only 52 percent, program costs represent the cost per person who received the program. Take-up was 87 percent in Bangladesh and 100 percent
in all other sites (see Table 1 and footnote 7 for more detail on take-up in India).

16

Benefits are the sum of observed consumption and estimated future consumption. The future consumption estimate assumes that total consumption gains observed at
endline 2 exist in perpetuity. Researchers are doing a follow-up survey in India to see if consumption gains persist over the longer-term.

open questions
Open Questions for Future Research
The seven studies featured in this bulletin find that the Graduation
approach helped ultra-poor beneficiaries shift into more stable self
employment that improved their standard of living both two and three
years after the program began. There are still several important
questions for researchers and policymakers to consider:
• How does the Graduation approach affect specific populations?
The Graduation approach likely has substantial positive impacts on
some households and less impact on others. Understanding the effects
of the Graduation approach on different types of eligible households
can help to improve targeting of the program.

michael rizzo

• Which components of the Graduation approach drive results?
Since these evaluations study a package of interventions, it is not possible to isolate which components of the intervention drive
results. Future research can shed light on the most effective and cost-effective mix of program components.
• How important are mental health, aspirations, and community support?
More research is needed to understand the interaction between psychosocial well-being, community support, and other components
of the Graduation approach. Would strengthening those components of the approach lead to even stronger impacts, or would
removing these components lead to a more cost-effective program?
• How does the Graduation approach affect others in the community and nearby communities?
Although limited effects were found in the initial studies, several channels of indirect effects may exist and are worthy of further
study, including effects on prices, labor supply, and risk sharing.
• How do the impacts of the Graduation approach evolve over a longer time horizon?
Evidence on longer-term impacts will help to inform comparative cost-benefit analyses of Graduation and alternative approaches
that target the ultra-poor.

policy lessons
Efforts to foster increased income from self-employment among
the world’s poorest households have generally had disappointing
results. A randomized evaluation of the original Graduation
program along with evaluations of six adaptations of the program
provide important evidence that the multifaceted livelihood
program is effective at spurring a transition into self-employment
across diverse contexts and implementing agencies.

Policymakers seeking a program to sustainably improve
the lives of the ultra-poor should consider investing
in the Graduation approach. Together, evaluations of
Graduation suggest that a “big push” intervention caused
broad improvements in key dimensions of economic and
noneconomic well-being in most countries where it was tested.
Many of these effects were sustained even after assistance was
withdrawn—most outcomes persisted one to two years after
the program ended. These findings are consistent with other
similar studies. For instance, evaluations of two programs
in Uganda that provided cash transfers, skills training, and
support for entrepreneurship found similar economic impacts.
The Graduation program can also foster social mobility: in
Bangladesh, eligible households overtook the near-poor on
many key outcomes, and the impact of the program went a
long way towards closing the gap between the treated poor
and the middle class.

Long-run benefits of the Graduation approach outweigh
up-front costs. Comparing the program’s economic benefits
to its total costs, researchers find a positive rate of return three
years after the asset transfer in all contexts except Honduras,
ranging from 133 to 433 percent.

While more expensive than cash transfers, there is evidence
that the Graduation approach creates sustained change in
the lives of the ultra-poor. Pooled estimates of the Graduation
program find no decrease in impact on consumption per capita
at the end of the program—two years after the asset transfer—
or one year after all program activities ended. How do these
impacts compare to the less costly approach of simply giving
beneficiaries cash? A rigorous evaluation of an unconditional
cash transfer program in Kenya found that an average transfer
of PPP US$720 led to positive impacts on consumption, food
security, assets, and psychological well-being. However, there
is suggestive evidence that the effects on consumption fell
by nearly half seven months after the program ended. The
evolution of impacts over a longer time horizon thus needs to
be further explored, both for cash transfer programs and for
programs like Graduation.

More research can help shed light on which components of
the Graduation program drive results. Since these evaluations
study a package of interventions, it is not possible to isolate
which components of the intervention drive results. Countryby-country variation reveals some preliminary indications. For
instance, in Ethiopia treatment and comparison households
both had access to consumption support through a food-forwork program. Treatment households in Ethiopia had some
of the largest effects of all countries relative to comparison
households, suggesting that consumption support alone
did not drive these results. Further evaluations that test the
effectiveness of individual components of the program, as
researchers are currently testing in the Ghana evaluation,
will help to disentangle which aspects of the intervention
are necessary to realize similar impacts.
