Foreword
Human progress in recent decades has been very uneven.
Alongside remarkable advances in life expectancy, literacy
and overall human well-being, there remain serious concerns and deprivation – persistent poverty, heightened
inequalities and greater vulnerability of many communities
and social groups in much of the world.
The United Nations summits of the 1990s, in particular the
1995 World Summit for Social Development, emphasized
the need to balance the economic and social objectives
of development. The Social Summit called for policy and
institutional changes to promote inclusive development
and, in the Copenhagen Declaration, Governments committed “to creating an economic, political, social, cultural
and legal environment that will enable people to achieve
social development”.
The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) also
expressed, in concrete terms, this renewed commitment to social development. And indeed, the goals have
been a highly effective tool to mobilize Governments and
other development actors, including the scientiﬁc and
research community.

UNRISD is well placed to have undertaken such a comprehensive inquiry. It has drawn on both its extensive network
of researchers from around the world and its autonomous
status within the United Nations system. This status allows
the Institute wide latitude to engage with sensitive issues,
question mainstream policies and institutional arrangements, and propose alternatives. Studies of this nature,
which can generate new policy options grounded in sound
empirical evidence, are essential if we are to accelerate
progress towards poverty reduction. On the eve of the
2010 review of the MDGs, I commend the ﬁndings to
policy makers and a wide global audience.

Combating Poverty and Inequality is an important contribution to efforts to systematically explain how poverty
reduction depends crucially on the interconnections
among economic development, social policy and politics.
The report reveals how poverty and inequality cannot be
addressed by narrow approaches to social protection, or
faith in the by-now-discredited notion that the beneﬁts of
economic growth will sufﬁciently trickle down to the poor.
The analysis points instead to the need for new directions
in macroeconomic policy and structural change to generate decent employment. It also stresses that processes of
policy and institutional change should be democratically
anchored and shaped by active citizenship.

Preface
Combating Poverty and Inequality is published just as global
leaders meet to review and recommit themselves to a set
of goals for reducing poverty agreed, under vastly different
circumstances, a decade ago. The optimism of the new millennium is now overshadowed by the effects of multiple,
interrelated crises. Progress in many areas appears threatened and resources are more constrained.
This volume provides a timely reminder of the strengths
and limitations of various approaches to addressing poverty
in the current context. It is the culmination of an ambitious project, Poverty Reduction and Policy Regimes, initiated
with characteristic foresight by my predecessor as Director of UNRISD, Thandika Mkandawire. Responding to a
concern that dominant approaches to poverty reduction,
as reﬂected for example in the PRSPs and MDGs, had
serious shortcomings, the research aimed to reposition
the analysis of poverty and poverty reduction processes
within the broader political economy of development.
A key premise of the report is that poverty cannot be
reduced when both analysis of the problem, and the people
affected, are relegated to the margins of development processes – targeted with safety nets or residual policy interventions while economic growth fails to create jobs, deliver
services, or provide other means through which all individuals can realize their capabilities.
Building on lessons from prior research on social policy
by UNRISD, the report demonstrates that countries which
have successfully reduced poverty, from Europe to East
Asia, did so through strategic state interventions. These
included transformative social policies that aimed not
only at protecting the vulnerable, but that also enhanced
productive capacities, provided critical social investments
and performed a redistributive function that contributed,
in turn, to social cohesion and nation building.

Critical to this process have been links forged between state
capacity, institutional arrangements and policies across the
spheres of politics, the economy and society. As we face an
increasingly complex global environment, where progress
in some areas is threatened by new sources of vulnerability
in others, solutions will equally need to reﬂect this complexity. The interrelationships between institutions of the state,
market and household, and between social and economic
policies, as well as relationships of politics and power, must
inform our policy responses. We hope that this volume illuminates some of the critical linkages as we continue to seek
effective interventions for combating poverty.
On behalf of UNRISD, I would like to thank the Swedish
International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)
and the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their generous and patient support for the research on which this report
is based, as well as the governments of Denmark, Finland,
Mexico, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and
the United Kingdom who have provided core funding to
UNRISD during the course of this work and without which
such endeavours would not be possible. Many researchers
around the world contributed to this report: we are grateful to them all. Yusuf Bangura, who has worked tirelessly
as project coordinator and lead author to see this project
through to completion, deserves particular recognition. I
would also like to express my personal gratitude and congratulations to all my colleagues at UNRISD: this has been an
Institute-wide effort, and a very long journey which I joined
only in its ﬁnal steps. We hope the results will contribute
to renewed commitments and improved policies to reverse
widening inequalities and end the unacceptable deprivation
which continues to afﬂict millions of people worldwide.

Neoliberal approaches to social protection fail to deliver on several counts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The beneﬁts of narrowly targeting social assistance are questionable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Universal social protection demands a strong state role . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Universal programmes offer greater beneﬁts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Universal social protection can enhance economic progress . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Where poverty is widespread, social protection programmes should promote sustainable livelihoods
and redistribution . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A rights-based approach to social protection should seek to limit conditionality and targeting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Social assistance should be complemented by policies that promote redistribution and decent work . . . . . . . . . . . . .

4. When Democracies Deliver Outcomes That Are Beneﬁcial to the Poor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In high-income democracies, organized interest groups spurred redistribution . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In welfare democracies in the South, subaltern groups were the main catalysts for change . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In dualist countries leaning towards welfare democracy, social pacts have been key . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Gains are possible, even if interest groups lack ties to power . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In countries with weak civil societies, electoral competition can bring leaders to account . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Overview
The global economic and food crises have called into question the possibility of achieving the Millennium Development Goals of halving poverty and hunger by 2015. Before
the crises, the number of poor people, deﬁned in the MDGs
as those living on less than $1.25 a day, had fallen: from
1.8 billion in 1990 to 1.4 billion in 20051 (see ﬁgure O.1).
Progress across regions was, however, varied with East Asia
experiencing the sharpest fall – thanks to China’s rapid
growth – and sub-Saharan Africa the least. Even if globally
the poverty rate is reduced by half by 2015, as the latest
United Nations progress report on the MDGs suggests,2
about one billion people will still be mired in extreme poverty by 2015. Furthermore, according to estimates of the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO), the number of malnourished individuals rose above
the one billion mark in 2009 for the ﬁrst time.3

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Income and wealth inequality have also increased in most
countries, as have inequalities based on gender, ethnicity
and region. In developing countries, children in the poorest
households and those in rural areas have a greater chance of
being underweight than children in the richest households
or those in cities and towns.4 In some of the least developed
countries, children in the poorest households are three times
less likely to attend primary school than those in the richest
households. And globally, girls account for a much higher
percentage of those who drop out of school than boys.
Persistent poverty in some regions, and growing inequalities worldwide, are stark reminders that economic globalization and liberalization have not created an environment
conducive to sustainable and equitable social development.
Even now, when poverty reduction is relatively high on the
international policy agenda and governments are launching direct assaults on poverty through various programmes,
poverty and inequality are proving intractable foes.

When a substantial proportion of a
country’s population is poor, it makes
little sense to detach poverty from the
dynamics of development
This report explores the causes, dynamics and persistence of
poverty; it examines what works and what has gone wrong
in international policy thinking and practice, and lays out
a range of policies and institutional measures that countries
can adopt to alleviate poverty. The report argues that current approaches to poverty often ignore its root causes, and
consequently do not follow through the causal sequence.
Rather, they focus on measuring things that people lack to
the detriment of understanding why they lack them.
The report analyses poverty reduction as part of long-term
processes of social, economic and political transformation,
but also draws important lessons from the experiences of
those countries that have successfully combined economic
development and active social policy to reduce poverty

2

over relatively short time periods. It is critical of current
approaches to poverty reduction that treat the poor as a
residual category requiring discrete policies. When a substantial proportion of a country’s population is poor, it makes
little sense to detach poverty from the dynamics of development. For countries that have been successful in increasing
the well-being of the majority of their populations, long-term
processes of structural transformation, not poverty reduction
per se, were central to public policy objectives.
The report also examines the complex ways that poverty alleviation outcomes are shaped by the interconnection of ideas,
institutions, policies and practices in a triad of economic
development, social policy and politics. It advocates a pattern of growth and structural change that can generate and
sustain jobs that are adequately remunerated and accessible
to all – regardless of income or class status, gender, ethnicity or location. It calls for comprehensive social policies that
are grounded in universal rights and that support structural
change, social cohesion and democratic politics. And it makes
the case for civic rights, activism and political arrangements
that ensure that states are responsive to the needs of citizens
and that the poor have inﬂuence in how policies are shaped.
Such an approach contrasts with contemporary efforts to
reduce poverty through discrete social policies that are often
weakly related to a country’s system of production or macroeconomic policies. This has been the case with three of the
dominant approaches to poverty reduction in the past decade,
including the IMF– and World Bank–led Poverty Reduction
Strategy Papers (PRSPs), the introduction in many countries of
targeted poverty reduction and social protection programmes,
and the UN–led Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
(see box O.1).
In the ﬁve years that remain of the MDG process, it is important that the world community continue to concentrate
on meeting the agreed-upon targets, drawing lessons from
recent experience about the most effective mechanisms for
doing so. It is equally important to begin an inquiry into
how to sustain progress towards equitable development and
poverty reduction in a post–MDG world. This report aims
to contribute to this endeavour.

OVERVIEW

BOX O.1: Contemporary approaches to poverty reduction
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers lay out the economic and social policies that governments in low-income countries should pursue
to achieve growth and reduce poverty. The PRSPs share a strong lineage with the structural adjustment policies of the 1980s, which
sought to correct the macroeconomic imbalances of crisis-affected countries. The deﬂationary and social consequences of these
policies galvanized the international community, in 1996, to launch the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, which
focuses on reducing countries’ debts while helping to spur growth and reduce poverty. Through this process, the PRSPs emerged as a
framework aimed at ensuring that resources freed up by debt relief would be used for poverty reduction. The IMF’s Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF), established in 1999, subsequently became the key instrument for providing loans. The PRGF was expected
to support the PRSP goals of growth, poverty reduction and country ownership. In practice, however, it has remained narrowly focused
on achieving ﬁscal stability.a Rather than being designed to support PRSPs, therefore, it often pre-determines the macroeconomic
frameworks and low inﬂation targets of the PRSPs. The resulting ﬁscal frameworks tend to be pro-poor in the sense that aid policy has
been reoriented towards basic services. However, they have failed to be pro-growth, especially in terms of infrastructure investment
and support for other growth-related activities that will expand capacity in agriculture and industry.b

Programmes that target the poor
In the 1980s, ﬁscal constraints, as well as criticism of the capture of resources by elites, forced many governments in developing
countries to shift priorities, placing less emphasis on the goal of universal social protection and more emphasis on targeting the poor.
Social programmes were often cut back to residual interventions to cushion the worst effects of adjustment measures, while narrowly
targeted mechanisms gained popularity on efﬁciency grounds. Since then social spending on health and education has often increased
but targeted approaches have remained. While there are many positive examples of initiatives that have reduced poverty, sustained
consumption and encouraged labour market participation, there are also shortcomings associated with this approach. Identifying and
reaching those most in need requires a degree of state administrative capacity that is often not present in low-income countries, or that
has been undermined in recent decades as a result of structural adjustment policies and public sector retrenchment. Where poverty
is widespread, targeting is unlikely to make signiﬁcant inroads. Moreover, targeted programmes that are not linked to a broader
strategy aimed at ensuring that all citizens have access to basic services and income or consumption guarantees may exacerbate
exclusion, resulting in lower quality services for the poor. Targeting also mitigates against the building of links among classes, groups
and generations that enhance social solidarity.

Millennium Development Goals
The MDGs are a clear demonstration that world leaders can come together to address the major challenges of our time – not only
war and ﬁnancial crisis, but also poverty. The MDGs acknowledge the multidimensional nature of poverty, going beyond simplistic
measures of income to identify other elements that deﬁne the experience of being poor. Leaving aside the improbability that people
in some parts of the world could even survive on $1.25 a day – the current deﬁnition of extreme poverty – such income metrics fail
to account for the vulnerabilities and indignities that plague the lives of many people in poor countries. Such concerns are reﬂected
in the inclusion in the MDGs of other targets, such as alleviating hunger, promoting universal primary education, reducing maternal
and child mortality, advancing gender equality and easing the burden of major diseases. Despite an ambitious agenda, the MDGs
nonetheless represent a cautious approach to social development. A number of critical issues and obstacles to overcoming poverty
have not been addressed, including the mechanisms required to achieve the goals individually, or the synergies among them; the role
of employment; growing levels of inequality; the often contradictory impact of certain macroeconomic policies; and the political and
social relations that structure power and exclusion.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Seven Arguments towards
the Reduction of Poverty and
Inequality
Poverty reduction requires growth and
structural change that generate productive
employment
A fundamental precondition for poverty reduction is a pattern of growth and structural change that generates productive employment, improves earnings and contributes to the
general welfare of the population. Employment represents a
crucial channel through which income derived from growth
can be widely shared. If people have adequately remunerated jobs, they can lift themselves out of poverty, participate
in social insurance schemes that enhance their well-being,
and improve their educational and health status. In short,
employment-centred growth can have a strong multiplier
effect on various MDG targets. However, growth in many
low-income countries has not been sustained and has failed
to deliver jobs. Labour is still moving out of agriculture.
But it tends to be absorbed into low-value activities in the
urban informal sector where prospects for improving productivity and incomes are limited.

Employment represents a crucial
channel through which income derived
from growth can be widely shared
Three issues undermine efforts to adopt growth strategies
that are employment centred. First, increased globalization
has weakened the organic links between agriculture and
industry. In many countries today, the urban population
is largely fed by importing food rather than by supporting
domestic agriculture; many countries also import most of
their manufactured goods rather than expanding domestic
production. In least developed countries with high levels
of poverty, both agriculture and industry have stagnated
because of this trend. Second, technological change and

4

sources of productivity growth are increasingly determined
by foreign ﬁrms, reducing the demand for labour. The third
issue relates to the continued hold of neoliberal ideas on
macroeconomic policies, which emphasize ﬁscal restraint,
privatization and liberalization. Within this framework,
employment is seen as a by-product of growth that does
not require direct policies. Even the macroeconomic
frameworks of the PRSPs, which are supposed to help lowincome countries generate growth and reduce poverty, are
constrained by standard structural adjustment programmes
that have been strongly criticized as deﬂationary.
Governments can achieve employment-centred structural
change by pursuing deliberate policies in a number areas.
These include:
• instituting selective and well-managed industrial
and agricultural policies that connect the agricultural
sector more productively to industry and other sectors
of the economy;
• stimulating and maintaining an adequate level of
labour demand by expanding domestic production and
raising the demand for domestic goods and services;
• investing in infrastructure as well as education,
training and research to improve skills, productivity
and the mobility of the population; and
• adopting a macroeconomic framework that avoids
procyclical policies or restrictive monetary and ﬁscal
policies during periods of slow growth.
In addition, the international community can
• provide support to the least developed countries
by reducing vulnerability to commodity price and
interest rate shocks, phasing out agricultural subsidies
in rich countries and granting more access to rich
country markets.

Comprehensive social policies are essential
for successful poverty reduction
Even when employment levels are high, social policies play an essential role in enabling people to extricate
themselves from poverty. A number of welfare policies are

OVERVIEW

feasible and affordable for countries at fairly low levels of
income. In fact, evidence from across the world, including
high-income countries, suggests that poverty levels are
drastically reduced after social transfers have been implemented, with the most signiﬁcant reductions occurring in
countries with comprehensive social policies that aim at
universal coverage.

services and the funding of complementary social assistance programmes out of public revenues. Social polices
must also acknowledge and reward the unpaid care work
that goes into sustaining families, households and societies
by investing in social infrastructure and basic services, and
reducing the workload of women.

Although the MDGs are fundamentally about the promotion of social development, they do not provide a social
policy framework for achieving the targets and exploiting
the synergies among them. In efforts to meet the MDG targets, many countries, sometimes with the support of donors,
have introduced targeted social assistance programmes. In
countries where such programmes are well funded and stable, and reach large numbers of people, the results have
been positive. However, where poverty and deprivation are
widespread, targeting is unlikely to make signiﬁcant and
sustained inroads into poverty, may fail to build support
among middle-income groups that are needed for funding
and providing good quality services, and may condemn the
poor to inadequate services.

Social policy, at its best,
is transformative, and cannot be
separated from efforts to create
employment-centred growth and
structural change

An effective social policy framework for rapid and sustained
poverty reduction must be grounded in universal rights.
It should aim to:
• reinforce the redistributive effects of economic policy;
• protect people from income loss and costs associated
with unemployment, pregnancy, sickness, chronic
illness or disability, and old age;
• enhance the productive capacities of individuals,
groups and communities; and
• reduce the burden of the growth and reproduction of
society, including care-related work, which is unfairly
borne by women.
This suggests that social policy, at its best, is transformative,
and cannot be separated from efforts to create employmentcentred growth and structural change since they allow for
the incorporation of more people into social insurance
schemes that are redistributive across classes, groups and
generations. Employment-centred growth and structural
change also facilitate the provision of universal social

High levels of inequality are an obstacle
to poverty reduction
The PRSPs and MDGs are concerned primarily with absolute levels of poverty; neither directly addresses the issue of
inequality.5 In contexts of high inequality, growth is often
concentrated among sectors that beneﬁt the elite; the poor,
on the other hand, are likely to be excluded from market opportunities or to lack the resources to beneﬁt from
growth. High levels of inequality make it harder to reduce
poverty even when economies are growing, while the evidence also reveals that poor countries are generally more
unequal than rich ones. Poverty and inequality must thus
be considered as interconnected parts of the same problem.
Poverty is closely related to various dimensions of inequality, including income status, gender, ethnicity and location.
And inequalities are manifest across several dimensions,
such as employment, earnings and access to social services.
These inequalities are often interlocking and dysfunctional
for development for a number of reasons.

Poverty and inequality must be
considered as interconnected parts
of the same problem

5

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

First, they make it harder to incorporate the poor and disadvantaged in the growth process; inequalities constrain
their productive capacity and their potential contribution
to development. Second, in highly unequal societies, the
poor are more likely to be locked into a subsistence economy. This may limit the size of the domestic market and
thus retard the potential for sustained growth. Third, high
levels of interlocking inequalities may undermine the realization of civil, political and social rights; they may raise the
level of crime and plunge societies into conﬂict. Fourth,
high levels of inequality may create institutions that maintain the political, economic and social privileges of the
elite and lock the poor into poverty traps from which it is
difﬁcult to escape.
Countries can adopt a number of redistributive policies
to tackle the multiple dimensions of inequality. These
include:
• providing the poor (differentiated by gender, ethnicity
and other relevant characteristics) with greater access
to productive assets, such as land;
• investing in social infrastructure to reduce the drudgery
of domestic work;
• pursuing afﬁrmative action policies for disadvantaged
groups within a framework that incorporates all citizens
in national development and welfare provision;
• stimulating investment in rural infrastructure,
creating public works programmes and increasing
access to credit;
• pursuing ﬁscal reforms that improve tax administration,
prevent tax evasion, and limit opposition to progressive
taxation and redistribution; and
• creating a stable global economic environment that
responds to the needs of low-income countries.

maintained competent bureaucracies. Such effective states
must be able to overcome critical market failures, assist in
the acquisition of new technologies, mobilize and channel
resources to productive sectors, enforce standards and regulations, establish social pacts, and fund and manage services
and social programmes.

Countries that have successfully
reduced poverty had purposeful,
growth-oriented and welfare-enhancing
political systems; they also built and
maintained competent bureaucracies

Building state capacity requires a focus on three crucial
dimensions:
• the crafting of political coalitions needed to set and
carry out policy;
• mobilizing resources with which to implement
development objectives; and
• allocating resources to productive and welfare-enhancing
sectors and enforcing rules governing their use.
Building political coalitions and strengthening resource
mobilization capacities can improve policy space and are
likely to be effective when governments embrace agendas that provide wide-ranging and good quality services
to broad sections of the population. And enforcement
capacity can be enhanced when citizens participate in
monitoring resource use. States with a broad power base,
well-organized ruling parties, competent bureaucracies and
an activist citizenry have effectively implemented redistributive policies and tackled poverty.

Poverty reduction requires effective state action
Sustained progress in combating poverty requires effective states that are both developmental and redistributive.
Countries that have successfully reduced poverty in relatively short periods of time had purposeful, growth-oriented
and welfare-enhancing political systems; they also built and

6

Current approaches to state-building have focused largely
on market-enhancing reforms of good governance,
managerialism and decentralization. Aspects of these
reforms are desirable goals for all countries, but they do
not necessarily generate and sustain growth or produce
socially equitable outcomes.

OVERVIEW

Politics matters for poverty reduction
The protection of civic rights, active and organized citizens,
and political parties that effectively engage the poor and
other disadvantaged groups are all important for sustained
progress towards poverty reduction. Most low-income
countries have relied on the participatory frameworks of
PRSPs to involve citizens in designing and implementing anti-poverty strategies. However, the consultative
process adopted has generally failed to give citizen groups
the power to effect real change or to get policy makers to
deliver on agreed-upon goals. Many such groups typically
feel that real decisions on important policies lie elsewhere.
Similarly, current international efforts to involve big business in poverty reduction through corporate social responsibility, private regulation and stakeholder dialogue have
largely failed to take account of how, historically, business
collaborated with states and social groups in societies that
have alleviated poverty.

The protection of civic rights, active
and organized citizens, and political
parties that effectively engage the poor
are all important for poverty reduction
Lessons from successful democracies suggest that effective
strategies to combat poverty require that:
• rights be institutionalized to allow citizens to organize
and contest public policies as autonomous actors;
• political parties are embedded within broad social
coalitions that include the active participation of the
poor, women and other disadvantaged groups;
• bargaining regimes or social pacts are constructed that
give groups voice and inﬂuence in holding corporations
and states to account and in shaping development
policies and outcomes; and
• the democratic regime is sufﬁciently competitive to
create uncertainties in electoral outcomes, allow for
periodic changes in power and prevent ruling parties
from becoming complacent.

There are many paths
to poverty reduction
Different countries have pursued divergent paths to achieve
development. Most countries that have been successful in
exploiting the beneﬁts of globalization have adopted heterodox policies that reﬂected their national conditions,
rather than fully embracing market-conforming prescriptions. Evidence from such countries suggests that industrialization provides a powerful pathway to improved incomes
and well-being. However, industrialization is not the only
viable route out of poverty. If governments in low-income
agrarian societies commit to supporting agriculture by
improving productive capacities, incomes and services in
rural areas, agriculture can provide a solid foundation for
development and for enabling low-income households to
move out of poverty.
The global economic crisis has given added impetus
to the calls from developing countries for greater policy
space. This is a potentially important development, but it
should not be reduced to issues such as less donor conditionality or the possibility of developing country governments adopting countercyclical policies. Policy space also
means that countries and peoples should have the option
to adopt different models of development in which issues
of employment-centred growth and structural change,
transformative social policy, and democratic politics
that elevate the interests of the poor in policy making,
ﬁgure prominently.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Poverty is reduced when economic and
social policies, institutions and political
arrangements are mutually supportive
Rapid and sustained progress towards poverty reduction
requires recognition of, and action on, the interconnectedness
of different policies and institutions. Reducing poverty entails
not only having employment-centred growth strategies, or
pursuing comprehensive social policies, or even getting the
politics right. It is also about consciously coordinating policies
and institutions in those three domains to deliver maximum
impact. Governments should focus on the way institutions
and policies are linked across spheres and the synergies they
create in tackling speciﬁc problems. Effectiveness of one institution or policy in a particular sphere may lead to, or require,
complementary institutions or policies in others.

The exploitation of synergies requires
conscious design of both economic and
social policies, backed by sufﬁciently
powerful coalitions to see them through
Pursuit of one set of policies in one domain and the neglect
of others may undermine the full realization of the beneﬁts
of the chosen set of policies. For instance, if countries pursue only employment-centred growth, segments of the population that are disadvantaged or excluded from the labour
market may be negatively affected. Similarly, if social policy
is detached from the dynamics of production, the resources
required to support social policy may not be generated, and
economies may experience crisis or inﬂation if social programmes are expanded, ultimately worsening the position
of the poor. Also, strategies that succeed in mobilizing citizens but fail to expand productive capacities and opportunities may produce politically unstable outcomes.
Achieving institutional complementarity requires – but
should not be reduced to – policy coherence. Institutional
complementarities or policy regimes are a product of competing values on rights, differences in the weights accorded

8

to markets and non-market institutions in coordinating
activities, and differences in power structures that have
evolved historically. The exploitation of synergies among
different sectors and subsectors is important in overcoming
poverty and inequality. However, such synergistic relationships are not automatic. They require conscious design of
both economic and social policies, backed by sufﬁciently
powerful coalitions to see them through.

Summary of the Report
This report is grounded in extensive research on contemporary
and historical approaches to poverty reduction and draws out
important insights and implications for policy. It is based on
research by the United Nations Research Institute for Social
Development (UNRISD) that includes more than 40 background papers, as well as in-depth case studies and overview
papers of countries or territories with different development
experiences (see box O.2). It explains why some countries
have been more successful than others in combating poverty,
and how economic and social policies, and politics, can be
organized to produce good anti-poverty outcomes.
Section one of the report analyses the dynamics of structural
change in diverse country, economic and social contexts. It
advocates a pattern of growth and structural change that
can create and sustain decent jobs that are accessible to all
regardless of income status, gender, ethnicity or location.
Section two examines the central role of social policy in
combating poverty and inequality. It advocates a universal
approach to social protection, along with selective interventions to reach the most excluded groups; universal
provision of social services, including care; and ﬁnancing
mechanisms that are redistributive and sustainable in economic and political terms.
Section three discusses the importance of effective state
action and types of business practices and democratic
politics that are conducive to poverty reduction.

OVERVIEW

BOX O.2: Preparing this report: A note on case studies and approaches to poverty
As inputs to this report, UNRISD commissioned in-depth studies on Botswana, Brazil, Costa Rica, India, Kenya, Malaysia, South Africa
and Taiwan Province of China. These were classiﬁed according to regime characteristics of democracy and authoritarianism and ﬁve
patterns of structural change:
• economies that have made successful transitions to manufacturing;
• cases of high levels of industrialization with dualist labour markets;
• cases of service-led growth;
• economies in which agriculture dominates; and
• mineral-rich economies.
The research focused on six broad themes:
• development strategies, structural change and poverty reduction;
• wealth and income inequality;
• social protection;
• social services;
• organized interests, development strategies and social policy; and
• developmental state capacity.
In addition, overview papers addressing similar issues were commissioned on China, Finland, Ireland, the Republic of Korea,
Singapore, the former Soviet Union, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam, representing:
• late industrializers with high levels of structural change;
• countries with a good record in poverty reduction that have pursued heterodox economic policies in opening up to the world market;
• countries that historically have done well in human development with low per capita incomes; and
• countries with a previously good record in poverty reduction and that have transitioned from communism to capitalism.
Many of these cases appear repeatedly in various chapters of the report and are used to shed light on the links between structural
change, social policy and politics. UNRISD also commissioned more than 40 background papers to complement the ﬁndings of the
case studies. Apart from their rich insights on certain themes that are relevant to the report, some of these papers also yielded
detailed information on an additional set of countries: Argentina, Cambodia, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Indonesia, Mexico and Senegal.
The report also draws substantially on previous work by UNRISD. The case studies used national poverty lines rather than $1.25 a
day measures.a Although this makes comparisons of the incidence of poverty across cases difﬁcult, it throws light on the dynamics
of poverty in different contexts. No income metric can account for the complex of deprivations that exists in poor countries, which
underscores the importance of studying poverty from a multidimensional perspective. However, in order to highlight the centrality of
employment in poverty reduction and the nature of poverty risks for different types of sectors and social groups, some of the chapters
of the report focus on income poverty. The limitations of income measures of poverty have been highlighted by many scholars.b For
instance, fast-growing India has done well in income-poverty reduction but has experienced regression or slow progress in other
dimensions of poverty, such as infant mortality and child nutrition. The report, therefore, addresses multiple aspects of well-being,
such as educational achievements, life expectancy and nutrition, which are identiﬁed in the capability approach, which focuses on
the type of life individuals can live rather than their income. Such an approach draws attention to the importance of social rights and
freedoms, a theme that runs throughout the report. That said, the capability approach also shares a common feature with the income
approach in that it fails to pay adequate attention to group dynamics and the causes of poverty.c The approach to poverty used in this
report is rooted in power relations, global dynamics and group analysis. It seeks to explain why people are poor and why inequalities
exist, as well as what can be done to rectify these injustices.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Section One: Socially Inclusive
Structural Change
Structural change involves continuous shifts in the shares
of manufacturing, services and agriculture in output and
employment in favour of more dynamic sectors. How
these sectors are organized, and how individuals, groups
and communities are integrated into them, have implications for people’s livelihoods. Employment represents the
single most important source of income for the majority
of the world’s people – either directly through their participation in the labour market, or indirectly through their
membership in households sustained by earnings from
employment. Structural change that improves employment
opportunities will therefore be more inclusive than that in
which the quality of employment stagnates or deteriorates.
Conversely, unequal access to decent work and persistent
labour market inequalities will frustrate efforts to reduce
poverty. Labour market inequalities manifest themselves
in relation to class, gender and ethnicity, and may take
the form of casual, irregular and unprotected employment,
longer working hours and low pay. They are also linked to
other dimensions of inequality, such as asset holdings and
access to services, social protection schemes and political
power. Strategies for socially inclusive structural change
should therefore be based on employment-centred growth
and redistributive policies that address multiple inequalities of class, gender and ethnicity.

Generating employment should be a central
objective of structural change
Chapter 1 outlines elements of a framework for incorporating employment more centrally in development policy. It
highlights the potential and limits of different growth paths
in generating employment and points to the importance of
national policy space in formulating employment-centred
development strategies. It argues that economic growth or
industrialization per se will not necessarily lead to sustained
improvements in employment, income and well-being.
The traditional rich-country pattern of structural change,

in which economic growth fuelled a shift from agriculture
to industry and from industry to services, as well as a shift
from informal sector to formal wage employment, is difﬁcult to replicate in the context of open economies without
deliberate policies. Workers are still moving out of agriculture in the vast majority of countries. But they typically ﬁnd
work in low-value services and informal employment with
limited opportunities for sustained growth in productivity
and incomes. The free-market orientation of development
policy in the last few decades has made matters worse, since,
in many countries, it has been associated with expanding
labour market inequalities, persistent informalization and
the emergence of precarious forms of employment.

Economic growth or industrialization
per se will not necessarily lead
to sustained improvements in
employment, income and well-being

The chapter shows that structural change can have multiple trajectories, such as situations of stalled industrialization and dualistic labour markets (that is, a formal sector
that offers high wages, beneﬁts, security and prospects for
upward mobility; and an informal sector characterized by
low incomes and less job security, training and mobility), as
found in many Latin American and other middle-income
countries. Other countries have experienced service-led
growth paths or have economies in which agriculture still
dominates. In still other countries, the course of structural
change is determined by mineral wealth. The chapter discusses the extent to which these different patterns of structural change are socially inclusive in terms of their capacity
to generate jobs and improve incomes and well-being. It
shows that growth paths that are driven by low-productivity activities in agriculture and services, or by mineral
rents in which structural change is stuck in the primary sector, have produced highly segmented and unequal labour
markets. In these types of economies, the poor are often

OVERVIEW

locked out of dynamic growth sectors. Poverty may take the
form of persistent unemployment; part-time work with low
remuneration and protection; longer working hours at low
pay; or widespread underemployment and low incomes in
informal and agricultural activities.
The structure of households – that is, the composition of
earners and dependents – directly inﬂuences how employment opportunities translate into changes in poverty outcomes. The report employs a working poor poverty rate to
examine the relationship among different types of employment and poverty outcomes. The working poor are deﬁned
as individuals who are employed and living in households
whose income or consumption levels fall below a poverty
threshold. The working poor poverty rate is the number of
working poor in a particular employment category expressed
as a percentage of the total number of people in the same
employment category. Working poor poverty rates tend to
be higher in agricultural versus non-agricultural employment and in informal versus formal employment.
The report argues that policy is crucial for generating structural change that realizes better quality employment and
poverty outcomes. However, there is no one-size-ﬁts-all
approach to employment policy; and the critical institutions for inclusive outcomes often lie outside the labour
market itself. Macroeconomic policy, ﬁnancial institutions,
the international structure of production, the nature and
composition of households, gender dynamics and social
policy all inﬂuence employment outcomes and the potential for better opportunities to translate into real differences
in people’s lives. Countries that seek to expand employment
opportunities must adopt macroeconomic frameworks that
avoid restrictive monetary and ﬁscal policies during periods of poor growth since they tend to reduce the growth of
domestic demand, which affects employment generation.6
Countries that have been successful in reducing poverty
relatively quickly used industrial and agricultural policies to
facilitate employment-centred structural transformations.
The precise policy conﬁguration differs across countries,
but they share a number of common features, including:
• public investment in infrastructure;

• development ﬁnance to channel credit to speciﬁc
productive activities;
• well-managed industrial and agricultural policies
such as subsidies, tax credits, extension services and
land redistribution;
• management of the investment-export nexus;
• the pursuit of dynamic competitive advantage by
nurturing the development of strategic industries and
activities; and
• social policies that improved the skill levels and welfare
of the population.
Similar kinds of interventions can be used in many countries today that have the governance capacity to transform
the structure of employment, nurture productive linkages
between industry and agriculture, and encourage the development of a solid foundation of decent work opportunities.
Such strategies will have to be sensitive to the constraints
of climate change, which require additional efforts to support technological capacities that will propel countries
onto high-growth paths that are low carbon-intensive.7

Reducing income inequality is
essential for poverty reduction
Inequality is considered by some to be of little social concern. So long as poverty is minimized, it is argued, there
should be no principled objection to the unbridled gains of
the very rich. In some hands, this argument becomes one of
active advocacy: that the concentration of wealth should
be cultivated to generate savings, investment and growth.8
Yet the fact that high levels of inequality are often found
in the poorest countries exposes the weakness of this argument. Evidence suggests, in fact, a two-way causal relationship between poverty and inequality. But there are other
grounds on which concern about inequality is warranted.
The international human rights framework commits
governments to uphold equality in civil and political
rights and to take steps progressively to achieve this.
Furthermore, some notion of equity is central to the
construction of inclusive societies and the realization of
substantive citizenship.9

11

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Evidence suggests a two-way
causal relationship between poverty
and inequality
Apart from a commitment to eliminate gender disparities
in primary and secondary education, the MDGs virtually
ignore the issue of inequality. Recent reports10 have underscored the intrinsic value of equality as well as its relevance
for achieving growth and reducing poverty. But the view
articulated in the World Bank’s World Development Report
2006, for example, emphasizes equality of opportunities
as opposed to outcomes. This argument justiﬁes unequal
outcomes if the processes that generate them are fair,11
and advocates interventions only to protect those who
fall below an absolute threshold of need. The result is a
weak redistributive agenda that shies away from any serious consideration of wealth and income redistribution now,
emphasizing instead investments in opportunities that
might produce a more equitable future.12
Chapter 2 examines the causes, patterns and dynamics
of inequality, with a particular focus on inequalities of
income and wealth, often referred to as vertical inequalities. Emphasis is placed on both the intrinsic and instrumental value of redistributive policies and processes that
lead to equitable outcomes. The chapter demonstrates that
increases in inequality are linked to a range of economic
policies that have dominated the development agenda
in recent decades. These include ﬁnancial liberalization,
regressive taxation, privatization in the context of weak
regulation, public expenditure policies that fail to protect
the poor during crisis or adjustment periods, and labour
market policies that lead to precarious forms of ﬂexibility, informalization and an erosion of minimum wages and
union bargaining power.13
Despite the importance of structural change in determining
levels of inequality, there is no single pattern that holds for
all countries across time. Instead, (i) redistributive policies
can moderate inequalities even at early stages of industrialization, and (ii) rapidly industrializing economies with a

12

previously egalitarian income distribution may experience
rising inequalities in the absence of corrective measures.
Furthermore, (iii) most low-income agrarian societies that
have not yet experienced sustained growth and industrialization, and whose public policies lack a redistributive focus,
generally have high levels of inequality, and (iv) the growing dominance of the ﬁnancial and technological sectors in
national economies, especially in contexts where economic
policies favour market liberalization and less redistribution,
increases inequality.
The chapter also shows that structural change – in terms
of the changing roles of agriculture, industry, technology
and ﬁnance in an economy – and the global terms of trade
among these sectors are closely related. In the short run,
global terms of trade have a direct effect on inequality
in a liberalized economy. For instance, a fall in global
commodity prices will tend to drive up inequality in agrarian economies by lowering the relative incomes of commodity producers. A technology bubble raises incomes
at the top. High interest rates, in general, penalize debtors and reward creditors; they thus raise inequality since
the latter are almost invariably richer than the former.
This underscores the importance of global governance of
ﬁnancial and commodity markets and the management of
global monetary policy.
Since reducing inequality has value in its own right, and
also yields substantial beneﬁts in terms of both poverty
reduction and growth, the chapter suggests a number of
mutually supportive redistributive policies that countries
can adopt. They include:
• land reform, especially in highly unequal economies
where the poor depend substantially on land for their
livelihoods;
• ﬁscal reforms that improve tax administration, prevent
tax evasion and avoidance, and limit opposition to
progressive taxation and redistribution;
• income-generating employment opportunities; and
• a number of expenditure-related policies that
will enhance the welfare of the poor (such as
the range of social policies discussed in Section two
of this report).

OVERVIEW

Redistributive policies can help mitigate ethnic
and regional inequalities
Structural change affects individuals, groups and regions
differently. Group membership is intrinsic to human development, and when the beneﬁts and costs of structural
change correspond to ethnic or religious afﬁnities, or geographic location, individuals may perceive development in
terms of those cleavages. Such inequalities may be a source
of conﬂict and adversely affect well-being. However, measures of inequality that rank individuals and households by
income often exclude group and spatial dimensions.
Group inequalities are closely linked to the ways in which
groups are integrated into different sectors of the economy,
as well as in their representation in political and social
institutions. They are also reﬂected in how identities are
valued in the cultural sphere. Such inequalities are therefore multidimensional and encompass economic, social,
cultural and political aspects. Achieving equality in each
of these dimensions has intrinsic value, as well as being
instrumental in promoting equality along other dimensions, or in achieving other development goals.
Chapter 3 analyses the evolution of inequalities among
different regions and ethnic groups as well as policies
for their mitigation. It highlights a number of reasons
why ethnic and spatial inequalities are critical in understanding poverty.
• First, between-group (or horizontal) inequalities make
up a large component of overall inequality within
any country. A focus on only vertical inequality may
obscure important differences among groups or regions.
Some groups may be seriously disadvantaged or have
higher than average concentrations of poverty even
when overall vertical inequality is low.
• Second, regional inequality in large industrializing
countries as well as in most developing and transition
economies appears to be on the rise. If ethnic groups
are geographically clustered, industrialization or
development may bypass groups that are not located
in economically dynamic zones, intensifying poverty
in neglected areas.

• Third, inequalities between ethnic groups can lead to
conﬂict, which may affect development. Indeed, most
conﬂicts today tend to have an ethnic dimension14 and
are difﬁcult to resolve.
• Fourth, horizontal or between-group inequalities are
signiﬁcant because, in some situations, it may not be
possible to improve the position of individuals without
tackling the position of the group.

Ethnic and spatial inequalities are
critical in understanding poverty
In ethnically diverse societies, regional and ethnic inequalities may be closely interrelated, although the dynamics
may differ when ethnic populations are highly mobile or
dispersed. Typically, regional inequalities increase in early
stages of development and decrease in more mature stages.
However, it is hard to predict how ethnic inequalities will
change over time as incomes increase. Ethnic inequalities
are often created by a foundational shock that may propel
a country along a particular development trajectory. Once
that shock has ended, those inequalities often persist for
long periods, and individuals may become mired in poverty because of the difﬁculties of moving across groups.
Groups that start out in a privileged position may forge
ahead, while those that have been underprivileged historically may be trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty. Breaking
through these cycles is crucial to tackling poverty levels
among disadvantaged groups.
The chapter argues that redistributive policies can help to
mitigate ethnic and spatial inequalities. It is easier to correct ethnic inequalities when an economy is growing, the
targeted population has strong links with policy-making
institutions, and the redistributive policy is part of a larger
strategy to transform the economy and eliminate poverty irrespective of ethnicity. Afﬁrmative action policies
that target disadvantaged groups may improve horizontal
inequalities but worsen intra-group and (overall) vertical
inequalities. Policies that target both ends of the distribution curve may lead to improvements in both inter- and

13

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

intra-group income distribution; those that focus on the
upper end of the curve may lead to a worsening of intragroup inequality. Regional disparities appear to respond well
to regional development strategies. Even poor countries
that have pursued such strategies have reduced poverty in
the worst-off areas. Correcting horizontal inequalities is
inherently political. Without political inclusivity, there is
little chance of implementing effective remedial policies
for disadvantaged groups.

Reducing gender inequalities requires both
redistributive and regulatory measures
Over the past two to three decades there have been signiﬁcant changes, many of them positive, in the social
and economic status of women that have helped reduce
gender inequalities. Such changes in women’s lives are
associated with the social transformations that attend economic development. But they are not simply a by-product
of economic growth. In many instances, change has been
instigated or accelerated by state reforms and social movements. The last decade of the twentieth century was particularly signiﬁcant, since it was marked by a series of political
transformations that included the transition from authoritarian rule in many parts of the world. Women’s movements, both national and transnational, took advantage
of the altered political context (that they themselves had
helped to shape) to advance women’s rights, working both
in and outside state machineries for legislative and policy
reforms. However, the positive outcomes of the past decade – in terms of girls’ enrolment in primary and secondary
education, women’s representation in politics and new legislation prohibiting violence and discrimination – must be
qualiﬁed in the light of continuing gender inequalities and
a less than favourable economic environment.
The ambivalent nature of women’s achievements is illustrated most strikingly in what has been termed the feminization of labour. As chapter 4 shows, not only has women’s
access to paid work increased in most countries (with the
exception of Eastern Europe and Central Asia) but, at the
same time, a deterioration has occurred in the terms and

14

conditions of much of the work on offer. Informal employment tends to be a greater source of employment for women
than for men in most developing regions, with women often
concentrated in the most casual and exploitative forms of
work. In some contexts, earnings are so low that even the
existence of multiple earners is not sufﬁcient to pull the
household above the poverty line.

Positive changes in the social and
economic status of women have
helped reduce gender inequalities,
but they are not simply a by-product
of economic growth
Given these realities, many have argued that poverty has
a female face or is increasingly feminized. The chapter
shows a more complicated picture. While labour market
segmentation by gender is pervasive, with women often
clustered into the more casual and low-paid segments of
the informal economy, this is not always reﬂected in poverty outcomes. Such outcomes, measured at the household
level, depend not only on women’s individual earnings
but also on the structure of their households and the
possibilities it presents for pooling household income.
The chapter argues that current measurement methods
can easily hide gender inequalities in access to income and
economic security. A household is considered poor if the
joint income of all members falls below a given poverty
threshold, assuming that household income is equitably
divided among all household members. Even where this
highly problematic assumption holds true and adult women
are able to escape material poverty by pooling income with
other household members, this can leave them in a situation of ﬁnancial dependence.
Reducing gender inequalities requires both redistributive and regulatory measures. Socially inclusive structural
change, for instance, requires a strengthening of women’s
links to the formal labour market as well as stronger regulation and protection of informal workers, among whom

OVERVIEW

women are overrepresented in many countries. The chapter discusses cases in which the extension of labour law,
social protections and regulations is already taking place,
especially in relation to domestic work, and where it has
improved wages and working conditions without adverse
consequences for employment. Though women are frequently excluded from social insurance programmes as
workers in their own right, they are being targeted by
many new social assistance programmes, often because of
their role as mothers. However, cash transfers are unlikely
to resolve the problem of gendered poverty and inequality unless they are underpinned by policies that promote
women’s access to long-term economic security. Reducing
and redistributing the amount of unpaid care work that
women and girls undertake to meet their social obligations
is essential to achieving these goals.

Section Two: Transformative Social
Policy and Poverty Reduction
Social policy can contribute to economic growth as well as
social welfare. It is an integral part of the growth strategies
of countries that have experienced far-reaching structural
change and reduced poverty rapidly. As late industrializers, these still developing countries adopted a number of
welfare policies at fairly low levels of income that covered
a substantial share of their populations. This contradicts
a conventional “stages” view of social policy and development, which posits that speciﬁc policies may be structurally
impossible or premature to adopt at certain levels of income.
The empirical evidence used to support this view includes
the fact that social expenditures are highly correlated to
levels of economic development and that, in rich countries,
the sequence of rights secured followed a certain pattern –
civil rights, political rights and then social rights. In contrast, the report argues that, although structural constraints
matter, there are no prerequisites for social and economic
policies that seek to eradicate poverty. Nor are there stages
of development through which countries must inevitably pass when introducing various aspects of social policy.

Latecomers can exploit the advantages of catching up by
absorbing lessons from the pioneering countries. This allows
for leap-frogging.
The experience of successful countries offers a crucial lesson
about the transformative role of social policy.15 For social policy to be transformative, it must not be conﬁned to a residual
role of providing only a safety net for the poor. Rather, it
must address broader economic, social and political goals,
such as distribution, protection, production and reproduction, which are consciously coordinated to deliver maximum
impact.16 If not, pursuit of one goal and neglect of the others may undermine the full realization of the beneﬁts of the
chosen goal. For instance, if countries pursue only redistribution and neglect the productive side of social policy, they
may plunge their economies into crisis, generate high levels
of inﬂation and ultimately worsen the position of the poor.
Similarly, if social policy is made too production-focused, segments of the population that are disadvantaged or excluded
from the labour market may be negatively affected. And if
social policy neglects the reproductive side, the burden of
growth and reproduction of society may be unfairly borne
by women, which may ultimately strain the social fabric and
reduce fertility rates to below replacement level.
This underscores the need to uphold both the intrinsic and
instrumental values of social policy. For instance, savings
accumulated as social insurance funds, such as pensions or
provident funds, can contribute to infrastructure development and industrialization. Similarly, investment in human
capital will not only improve the education and health of the
population, it will also raise the productivity of labour and
help ﬁrms and employees to manage adjustments in labour
markets during economic downturns. Social policies may
also act as powerful stabilizers, since income-replacement
schemes may help smooth economic cycles and avoid deﬂationary crises by stabilizing demand and domestic markets.
Social policy can also legitimize the political order, enhance
social cohesion and contribute to political stability.
Typically, a fall in poverty has had less to do with policies
aimed at poverty per se than those aimed at much wider
social objectives. Indeed, in a number of countries that have

15

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

successfully dealt with poverty, its alleviation was just one of
several goals prompting the introduction of social policies. In
the Nordic and East Asian countries, for example, broader
social objectives – including catching up, equality, full
employment, solidarity and nation building – had far-reaching
implications for poverty. And in more recent years, signiﬁcant
declines in poverty have taken place in some countries before
clear shifts towards more focused poverty reduction strategies. In fact, some have argued that the narrow preoccupation
with poverty may actually work against the broad and longterm efforts that are required to eradicate poverty.17 A UNDP
report on China points in the same direction (see box O.3).
The idea is not to dethrone poverty from the policy agenda,
but to stress that the factors that may eventually reduce poverty are not those that address its proximate causes.
BOX O.3: Poverty reduction in China:
Getting the policies right
“The poverty incidence [in China] fell most rapidly before

The report makes a strong case for the progressive realization of universal social rights that are grounded in a social
contract when poor countries address issues related to poverty. When poverty is widespread, targeting the underserved
is unnecessary and administratively costly. Targeting is also
fraught with problems such as asymmetries in information,
distortion of incentives and moral hazard. In addition, the
process of identifying the poor and underserved may lead
to discretion and arbitrariness, and subject targeted individuals to stigmatization and invasive processes. Thus the
universalism that guided social policy in many countries in
the past was in fact dictated by underdevelopment – targeting was simply too demanding in terms of available skills,
information and administrative capacity.18 Targeted policies may be necessary when background conditions make
it difﬁcult for segments of poor populations or other disadvantaged groups to access universal programmes. However, targeting can be most effective when pursued within a
larger framework that leans towards universalism.

reversal. This is not because China’s poverty reduction
policies and programs have been useless or counterproductive; on the contrary, there is reason to believe they
have made a difference in the localities where they were
carried out. Rather, it is because much larger forces have
determined the shape and speed of poverty reduction,
namely, macroeconomic and other general economic policies
and trends. These include, inter alia, policies concerning
farm prices, factor prices, state investments, ﬁscal structure,
ﬁnancial reform and the social safety net and social insurance

Protecting individuals and households during periods
when they cannot engage in gainful employment or obtain
enough income to secure their livelihoods – due to unemployment, sickness, chronic ill health or disability, old age
or care responsibilities, for example – is a key development
goal. However, the majority of the world’s people still lack
adequate access to basic social protection. Instead, they
provide for themselves or rely on the support of families,
communities or non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

regimes. When the constellation of such policies was strongly
pro-poor, poverty reduction occurred at a breathtaking speed,
despite the absence of explicit poverty reduction institutions.
Yet when the general policy constellation was not pro-poor,
then the course of poverty reduction was much less rapid.
A key conclusion from a review of this history is that there
are many ways in which China’s macroeconomic policies and
economic institutional set-up could be made more pro-poor
than they have generally been.”

Chapter 5 argues that there are good reasons, from both
normative and instrumental perspectives, to invest in public social protection policies in developing countries. Social
protection programmes not only provide access to income
and social services throughout the lifecycle and in times of
economic transition or crisis; they also reduce income and
human poverty in its various dimensions by contributing
to development and achieving more equal and socially
inclusive societies. Social protection is particularly beneﬁcial in the context of late development, since it affects

OVERVIEW

productivity as well as economic and political stability in
a positive way by cushioning the adverse social effects of
rapid structural change. The chapter advocates a universal and rights-based approach to social protection, which
fosters solidarity, social cohesion and coalition building
among classes, groups and generations.

A universal and rights-based approach
to social protection fosters solidarity,
social cohesion and coalition building
among classes, groups and generations
An analysis of experiences and developments in social protection across a number of countries suggests that no single approach predominates. Rather, the extension of social
insurance and social assistance follows a range of pathways
in different countries and regions, depending on policy
choices as well as the nature of existing institutions, level
of economic development, and features of their social and
economic transformation. However, market-oriented structural reforms that have been implemented during recent
decades and have aimed at privatization, decentralization
and the targeting of social protection programmes have not
yielded the expected results. In fact, they have produced a
number of adverse effects, such as declining coverage, lack
of horizontal and vertical redistribution, higher exposure to
market risks and high costs. Countries that have successfully
reduced income poverty and improved social conditions on
a broad scale have developed comprehensive social protection policies that are grounded in claimable entitlements
(derived from rights or contribution payments) covering a
majority of the population.
More recent trends in social protection reform have concentrated mainly on social assistance. Non-contributory
tax-ﬁnanced protection schemes, including public works
programmes and different types of cash transfer programmes
for the poor and vulnerable, are especially important in
contexts where the informal economy is widespread, the
majority of the population works in the agricultural sector,

and chronic poverty and persistent deprivation affect large
segments of the population. In these settings, social protection has to include policies that enhance people’s living
conditions and enable them to lift themselves out of poverty. The provision of an income source to poor and vulnerable households through the social assistance programmes
reviewed in the chapter is a step in the right direction.
Such programmes frequently target based on income and
impose conditionalities. These principles are questionable
and do not necessarily produce the expected results, especially when investments in the programmes are minimal
and not supported by efforts to tackle the structural causes
of economic insecurity. Rather, targeted social assistance
should be used as a complement to universal schemes and
services, and not as a substitute for them. When cash transfers are provided on a universal, unconditional, stable and
long-term basis, they have a stronger potential to boost people’s capabilities to pursue a decent and sustainable livelihood. Non-conditional cash transfer programmes, such as
child beneﬁts and old-age pensions, which are based on
categorical targeting rather than means-testing, seem to be
more promising paths for the extension of social protection
in developing countries.
Ultimately, the extension of social protection schemes
cannot be separated from efforts to create sustainable and
employment-intensive growth paths and advance democratic participation. Both of these pursuits facilitate inclusion of more citizens into contributory social insurance
programmes and the ﬁnancing of social assistance out of
general revenues.

Universal social services are a key component
of transformative social policy
Social services – in areas such as health, education, care, and
water and sanitation – can enhance individual well-being
and raise productivity, contributing to a rise in the overall
quality of life. Such services enable families to care for and
sustain their members and reduce both the costs and time
burden of work and other daily activities. They increase the

17

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

chances that individuals and their families can break out of
poverty and live digniﬁed and productive lives. The kinds,
quantity and quality of services individuals enjoy provide
a good measure of their well-being: indeed, poverty can be
perceived as a failure to achieve certain basic capabilities
arising in part from the absence of social services.19

The kinds, quantity and quality of
services individuals enjoy provide a
good measure of their well-being
The instrumental value of services, particularly education and health care, in promoting growth and alleviating poverty and inequality is now widely acknowledged in
academic and policy circles. Evidence clearly demonstrates
the complementarities among different services (health,
education, water, sanitation and nutrition, for example),
as well as between social service provision and other economic policy goals, such as increased productivity. Moreover, access to certain social services, speciﬁcally education
and health care, is considered a right enshrined in numerous United Nations declarations, a key goal of rights-based
approaches to development, and essential to the achievement of several MDGs.
Chapter 6 argues that a universal approach to the provision
of social services is essential to realizing their full potential
as a component of transformative social policy. Achieving
broad-based and inclusive coverage can contribute not only
to improved well-being, but also to enhanced productivity
and earnings and to reduced inequalities across income,
class, gender, ethnicity and location. The challenge of
extending effective provision to populations often marginalized or excluded by these inequalities lies at the heart
of efforts to reduce poverty and reach the targets of the
MDGs. Narrowly targeted interventions may make inroads
into particular aspects of poverty for speciﬁc population
groups. However, without broad-based coverage that aims
to redress such inequalities and generate solidarity around
development goals, these gains may not be sustainable.

18

Drawing on evidence principally from the health and education sectors, the chapter argues that integrated systems of
social service provision grounded in universal principles can
be redistributive, act as powerful drivers of solidarity and
social inclusion, and improve the capabilities of the poor.
By contrast, systems that are fragmented – with multiple
providers, programmes and ﬁnancing mechanisms aimed
at different population groups – have limited potential for
redistribution, and generally result in high costs, poor quality and limited access for the poor. Dominant policy trends
since the 1980s, in a context of crisis, liberalization and
public sector retrenchment, have been towards the commercialization of social services, undermining previous
progress towards universal access in many countries, raising
out-of-pocket costs particularly for the poor, and intensifying inequality and exclusion.
The chapter draws on the experience of countries that have
pursued different paths in the provision of social services at
varying income levels. The evidence shows that it is possible to institute social service regimes that lean towards
universalism at relatively low income levels. It demonstrates the importance of substantial public involvement –
whether in direct provision or in the ﬁnancing or effective
regulation of services. Public interventions are essential to
ensure that services reach rural and remote areas, urban
slums, and marginalized groups, and thus that their productivity-enhancing and distributional beneﬁts are obtained.

Unpaid care work is an essential but often
invisible contribution to well-being
A neglected but important and often invisible input to
well-being is the unpaid work that goes into sustaining
families, households and societies. This includes direct care
of persons (whether young, old, frail or able-bodied) as well
as the other activities that are preconditions for personal
caregiving, such as preparing meals, shopping and cleaning.
In countries where access to piped water, electricity, sanitation and technology is limited, these tasks are particularly
time-consuming and arduous, and women and girls are often
the main providers of these services. There are, however,

OVERVIEW

serious limits to how far burdens can be shifted from the visible parts of the economy (the public sector, markets) to the
invisible and unpaid economy of households, families and
communities. These limits are often stretched in crisis situations, where public services are overburdened and underfunded and market provision is out of reach. When such a
crisis occurs, households and families are forced to cope on
their own, which can damage human capabilities, entrench
class and gender inequalities, create care deﬁcits and erode
the social fabric. Chapter 7 addresses these issues.
To monitor policy effectiveness in meeting care needs and
in reducing and equalizing care burdens, timely and regular
indicators are needed to capture both inputs into caregiving and outcomes in terms of enhanced well-being and
reduced poverty. Despite its enormous impact on poverty,
well-being and development outcomes, unpaid care work is
excluded from calculations of GDP. Similarly, no mention
is made of such work in the MDGs, despite its importance
in meeting many of the goals (including reducing child
mortality, achieving universal primary education and combating major diseases). In other words, there is a need for
better measures of the inputs into care (including time and
money), rather than capturing only some of the outputs, in
terms of improved health and education.
The chapter shows that while highly specialized social care
services (such as early childhood care, elderly care and care
for those with disabilities) tend to be underdeveloped in
many lower income developing countries, policies that
are good for care are not a luxury that only high-income
countries can afford. Care policies more broadly conceived
are often harnessed to a variety of policy goals, from social
protection and assistance, to employment, infrastructure
development, and education and health services, which are
not limited to established welfare states.
However, policy conﬁgurations and priorities are context
speciﬁc. In many low-income countries, investment in
social infrastructure can signiﬁcantly reduce the drudgery
of unpaid domestic work and free up time for other pursuits. Likewise, the availability of decent work and universal health and education services can help reduce the

burden of care assumed by families and households. For
many middle-income countries that are putting in place
preschool education and care programmes, often through
a mix of public and private providers, the challenge is not
only to expand coverage, but to do so in a way that reduces
class and regional inequalities so that the policy rhetoric
of equal opportunity does not remain a mantra. The policy
challenge is to shift from strategies that rely on fragmented
market and voluntary-sector provision of the most informal
and exploitative kind to strategies that nurture professional
and compassionate forms of care. This can be accomplished
through effective regulations that involve states and organizations of care workers and of care recipients. The goal is
to build public conﬁdence in such services and sustain their
ﬁnancing, through general taxation where possible.

A number of studies of low-income countries with good
social indicators have shown that social policy is affordable
even at low levels of development. Chapter 8 describes how
funds can be generated for social programmes through various sources – internally through taxation and social insurance schemes, externally in the form of aid or remittances
or, for mineral-rich countries, by channelling resource rents.
In the ﬁnal analysis, decisions about revenue policies and
how to allocate public funds are political. The ﬁnancing
of social expenditure has distributional effects, and not all
groups may beneﬁt equally from public transfer schemes and
social investments. Inﬂuential groups may oppose progressive direct taxes on wealth and income, especially if such
groups do not beneﬁt directly from the funded programmes.

19

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

There is a strong case to be made, therefore, that the more
universal social programmes are, the easier it is to support
them through progressive funding policies in which highincome groups pay relatively more.
The chapter highlights a number of issues that are relevant
in mobilizing different revenue sources to ﬁnance social policy. Tax and social insurance schemes tend to be highly varied in both developed and developing countries, with labour
market characteristics and policy models playing a major
role. High-tax (including social contributions) regimes
are more common in countries following a manufacturingled growth path, such as the East Asian developmental
states, the former socialist countries in Eastern Europe and
Central Asia and some of the dualist states, such as Brazil
and South Africa. Tax shares are usually lower in countries
following a growth path led by services, minerals or agriculture.
Improving tax systems and extending coverage of contributory social insurance or pension schemes remain a challenge
for most developing countries, especially where informality is widespread and state capacity is weak. Pension funds
combine the protective and productive functions of social
policy since they provide old-age security and can be used to
ﬁnance investment in social infrastructure. Macroeconomic
stability and regulatory capacity are preconditions for making funded pension schemes work and, even then, important
ﬁnancial risks remain – as the global ﬁnancial and economic
crisis has demonstrated. Privatization of public pension
schemes, a reform option that was highly recommended in the
Washington consensus period of the late 1980s, has shown
a poor record in terms of coverage and redistribution and
produces high ﬁscal costs for several decades.
Revenues from booming commodity sectors open up the
possibility of channelling more of these rents into social
programmes. However, prudent management particularly
of mineral rents is crucial in coping with the effects of
price volatility and “Dutch disease” (a situation in which
the real exchange rate appreciates in periods of resource
booms, thereby negatively affecting competitiveness in
non-mineral tradable sectors, particularly agriculture
and industry). Aid ﬂows, although still lagging behind
donor promises, are of special importance to low-income

20

countries and have a positive impact on public social
spending. To be more effective, aid ﬂows should be predictable and increase national capacity and policy space.
Remittances are of growing importance to many countries
and contribute to poverty reduction, higher income security and increased social expenditures in households that
receive them. However, remittances lose their countercyclical role during global shocks, such as the 2008–2009
economic crisis, and, more importantly, should not be considered a substitute for domestic income creation and policies for providing universal social services.
The chapter concludes that domestic ﬁnancing instruments
such as taxation and social insurance are best suited to creating synergies between economic and social development,
to strengthening links that foster democracy and solidarity,
and to supporting a social contract between citizens and their
political leaders. They should form the bedrock of instruments
that ﬁnance social policies. External ﬁnancing, although
second best from an economic and political point of view,
has the potential to complement public domestic ﬁnancing,
especially in low-income countries that are characterized by
a high degree of informality, low tax takes and low coverage
of social insurance schemes. The global economic crisis puts
further pressure on both types of ﬁnancing resources.

Section Three:
The Politics of Poverty Reduction
Power relations lie at the centre of development. What
interests prevail in the political arena and how such interests are translated into effective policies underpin all successful attempts at signiﬁcant poverty reduction. Strategies
that seek to bring about changes in poverty and inequality
must therefore take into account the need to shift relationships and the exercise of power. Active citizenship, mediated through group politics, is central in this regard and
in ensuring that governments and corporations respond to
social needs. Such strategies need effective states that are

OVERVIEW

able to mobilize and direct resources to productive sectors;
regulate business and other actors whose decisions affect
public welfare; establish social pacts for managing the process of development; and fund, provide and regulate services and social programmes.

The corporate social responsibility agenda
remains limited in its scope and effectiveness
The dominance of a pro-market development ideology in
recent decades has generated fundamental changes in relations between state, society and business actors. Economic
and governance trends have not only expanded commercial opportunities for transnational corporations and other
enterprises; they have also drawn them more directly into
the arenas of social policy and poverty reduction. This is
particularly apparent in four areas: the role of business in
the privatization of social services; the adoption of corporate social responsibility (CSR) principles and practices;
new roles for business organizations in standard setting and
other aspects of business regulation; and participation (particularly of large corporations and business associations)
in processes of global governance and public policy. These
changes in state-business-society relations contrast with
the traditional role of business in social development. In
countries where poverty was reduced relatively quickly, this
role varied considerably. But it centred to a large extent
on some combination of employment generation, tax payments, philanthropy, corporate social welfare obligations
and implicit support for welfare states.
Today’s world is quite different. The number of transnational
corporations has vastly increased, as has their economic
power. Moreover, corporate tax rates have declined sharply
over more than two decades, the percentage of workers covered by company health plans has decreased in many countries, and social pacts that aligned business interests with
welfare state models have weakened. At the same time,
international development policy has made an important
shift towards engaging the private sector far more directly
and proactively in national and international strategies to
raise social and environmental standards and reduce poverty.

More and more companies are associating themselves with
the MDGs, participating in public-private partnerships concerned with the provision of basic services, adopting voluntary initiatives associated with an expanding CSR agenda,
and targeting the world’s poor in their investment, production and marketing strategies. However, whether or not such
approaches enhance corporate accountability and promote
inclusive development remains an open question.
The discussion in chapter 9 reveals that the mainstream
CSR agenda, which supports the notion that businesses can
signiﬁcantly improve their social and environmental performance through voluntary initiatives, has raised awareness of the societal impact and responsibility of business
and the need to regulate business activities. However, the
agenda remains limited in scope and effectiveness. It covers
only a small fraction of transnational corporations and the
private sector more generally and tends to promote particular regulatory instruments that are quite weak in practice.
Furthermore, it pays scant attention to both key aspects of
business behaviour and assessing developmental outcomes,
and often ignores the structural context and power relations
that shape business conduct. In view of the limitations of
this approach, the analysis suggests that far greater attention must be paid to the notion of corporate accountability
and the way business interests inﬂuence public policy.

Far greater attention must be paid to
the notion of corporate accountability
and the way business interests
inﬂuence public policy
The analysis suggests that, from the perspective of inclusive development, a key challenge is reasserting social control over markets and large corporations via various forms
of regulation and the reconﬁguration of power relations.
A crucial element is the need to strengthen countervailing forces and institutional arrangements, including state
regulatory and inspection capacity. Rather than seeing
voluntary initiatives as a preferred option to mandatory

21

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

regulation, an important area of regulatory design lies at the
interface of voluntary and legalistic approaches. Clearly in
the context of globalization, international norms and law
must play a crucial role in regulating transnational corporations and mobile capital. But the tendency for international
“hard” law to be reserved for strengthening corporate rights
associated with foreign direct investment, trade liberalization and intellectual property, and international “soft” law
and voluntary norms for promoting corporate responsibility, needs to be corrected.
The chapter concludes by advocating support for
• civil society action and broad-based coalitions to
moderate perverse business inﬂuences and practices;
• the forging of social pacts between business
and government;
• the promotion of international norms and law that
regulate transnational corporations; and
• the building of effective state capacity to
regulate business.

State capacity for poverty reduction can be
built from the ground up
Chapter 10 discusses the institutions, policies and dynamics that have enabled some states to build up developmental and welfare-enhancing capacities. Countries that
have succeeded in alleviating poverty in a relatively short
time span had purposeful, growth-oriented and welfareenhancing political systems; they also created and maintained competent bureaucracies. Successful states often
lacked the appropriate bureaucracies when they embarked
on their development projects, but they subsequently built
them. Building state capacity requires a focus on three crucial dimensions: crafting effective political capacity; mobilizing resources for development objectives; and allocating
resources to productive and welfare-enhancing sectors and
enforcing rules governing their use.
Strategies for constructing these three dimensions of state
capacity differ in authoritarian and democratic regimes.
Authoritarian strategies tend to be top-down, whereas

22

democracies are usually compelled to engage citizens more
actively in the building of capacities. Authoritarian strategies were lauded in much of the development literature of
the 1960s as necessary to accelerate the growth process,
achieve modernization and build nation-states out of complex ethnic cleavages that tended to undermine stability.
However, in most countries such strategies turned out to be
unstable and non-developmental and provoked pressures for
democratization. A few countries, largely those in East Asia,
did succeed in transforming their economies and breaking
out of poverty in a sustained way. And they shared with
democratic developmental states an ability to provide wideranging and good quality services to broad sections of the
populace. But even for these authoritarian developmental
states, coercion alone was insufﬁcient to construct effective
state capacity. And authoritarian approaches to state-building proved unsustainable in the long run. All of these varied
experiences suggest that developmental outcomes can be
achieved without recourse to authoritarian practices.

Countries that have succeeded in
alleviating poverty had purposeful,
growth-oriented and welfare-enhancing
political systems; they also created and
maintained competent bureaucracies
Chapter 10 argues that high levels of domestic resource mobilization or ﬁscal capacity can improve policy space, enable
governments to avoid capture by powerful groups, anchor the
state in society, provide state leadership in the development
process and strengthen capacity to inﬂuence the behaviour of
investors and service providers. What distinguishes successful from unsuccessful states in directing development is the
latter’s failure to generate governance capacities to enforce
rules on how the resources allocated are used. Allocative
and enforcement capacities can be improved through citizen
participation in monitoring development agents and service providers. For this to happen, governments must provide
the necessary information and support that can help citizen
groups to hold business agents and providers to account.

OVERVIEW

Current approaches to state building have focused largely
on market-enhancing strategies of good governance, managerialism (or New Public Management) and decentralization. Many of these are desirable goals for all countries.
However, they should not be confused with the institutions required for generating and sustaining growth and
producing socially equitable outcomes. The large degree of
overlap in the good governance scores of developing countries with high growth and those with poor growth suggests
that growth is not likely to be sustained in poor countries
by simply implementing market-enhancing reforms. However, the high disparity in growth rates between converging and diverging countries also suggests major differences
in the efﬁciency of resource use, which may be due to signiﬁcant differences in other types of governance capabilities ignored by the good governance agenda. Managerial
reforms that improve service delivery to the poor require
high levels of regulatory capacity, which can be achieved
when countries have been able to create the basic foundations of a Weberian or modern bureaucracy. The impact of
decentralization on poverty is ambiguous. Success requires
both governing elites committed to changing local power
structures in favour of the poor and a network of citizen
groups that can engage in policy-making processes.

In democratic societies, poverty reduction is
ultimately a question of political power
The types of development policies states pursue and the
possibilities for achieving redistributive outcomes depend
substantially on politics, the way power is distributed,
and the institutions that structure state-society relations.
Social movements and interest groups do not often organize around issues of poverty per se.20 Rather, they frame
their discourse around rights, asset distribution, services,
or work-related earnings and beneﬁts, which opens up the
possibility of addressing the structural roots of poverty.
Although democracies offer opportunities for participation
and contestation in policy making, redistributive outcomes
cannot be taken for granted. Indeed, many new democracies have fallen short in promoting general well-being
and redistribution.

Chapter 11 examines the politics of reducing poverty and
inequality within a democratic context. It presents evidence that shows that current democracies face two types
of constraints. The ﬁrst is the capture of economic policy
by investors, ﬁnancial institutions and donors through
various types of conditionality. Governments face considerable pressure to limit policy making to technocrats and
to limit policy options to a set of objectives that emphasize
ﬁscal restraint, privatization and liberalization. In the process, governments become more answerable to multilateral
agencies and investors than to representative institutions
and the wider public. Such styles of policy making affect
the way governments respond to issues of employment and
social policies, which may be sidelined or forced to conform
to predetermined policy objectives that emphasize ﬁscal stability. The second constraint relates to the limited nature
of industrial transformation in most new democracies, the
varying quality of democratic institutions and processes,
and ethnic cleavages that shape choices and capacity for
collective action.
Even though the PRSPs support the participation of social
groups in designing anti-poverty programmes, the process has mostly been reduced to consultation rather than
genuine engagement that effects real change. The type of
participation associated with the social pacts that produced
rapid poverty reduction historically differs substantially
from the NGO–centred bargaining approach of the PRSPs,
in which the balance of power is strongly weighted against
these groups. In the past, successful participation took the
form of social pacts. Key features of such pacts included
the recognition granted to representatives of labour and
employers in negotiations over wages, employment, working conditions and welfare; the ability of group representatives to ensure members’ compliance when decisions
were reached; and the mutual recognition of each actor’s
importance in achieving goals, including the relative
capacities of parties to obstruct outcomes that were not
based on consensus. Such pacts were not conﬁned to the
industrial sector. Agrarian pacts were also forged in many
countries and improved farm incomes as well as narrowed
rural-urban inequalities in countries where farmers’ votes
were important.

23

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Using ﬁve broad types of cases involving interest group and
social movement activism, the chapter reveals that democracies have been able to deliver outcomes that are beneﬁcial to the poor under the following circumstances:
• when rights are institutionalized, allowing the poor to
exercise political choice, build alliances with others
and hold leaders to account;
• when groups with strong ties to the poor demonstrate
capacity for organization and mobilization;
• when they are able to transcend or reconcile horizontal
divisions; and
• when they create structural links to actors involved in
policy making, leading, at times, to social pacts.

In some contexts, success can be achieved without formal
group ties to state actors, but this requires high levels of contestation and continuous mobilization to sustain gains. Electoral competitiveness in which there is a high probability
that governments may lose ofﬁce can also act as an incentive
for redistribution and progressive reforms. However, electoral competitiveness without effective group organization
and contestation may produce weak redistributive outcomes
or conﬁne redistribution to the electoral cycle. The poor suffer when interest groups and social movements are weak and
the electoral system is not sufﬁciently competitive.

Concluding Remarks
Coordinating economic, social and political
forces to deliver for the poor
The concluding section highlights the importance of understanding the ways in which institutions and polices are
interconnected. Combating poverty and inequality requires
processes of structural change, macroeconomic policies
and social policies that are complementary and synergistic.
Such interconnections need to be consciously designed.
Achieving policy coherence, however, is much more than
a technocratic exercise. It also needs to be backed by active
citizenship and sufﬁciently powerful coalitions.

SOCIALLY INCLUSIVE
STRUCTURAL CHANGE
Section One

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Poverty is reduced when economic growth and structural change both generate employment
and ensure a distribution of beneﬁts that improves well-being for all. Over the past half-century,
most developing countries have not achieved sustained growth; nor has growth generated
sufﬁcient productive employment to reduce poverty. The classic employment-generating growth
path – which saw labour move from agriculture to the manufacturing sector – is not being
replicated in today’s developing economies. In poor countries, most labour leaving agriculture
goes into low-productivity activities in the informal economy rather than into industry. Only a few
late industrializers have succeeded in emulating the pattern of structural transformation of the
advanced economies, doing so through strategic state support for both industry and agriculture.
By contrast, the majority of low-income countries are on alternative paths of structural change
which, in many cases, are associated with highly segmented and unequal labour markets.
This section examines the potential for different patterns of structural change to generate
productive employment and their implications for inequality. Income and wealth inequality have
risen in most countries, particularly during the last two decades, for a number of reasons.
These include ﬁnancial and trade liberalization, stabilization policies that fail to protect the
poor, regressive tax regimes, and labour market policies that increase casual, informal and
unprotected employment. The structure of the labour market is a particularly important factor in
generating or sustaining exclusion or inequalities along multiple dimensions – not only income
or class status, but also by region, ethnicity and gender.
Structural change affects regions and ethnic groups differently. Some regions and groups
may experience high levels of poverty and remain disadvantaged even when economies are
growing and overall levels of inequality and poverty are low or falling. Ethnic inequalities may be
reinforced by discriminatory public policies and differential access to governance institutions as
well as the way in which labour markets are structured.
Like ethnic inequalities, gender inequalities, as well as the relationship between poverty and
gender, are complex. They are found across a wide spectrum of institutions, both private and
public. While positive changes in gender relations are associated with the social transformations
that accompany economic development, these changes are not simply a by-product of economic
growth. On the contrary, some patterns of growth and structural change are premised on, and
reinforce, gender inequalities. Thus, while women’s access to paid work has increased in most
countries in recent decades, the terms and conditions of much of that work have deteriorated.
A range of complementary policies can foster patterns of structural change that are inclusive
and generate employment, enhance well-being and reduce inequality. These include growthenhancing macroeconomic policies, strategic industrial policies, support for agriculture and
food security, and ensuring broad access to productive assets (including land); labour market
policies that expand employment opportunities and remuneration, and decent conditions of work
through appropriate forms of regulation; and redistributive and transformative social policies
– investment in social infrastructure, services and transfers, and afﬁrmative action policies –
supported by progressive forms of taxation.

28

CHAPTER

Towards EmploymentCentred Structural Change
A fundamental precondition for poverty reduction is a pattern of growth and structural change that generates productive employment, improves earnings and contributes to
the welfare of the population. Employment policies must
ﬁgure centrally in development strategies if such a pattern of growth is to occur. The 1995 World Summit for
Social Development refocused the world’s attention on the
centrality of employment in social development, committing governments “to promote full employment as a basic
priority of economic and social policies, and to enable all
men and women to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and
work”.1 Nevertheless, the dominant development policy
approaches of the following decade, as reﬂected, for example, in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs),
largely ignored employment. Even the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) subsume employment under the
goal of halving extreme poverty and hunger. While inclusion in the MDGs of the target of “full and productive
employment and decent work for all” is a timely acknowledgement of its importance, the strategies for achieving
this target remain unclear.
This chapter outlines elements of a framework for incorporating employment more centrally in development policy.
It highlights the potential and limits of different growth
paths in generating employment, and argues that economic
growth or industrialization per se will not necessarily lead
to sustained improvements in employment, income and
well-being. The classic pattern of structural change found
in today’s high-income countries, in which economic
growth fuelled a shift from agriculture to industry and from
industry to services, as well as a shift from self-employment
to formal wage employment, is difﬁcult to replicate in the
context of open economies without deliberate policies.
Labour still moves out of agriculture in the vast majority
of countries, but it is absorbed into low-value services and

1

the informal sector where the scope for sustained growth in
productivity and incomes is limited. Poverty in most parts
of the developing world is in large part accounted for by
this pattern of structural change. The free-market orientation of development policy in the last few decades is associated with expanding labour market inequalities, persistent
informalization and the emergence of precarious forms of
employment in many countries.

The free-market orientation of
development policy is associated with
labour market inequalities, persistent
informalization and the emergence of
precarious forms of employment

Public policy is critical for generating a pattern of structural
change that creates employment and reduces poverty. However, there is no one-size-ﬁts-all approach to employment
policy, and the institutions critical for achieving inclusive
outcomes often lie outside the labour market itself. Macroeconomic policy, ﬁnancial institutions, the international
structure of production, the nature and composition of
households, gender dynamics and social policy all inﬂuence employment outcomes and the potential for better
opportunities to translate into real differences in people’s
lives. Effective policy interventions will depend on existing structures of employment and particular institutional
and economic contexts. At a general level, and taking
each country’s structure of employment as a starting
point, policies must address problems of insufﬁcient labour
demand, improve the quality of existing employment and
facilitate labour mobility. In addition, the process of development involves the transformation of the structure of

29

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

employment – not simply improving opportunities in existing activities. The long-term challenge is to move human
resources into higher value added activities and raise the
level of labour productivity.

Countries successful in reducing
poverty quite rapidly used industrial
and agricultural policies and active
social policies to facilitate employmentcentred structural transformations

Countries that have been successful in reducing poverty in
relatively short periods of time used industrial and agricultural policies as well as active social policies to facilitate
employment-centred structural transformations. Similar kinds of interventions can be used in many countries
today to transform the structure of employment, nurture
productive linkages between industry and agriculture, and
encourage the development, in the longer term, of a solid
foundation for decent work opportunities. Such strategies,
however, will have to be sensitive to the constraints of climate change, which require additional efforts to support
technological capacities that will propel countries to highgrowth paths that are low carbon-intensive.2
The evidence presented in this chapter points to four main
conclusions.
• Economic growth is important, but alone it does not
necessarily reduce poverty and inequality. Employment
represents a critical channel through which additional
income generated by growth can be widely distributed
throughout a population, and therefore deserves more
focused policy attention.
• Structural change can have multiple paths, involving
different types of industrialization, primary sector
or service-led development. Countries that are
stalled in low-productivity activities in agriculture,
mineral extraction or services tend to produce highly
segmented and unequal labour markets, generate

30

limited employment opportunities and offer little in the
way of social protection.
• The employment-centred policies that successfully
eradicated poverty in late industrializing countries
are incompatible with neoliberal development
strategies more recently adopted by most countries.
Successful countries invested substantially in
infrastructure; channelled credit to speciﬁc productive
activities; and pursued well-managed industrial
and agricultural policies, as well as active social
policies that improved the skill levels and welfare
of the population.
• For many countries where industrialization has
stalled or barely taken off, a signiﬁcant challenge lies
in improving the quality of service and agricultural
employment, instead of pursuing a single objective
of increased industrial production. Such challenges
take on growing importance in light of food and
environmental crises.
The chapter is organized as follows.
Section 1 explores the relationship between structural
change and employment. It examines why the traditional
model of industrialization is difﬁcult to replicate in the setting of an open economy, the implications for employment
outcomes and the role of policy.
Section 2 discusses signiﬁcant global changes in the supply
of labour: urbanization, growing participation of women
in the labour force, integration of the global workforce
and migration.
Section 3 uses country case studies to illustrate ﬁve different
development paths, including the structure and evolution
of employment and development strategies, and implications for poverty and living standards.
Section 4 discusses the relationship between employment
and poverty, focusing on the working poor.
Section 5 concludes with a discussion of policy issues for
promoting employment-centred structural change.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 1 – TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT-CENTRED STRUCTURAL CHANGE

Structural change involves continuous shifts in the shares
of manufacturing, services and agriculture in output and
employment in favour of more dynamic sectors. How these
sectors are organized, and how individuals, groups and
communities are integrated into them have implications
for livelihoods. Employment represents the single most
important source of income for the majority of the world’s
people – either directly through their participation in the
labour market, or indirectly through their membership in
households sustained by earnings from employment. Structural change that improves employment opportunities will
therefore be more inclusive than that in which the quality of employment stagnates or deteriorates. Conversely,
unequal access to decent work and persistent labour market
inequalities will frustrate efforts to reduce poverty.

Structural change that generates decent
work will improve people’s livelihoods

Data comparing countries by per capita income (ﬁgures 1.1,
1.2 and 1.3) illustrate that the basic tendency of economic
growth is a shift out of agricultural employment. Figure 1.1
shows the relationship between per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) and the share of agricultural employment
for 120 countries. A distinct negative relationship is evident: as per capita income increases, agricultural employment, as a share of total employment, drops signiﬁcantly,
approaching zero among the highest income countries.

As economies develop they undergo changes in the structure of production that have direct implications for the
quality and quantity of employment opportunities. The
pattern of economic development associated with today’s
high-income countries is a shift away from agriculture
towards manufacturing, other types of industrial production and services, and a shift from self-employment to
formal wage employment.3 As labour and capital move
from agriculture into more dynamic activities, average productivity in the economy climbs, further enhancing the
demand for services and industrial products. Agriculture
will also experience improvements in productivity, since
the urban industrial population has to be fed by a declining rural labour force. Structural change is often accompanied by changes in the demographic structure, with fertility
rates declining as countries industrialize and move up the
income scale.4

Figure 1.2 shows that industrial employment, as a share
of total employment, increases with per capita income up
to about 30 per cent of total employment on average and
thereafter begins to decline.5 This relatively low peak of
30 per cent suggests that it is unrealistic to expect the industrial sector ever to employ the majority of the labour force.
The level of per capita income at which de-industrialization begins to occur has fallen (in this case, de-industrialization is deﬁned by a fall in manufacturing’s share of total
employment as per capita income increases).6 However,
it should be noted that the distinction between manufacturing and services is becoming blurred, especially in
high-income economies. Manufacturing ﬁrms outsource
many of their service activities to service ﬁrms and use
intermediate inputs from independent service providers.7

31

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Figure 1.3 shows the strong positive relationship between the
share of employment in services and per capita income.
In many high-income economies, services account for
70 to 80 per cent of all employment. For low-income countries, services account for 20 to 30 per cent of total employment, but still create more jobs than industry.

The traditional pattern of structural change
may not apply in a globalized world
Despite the broad tendencies suggested by these ﬁgures,
the traditional pattern of structural change may not
apply in a world with open economies and networks of
globalized production and trade. Globalization weakens the organic links between agriculture and industry,
since an urban population can be fed by importing food
rather than by supporting domestic agricultural production. The demand for manufactured goods can also be met
by increased imports rather than by expanding domestic
production. And global competition in the production of
manufactured goods may lead to productivity improvements, which can cause industrial employment to fall
behind industrial output.

Increases in the rate of productivity growth tend to slow
the rate of employment growth (see table 1.1). During
the period 1961–1970, for example, a 1 percentage point
increase in the growth rate of productivity resulted in a
0.07 percentage point reduction in the rate of employment
growth – a very small effect. However, in the period 2001–
2008, the same 1 percentage point increase in the growth
rate of productivity resulted in a 0.54 per cent decline in
the growth rate of employment – a much more signiﬁcant
impact. This suggests that by 2008, productivity improvements or macroeconomic policies were no longer supporting growth in aggregate demand in the same way they did
in the past.

Notes: Employment is measured by number of workers. Productivity is measured by GDP per worker. Data are from 35 countries in Asia, Latin America and Eastern
Europe. The database only contained information on the total labour force, not employment, for countries in Africa and the Middle East. The estimated equation
included a lagged endogenous variable (the growth rate of employment lagged one period) and country-ﬁxed effects. Time series data were taken from the Groningen Growth and Development Centre, Total Economy Database. Source: Heintz 2009.

These characteristics of the relationship between productivity growth and employment growth apply across all
sectors of the economy. However, the change in this relationship is more pronounced for the industrial sector than
for other sectors, since the scope for productivity growth is
larger. This could lead to a divergence between the industrialization of output and that of employment.
Greater openness in trade is probably the primary cause
of the growing divergence between output and employment growth.8 In addition, macroeconomic policies that
aim to restrict domestic demand in order to stabilize rates
of inﬂation and public debt may also contribute to such
divergence. In low-income countries in particular, public expenditure contraction tends to be directed not only
at the employment-intensive social sectors, such as
health and education, but also at spending that directly
affects agriculture, which is a major source of livelihoods.

This leads to less direct job creation by government, and
also less indirect impact through multiplier effects.

The trajectories of structural change
experienced in most countries today
differ from the development paths of
high-income countries
Different trajectories of structural change, therefore, can
be observed in most countries today. Movement out of agriculture is still occurring, but the resulting labour force is not
automatically absorbed into the industrial sector. Instead,
workers move disproportionately into the service sector
and informal employment, where the scope for sustained
growth in productivity and improvements in incomes is

33

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

limited. In recent decades, a few countries in East Asia
have undergone an industrial transformation similar
to the one experienced in the high-income countries.
They used interventionist industrial and other policies,
managed trade, close ﬁnance-industry links and social
policies that raised the skill level of their labour force.
The share of industrial employment grew and living
standards rose signiﬁcantly. However, maintaining a standard of work that provides adequate remuneration and
protection is difﬁcult even for these countries that have
successfully industrialized.

2. Emerging Trends
in Employment
So far, this chapter has discussed the various relationships
observed between economic development and the structure
of employment. The discussion has focused on how structural shifts in domestic demand for goods and services and
in productivity affect the level and composition of labour
demand. In recent years, however, developments on the
supply side of labour markets around the world have been
far reaching. This section highlights four labour supply
issues that are of particular importance in understanding
household incomes and poverty risks: urbanization, growing participation by women in the labour force, greater
integration of the global workforce, and migration.

Household incomes are affected by
the dynamics of global labour supply

Table 1.2 illustrates recent trends in the growth of urban
populations, total population and industrial employment for 11 developing countries. In all cases, the urban
population is growing faster than the total population
(note that these are annual average growth rates spanning
20 to 25 years).

Urbanization is growing in
high- and low-income countries
The table shows a positive relationship between the growth
rate of the urban population and the growth rate of industrial employment. This suggests that as labour demand in the
industrial sector increases, so does rural-to-urban migration.
However, in most of the countries examined here, growth
in the urban population exceeds the growth in industrial
employment opportunities. This indicates that, over time,
industrial employment will account for a decreasing share of
total urban employment. Rural-to-urban migrants who are
not employed in industrial jobs will work in the service sector or in informal employment, or will become unemployed.
Of course, not all industrial employment is located in urban
areas, but the majority of such opportunities are concentrated in and around cities. In most countries, earnings even
from informal urban employment on average remain above
earnings in agriculture, providing an incentive for continued rural-to-urban migration even when there are few
opportunities for industrial jobs. Continued urbanization in
contexts where employment opportunities are limited may
place downward pressure on urban earnings, while informal
employment is typically precarious and poorly remunerated
and with little, if any, social protection.

Urbanization
An increasing share of the world’s population lives in towns
and urban centres.9 Though the urban share of the population is highest in high-income countries and lowest in lowincome countries, growing urbanization is a phenomenon
experienced by all country groupings.10 This raises serious
questions as to whether demand for labour in urban areas
will grow sufﬁciently to absorb the expanding workforce.

in informal employment, or will

Growing labour force participation by women
Another important trend is the notable increase in women’s participation in paid work, which increased globally by
more than 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.11 Chapter
4 addresses this issue in greater detail. Women’s increased
labour force participation has coincided with limited
growth in formal industrial employment and the more
rapid increase in the share of service and informal forms
of employment. More women around the world are being
employed in service rather than industrial activities, which
are often more poorly paid and offer less social protection.

more outward-oriented economic policies, the number of
workers engaged in production for the global market has
increased enormously in recent decades. Expansion in the
global pool of labour has outstripped the increase in the
global pool of capital, making labour relatively more abundant and capital relatively scarcer.12 The result has been
downward pressure on wages, at least until global capital
accumulation can catch up. The almost universal decline
in wage shares of national income (see chapter 2) can be
at least partly explained by this wider process. The relative
scarcity of capital has been made more severe by neoliberal
policies that discouraged ﬁxed capital investment.13

Increasing global labour supply
Growing involvement of women in paid work is part of
a wider process of expansion in the global labour supply.
With market reforms in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and,
perhaps most signiﬁcantly, China, and India’s adoption of

The rise in the share of manufactured exports originating in developing economies represents one dimension of
the integration of the global workforce. In 1960, manufactured goods accounted for only 12 per cent of developing

35

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

countries’ exports; by 2000 they accounted for about
67 per cent. Not only are developing countries competing
with the established manufacturing sectors of advanced
industrial nations, they also are competing with each other.
This shift has coincided with declining terms of trade for
certain types of manufactured goods, especially labourintensive ones, which account for the bulk of poor countries’ manufactured exports.14 The competitive pressures
may make industrial development more difﬁcult as gains
from trade deteriorate over time and erode the resources
available to invest in upgrading industrial production.

The number of workers engaged in
production for the global market has
increased enormously in recent decades
and average wages have decreased in
low-skill sectors
International migration
International migration plays a complex role in labour supply. While the proportion of international migrants in the
world population has remained broadly stable at around
3 per cent, the total number grew to nearly 200 million by
2005, including refugees and asylum seekers. Most migrants
go abroad for economic reasons, however, and are unevenly
distributed across the world. For countries with high levels of
out-migration, such as Ghana, Mexico and the Philippines,
remittances from employment constitute a sizeable inﬂow of
ﬁnancial resources. In high-income countries, migrants tend
to be concentrated in low-paid, precarious and unprotected
forms of employment. In the United States, for example, noncitizens account for a disproportionate share of day labourers,
part-time workers and temporary hires – categories of work
that tend to be signiﬁcantly more precarious. In some cases,
migrant workers are caught up in highly exploitative, illegal
employment arrangements. Despite these labour market
disadvantages, remittances ﬁnanced through employment
income and sent back to the migrant’s country of origin
often constitute a sizeable component of household income,
thereby reducing the risk of poverty (see chapter 8).

36

3. How Different Patterns
of Development Affect
Employment
Employment includes not only wage employment but also
the work of the self-employed, from farmers and artisans to
petty traders and informal load carriers, who engage in market transactions to obtain remuneration for their labour.
The experiences of different countries can highlight the
potential of different patterns of development to decrease
poverty through their effects on employment. What stands
out clearly from the evidence is the heterogeneity of experiences and outcomes. Moreover, it suggests that economic
growth alone will not necessarily generate employment.
Nor will growth alone reduce poverty. Even in countries
that have achieved successful industrialization, labour market conditions have deteriorated in recent years, reﬂected
by a decline in the quality of employment and by growing
inequality. The cases are discussed below under ﬁve broad
types of development paths: economies that have made the
transition to manufacturing; cases of industrialization with
dualist labour market regimes; cases of service-led growth;
economies in which agriculture dominates; and mineralrich economies.

East Asian states have followed the classic
manufacturing growth path
East Asian states have successfully replicated the classic
industrialization model of the now-developed economies.
They prioritized economic growth and established a strong
state structure to inﬂuence investment decisions and mobilize labour. Starting far behind the technological frontier,
they copied, reﬁned and extended the state-directed strategies of the early industrializers.15 This involved complementary policies in the economic and social ﬁelds. Credit,
investments, entry and exit of ﬁrms in speciﬁc sectors, and
pricing were coordinated to regulate competition and facilitate technological upgrading and industrial restructuring.
They invested heavily in education, training and research,
leading to a deepening of skills across sectors and income

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 1 – TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT-CENTRED STRUCTURAL CHANGE

groups. They had carried out land reform, which raised productivity and income levels in the rural sector. And they
combined selective import substitution and export-led
growth through well-managed industrial policies. They also
imported foreign licences, rather than relying extensively
on foreign direct investment (FDI), and actively mobilized
resources through very high savings rates, which were channelled into long-term investment. They adopted a policy of
life-long employment for (mostly male) workers engaged
in core industries, and created strong links between formal
employment and social protection, which was provided
by private ﬁrms with the state acting as a regulator. This
development strategy generated high rates of growth, low
levels of unemployment and helped the majority of people
to lift themselves out of poverty.

Republic of Korea: Taking a classic route
The Republic of Korea exempliﬁes one of the East Asian
states that followed a classic growth path in which
the share of industrial employment increased. Average
living standards rose dramatically, and poverty fell from
41 per cent of the country’s population in 1965 to less than

8 per cent in 1991.16 However, by the time of the East Asian
ﬁnancial crisis in 1997, the industrial share of employment
had begun to fall and service employment was rising. The
crisis had a dramatic impact on labour markets, fundamentally reshaping employment arrangements and effectively
destroying any guarantee of life-long employment.
Figure 1.4 shows the shares of employment in agriculture,
industry and services for the Republic of Korea from 1980
to 2008. At the start of this period, a process of industrialization was already under way, and industrial employment
stood at 29 per cent of total employment. This share peaked
at 36 per cent in 1991. Services comprised a growing share
of all employment, exceeding 50 per cent by 1993. In 1980,
agriculture still accounted for a third of all employment.
By 2007, its share had dropped to just over 7 per cent.
The share of agricultural output also fell. In the industrial sector, the share of employment increased along with
the share of output during the 1980s, but in the 1990s
both shares declined. However, the share of industrial
employment declined much more rapidly than the share of
industrial output.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

During the phase of rapid industrialization, gains in productivity were associated with growth in industrial employment. By the 1990s, this relationship between industrial
employment and productivity no longer held: output was
no longer growing fast enough to compensate for labour
displacement associated with productivity gains. In the service sector, the share of employment increased faster than
the share of output. Slower productivity growth in services,
in turn, limited the capacity of the economy to achieve
the same rate of improvement in employment earnings for
service workers that was evident in manufacturing employment during the period of rapid industrialization.
Table 1.3 shows the distribution of employment for regular,
temporary and daily employment for the Republic of Korea
in 2005. Both average hours of work and average hourly
earnings are lower in the temporary and daily categories,
implying that the earnings potential (hours worked multi-

38

plied by hourly earnings) for such jobs is signiﬁcantly lower
than in regular employment. Female wage earners are more
likely to work in non-regular jobs than men. Most nonregular employment is concentrated in the service sector
– including retail trade, hotels, restaurants, administrative
support and educational services. In rural areas, agricultural
employment accounts for a signiﬁcant share of non-regular
employment. Construction work comprises an important
share of daily employment, with male workers dominating. After the East Asian ﬁnancial crisis, the number of
temporary and daily employment contracts grew dramatically. It is estimated that non-regular employment grew
from 17 per cent of total employment in 2001 to
29 per cent in 2006.17 This development ruptured the
complementary link between employment and social
protection. As subsequent chapters will show, this led to
social policy reforms aiming to ensure greater inclusion of
those not formally employed.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Other East Asian states: Growth combined
with poverty reduction
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand represent a second group
of East Asian countries that have also followed the path
of manufacturing-led development, although their levels
of skill formation, domestic savings, social protection and
state capacity are much lower than the Republic of Korea,
and foreign capital plays a more signiﬁcant role in their
industrial strategies. In Malaysia, manufacturing employment expanded rapidly – from 7 per cent in the 1960s to
about 28 per cent in 2000. Whereas 55 per cent of Malaysians earned a living from agriculture in the 1960s, this
share fell to 16 per cent by 2000. Poverty fell from about
50 per cent in 1970 to less than 6 per cent in 2004.18
China and Viet Nam constitute a third group: countries
transitioning from centrally planned to market economies.
In both countries, communist governments have facilitated faster growth, with party cadres initially spearheading
reforms and in some cases acting as entrepreneurs, even as
changes in the incentive structure offered more resources,
property rights and decision-making powers to small producers. Rural industrialization constituted an important
part of the development strategy of these countries, at least
in the early stage of decollectivization.19 As transition progressed, their development strategies have come to rely on
high-productivity-driven foreign ﬁrms, which affect the
extent to which employment growth can match labour
force growth. A large proportion of the population is still
employed in agriculture. Nonetheless, poverty has fallen
sharply to less than 10 per cent in China20 and less than
15 per cent in Viet Nam.21

has replaced traditional latifundia (large estates) and is
responsible for an overwhelming share of agricultural output. At the same time, over half of the urban labour force
is self-employed or works as domestic labour or in small
enterprises with low pay. A few other developing countries, such as the Philippines and South Africa, share Latin
America’s pattern of industrialization and dualism (that
is, economies with a formal sector that offers high wages,
beneﬁts, security and prospects for upward mobility; and an
informal sector characterized by low incomes and less job
security, training and mobility).
From 1950 to the 1980s, many of these countries pursued
an import-substitution industrialization strategy, with some
achieving high growth rates and reduced poverty during
part of that period. They were unable, however, to complete the process of industrial transformation, producing
instead labour market and social policy regimes that are
highly dualistic. Long-running economic crises and massive debts in the 1980s exposed most of these countries
to the policy prescriptions of the international ﬁnancial
institutions (IFIs).

The dualism of many middle-income countries
exacerbates inequalities

The skewed nature of income distribution in favour of highincome groups was linked with skill- and capital-intensive
industrialization. In South Africa, where the apartheid
state deliberately discouraged the emergence of an integrated national economy and tried to contain black labour
militancy, many industrial ﬁrms and farm owners opted for
capital-intensive methods by investing in sophisticated
machinery, requiring few skilled technicians and a small
labour force.23 Such a strategy worsened unemployment,
poverty and inequality, which the post-apartheid government has not been able to reverse while pursuing a highproductivity growth strategy.24 Unemployment in South
Africa is about 27 per cent, the highest rate in the world.

Many middle-income countries are highly industrialized. In
per capita terms, Latin America is the most industrialized
region in the developing world.22 On average, agriculture
accounts for less than 10 per cent of national output in
the region, although agribusiness is thriving, especially in
Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Capital-intensive farming

The growth strategies of dualist economies in Latin America
relied heavily on foreign loans and massive importation of
capital goods and technology. These could not be sustained
when the terms of trade for key exports deteriorated and
interest rates skyrocketed. Nor could the export strategy
that later complemented the model of import substitution

40

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 1 – TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT-CENTRED STRUCTURAL CHANGE

generate enough revenues to pay for the accumulated debt
or avert the balance of payments crises of the 1980s.

Brazil: Industrialization without job creation
Despite industrialization, about half of Brazil’s workforce is
informally employed. Table 1.4 presents the average sectoral distribution of employment and output in Brazil. Industrial employment accounted for between 20 and 24 per cent
of total employment over the period 1980–2006. Both the
share of industrial employment and the share of industrial
output declined on average over this period, although there
is some indication of an upturn from 2001–2006. Output
fell faster than industrial employment, suggesting a reduction in average productivity in industrial activities.
Table 1.5 shows that the share of non-agricultural informal
employment is identical to the share of non-agricultural
formal employment – 41 per cent. Employed women are
more likely to work in non-agricultural informal employment than employed men. This is mostly due to the large

number of domestic workers in Brazil, the vast majority of
whom are women (see chapter 4). Earnings are generally
highest in formal employment and lowest in agricultural
employment, and workers in non-agricultural informal
employment earn more, on average, than most agricultural
workers. All categories of informal employment have lower
earnings; and in all categories of employment, women
earn less than men. This is due to a combination of lower
average hourly earnings and fewer hours of paid work each
month. Nevertheless, the hierarchy of earnings, with nonagricultural informal workers earning more than most
agricultural workers, suggests that there will be continued
economic pressures for ongoing rural-to-urban migration,
even if rural migrants have no chance of being employed in
a formal job. Of course, some caution is warranted in drawing conclusions too hastily – these estimates do not take
into account other factors, such as differences in the cost
of living in rural and urban areas. Poverty reduction will be
slower if informal employment expands and wages in these
forms of precarious employment do not improve.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 1 – TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT-CENTRED STRUCTURAL CHANGE

The inability of industrialization to deliver high levels of
formal employment in dualist economies undermines the
complementarity demonstrated in the East Asian cases
between labour market participation and social protection. As subsequent chapters will show, governments that
are keen to improve the welfare of the poor have instead
expanded social assistance schemes, such as cash transfers.
While these schemes have helped to reduce poverty and
inequality, the sharp divisions in labour markets and failure of the growth strategy to generate enough jobs that are
adequately remunerated and protected make it difﬁcult for
the majority of the population to escape from poverty or for
inequality to be substantially reduced.

Can service-led development be an alternative
to industrialization?
Growth in the service sectors of many developing countries
– particularly higher value added services – has raised the
possibility that service-led development could provide an
alternative to the manufacturing-led path.25 Two points are
worth noting. First, services are not necessarily a substitute
for industrialization. Many services contribute to industrial
production that raises average productivity.
Second, there has been strong growth in international
trade in services. If services become increasingly tradable,
then the demand for services need not come from domestic industries or consumers, but could result from industrial
growth elsewhere in the global economy. Whether the
export of services can mimic the success of the export-based
industrialization strategy followed by East Asia remains to
be seen.

Ireland: Bolstering economic growth
through services
In some countries with reasonable levels of industrialization, the service sector can be productive. Ireland, dubbed
the Celtic Tiger, used services to sustain its growth strategy
of the 1990s, which reversed the country’s long period of
economic stagnation and high levels of unemployment. The
service sector’s share of exports doubled from 17 per cent

to 34 per cent between 1998 and 2004, and employment
in services, which grew by about 18 per cent between 2002
and 2006, accounts for 67 per cent of total employment.
The service-led strategy is driven by FDI (with ﬁnancial
services accounting for about 85 per cent of such investment in 2004), and is based on a regime of low taxation.
A series of collective agreements, involving the state,
employers, trade unions and farmers, have been decisive in
holding wages down in exchange for high levels of employment and low income tax rates. However, welfare expenditures have fallen sharply, and poverty levels have shown a
steady rise since 1997, except at the 60 per cent of average
income poverty line where poverty has remained quite stable.26 Concerns have been raised about the enclave nature
of the ﬁnancial services sector and the weakening of productivity growth in the economy as services have come to
dominate. The global economic crisis has had an adverse
impact on Ireland’s growth strategy, fuelling unemployment and industrial unrest.

India: Bypassing industrialization through
growth in services
India’s early development strategy (1950–1980) was based
on import-substitution industrialization and some ﬂirtation
with redistribution to respond to the demands of segments
of the peasantry that the governing party had mobilized in
anti-colonial struggles. However, the ruling party was disproportionately inﬂuenced by landed and business elites,
which the state could not discipline sufﬁciently to deliver
high growth and structural change.27 Even when the focus of
public policy shifted to poverty reduction in the 1960s and
1970s, state intervention took populist forms and contradictory pulls within the party rendered growth problematic and
redistribution ineffective.28 The outcome is a manufacturing sector that failed to reach the heights of the East Asian
countries. Recent changes in the policy regime and the
increasing signiﬁcance of services have led to high growth
rates. It is unclear, however, whether the service sector will
ultimately transform the Indian economy by stimulating the
lagging manufacturing and agricultural sectors.
The employment situation in India and the country’s development path do not ﬁt neatly into traditional categories.

43

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

In its formal industrial sector, India has experienced
jobless growth in which output has expanded, but employment has stagnated or declined. A large share of India’s
population is still employed in agriculture. In contrast
to the performance of the rural economy, a number of
high value added services have taken off in recent years.
Perhaps the best known are tradable services in information and communications technology (ICT). Nevertheless,
the informal, or unorganized, sector continues to account
for much of India’s urban employment. Figure 1.5 provides an overview of the structure of employment in India.
The expansion of industrial output has not led to a
consistent expansion of industrial employment. Indeed,
more recently employment growth has stagnated in the
industrial sector.

The combination of higher growth and the emergence of
the new service sector has generated speculation that India
is pursuing a new economic model, one that bypasses traditional industrialization by embracing new opportunities
made possible by advances in communications and computer technology.29 A number of factors make a service-led
development path a possibility. First, services may have
a positive impact on the productivity of other sectors of
the economy, including the industrial sector. Therefore,
growth in services can potentially support higher productivity and better standards of living. Second, the high value
added services are mostly tradable – for example, information services. Along the classic manufacturing-led development path, growth in domestic industrial production
generated the market for an expanding service sector. In a
globally integrated world, sustained industrial growth need
not precede the expansion of services if those services are
tradable. Third, the scope for technological innovation
and economies of scale may be greater for services than
is often believed. This would allow services to usurp
the role played by industry, at least in part, in the classic
development model.

The lack of complementarity between labour market participation and social protection is particularly marked in
India and other service-based and agrarian economies. In
the case of India, 90 per cent of the working population
belongs to the informal sector, and therefore lacks adequate
coverage by social protection programmes.

44

Conceptualizing a service-led growth path for India raises
a number of thorny issues. A recent analysis of the drivers
of growth in India suggests that manufacturing and ﬁnance
have been the two most important sectors;30 ICTs do not
yet feature prominently. From an employment perspective, this pattern of growth is worrying. Despite remarkable
increases, employment in the ICT sector remains relatively small if compared to overall service employment in
India. Also, individuals must have sufﬁcient skills to take
advantage of employment opportunities in the ICT sector.
Displaced workers from the industrial sector may be able
to move into these jobs. However, it is unlikely, at least in

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 1 – TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT-CENTRED STRUCTURAL CHANGE

the short and medium term, that rural-to-urban migrants
or workers in the informal economy will enjoy sufﬁcient
upward labour market mobility to take up ICT jobs – limiting the extent to which service-led development can
reduce poverty.
Finally, service-led development that relies on the promotion of tradable services will almost certainly lead to
growing inequalities among workers in service activities.
Tradable services will enjoy higher returns to labour and
improved opportunities, while non-tradable services (those
tied closely to the domestic market, including a large share
of urban informal employment) may not realize equivalent
advantages. Poor workers are more likely to be concentrated
in non-tradable services, suggesting that these individuals
and their families may be left behind under a service-led
growth paradigm.
India’s development model suffers another constraint.
Annual agricultural growth in the post-liberalization period
has averaged nearly 1 per cent below that achieved in the
1980s, largely due to a decline in public investment during that period.31 Sustained levels of growth have reduced
poverty in aggregate terms. According to ofﬁcial statistics,32
income poverty began to decline from about 50 per cent
of the population in 1977–1978 to about 27 per cent in
2004–2005. But the rate of decline is estimated to have
been faster in the 1980s, compared to the 1990s and beyond,
suggesting that poverty reduction suffered a setback after the
initiation of neoliberal reforms. And although rural-urban per
capita incomes narrowed in the 1980s, they widened again
in the 1990s, and there is limited progress in many physical
indicators of well-being and deprivation. Nutrition poverty
remains high at about 75 per cent.33 Other indicators, such as
child mortality or height-to-weight ratios of children, are poor
in absolute terms, despite the increase in output growth.34

Low-income countries remain heavily agrarian
Many low-income countries are experiencing a different type of transformation. Their state-led strategies of
industrialization produced high growth, savings and

investment rates in the 1960s and 1970s, even though
they tended to have high capital-output ratios, suggesting
less efﬁcient use of capital.35 By the early 1980s, the majority
of these countries were in crisis and were forced by the IFIs
to adopt deﬂationary and liberalization policies. In many
cases, this led to a distinct process of de-industrialization
and a hollowing out of the state. Their economies
have remained heavily agrarian, with a large informal
sector and less diversiﬁed and more limited industrial and
export sectors.36

Kenya and Cambodia: Predominantly agricultural
Kenya and Cambodia represent two countries in which
agricultural output is still a very high share of GDP and
agricultural employment dominates. In addition, both
countries have a ﬂedgling industrial base and have enjoyed
some success in recent years in penetrating new export
markets – Kenya in horticultural products and Cambodia
in garments. The success of these export sectors remains
precarious, and it is unclear whether they will provide an
adequate foundation, by themselves, for future industrialization and employment generation.
The vast majority of employment in Kenya is characterized by agricultural activities, on the one hand, and a service economy with a high rate of informalization, on the
other. Agricultural employment accounts for 62 per cent of
total employment (see table 1.6). Smallholders and family
members working on small farms and family plots constitute
the vast majority of agricultural jobs. Informal self-employment (including own-account or self-employed workers,
employers and contributing family workers) constitutes an
important source of employment outside of agriculture –
both as a primary occupation and a supplementary source
of income. Overall, services dominate non-agricultural
employment, with 79.5 per cent of all employment outside of agriculture in the service sector, and 80 per cent
of all informal household enterprises providing service
activities.37 Kenya’s formal, non-agricultural sector is quite
small, accounting for about 11 per cent of total employment, including public sector jobs. Only 9.2 per cent
of non-agricultural employment is in manufacturing;
6.4 per cent is in construction.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 1 – TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT-CENTRED STRUCTURAL CHANGE

The structure of employment in Cambodia is similar to
that in Kenya, with agriculture and services dominating.
Agriculture accounts for 59 per cent of total employment
and, like Kenya, is comprised mostly of own-account and
contributing family workers (see table 1.7). Private sector wage employment comprises just 13 per cent of all
employment. Outside of agriculture, self-employment (as
own-account or contributing family workers) is the largest

category of employment. Manufacturing employment is
relatively small and the garment sector is responsible for
over half of all opportunities in manufacturing. Services
account for roughly a quarter of all employment (or 61 per
cent of non-agricultural employment). Like Kenya, efforts
to reduce poverty through employment, based on the existing structure of employment alone, should thus focus on
raising the returns to labour in agriculture and services.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

In agrarian economies,
efforts to reduce poverty through
employment should focus on
raising the returns to labour in
agriculture and services
In Kenya, the recent growth of the horticultural sector provides an interesting example of how export performance
may be linked to employment creation and poverty reduction. The employment effects of the rapid expansion of horticulture include increases in smallholder farm production
and in the number of workers on large commercial operations. The primary products of the sector are fresh fruits,
vegetables and cut ﬂowers. Fresh vegetables and fruits are
linked to smallholders, while the production of cut ﬂowers
is organized by larger commercial enterprises. In terms of
wage employment, which is concentrated in cut ﬂowers,
60 to 70 per cent of workers are women and most are young
– half the workforce is under 21. Initially, employment in
the horticultural sector appeared to reduce poverty and
raise living standards among households, when compared
to those households that were not involved in the sector.
The effect was particularly strong in rural areas.38 However,
enforcement of international food standards has reduced
the participation of smallholders, whose contribution
to export earnings fell from 70 per cent in 1999 to only
30 per cent by 2000.39 It should also be noted that many
of the jobs generated are casual and seasonal, and income
is volatile.40
In Cambodia, the dynamic export sector is the garment
industry. Representing less than 1 per cent of GDP in 1994,
the industry has now grown to 16–17 per cent of GDP and
nearly 80 per cent of exports. Women account for an estimated 81 per cent of all wage employment in the garment
sector. However, only 31 per cent of all women who work as
wage employees have jobs in this sector.41 Similarly, while
women represent half of all employed individuals in Cambodia, they make up only 42 per cent of all wage employees.
Individuals from provinces with higher-than-average inci-

48

dences of poverty migrate to work in the garment sector.42
An estimated 71 per cent of all garment workers remit 30
per cent or more of their earnings back to their households
of origin.43 Some garment ﬁrms are joint ventures with
Cambodian investors, but most ﬁrms are entirely foreignowned.44 This lack of domestic embeddedness makes production more mobile and sensitive to policy changes.
These examples from Kenya and Cambodia underscore the
difﬁculty of building a base of new, outward-oriented economic activities in low-income economies dominated by
agriculture. Both horticultural products and garments are
labour-intensive exports, subject to competitive pressures.
External factors – such as the global economic crisis – have
a profound impact on the markets for these products and,
ultimately, employment in these sectors. Recent growth
accelerations in many agrarian and other economies were
linked to the boom in commodity prices and the growth of
the world economy in the period 2000–2007. This growth
led to some reduction in poverty. However, the economic
and food crises have exposed the fragility of that growth.
Key indicators of well-being, such as nutrition, are still very
poor,45 and may even have worsened as a result of agricultural liberalization that promoted agro-exports. A large
number of people still live insecure lives even though, by
$1.25-a-day measures, they are above the poverty line.
Many move in and out of poverty depending on prevailing conditions and replace more nutritious and costly foods
with cheaper alternatives in order to reduce their daily
expenses.46 The need to enhance the livelihoods of small
farmers in combating poverty in agrarian economies has
been thrown into sharp relief by the food crisis. The next
two sections examine these issues before discussing labour
market and employment issues in mineral-rich economies.

Recent growth in many agrarian
economies was linked to the boom
in commodity prices, but the economic
and food crises have exposed the
fragility of that growth

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 1 – TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT-CENTRED STRUCTURAL CHANGE

Promoting employment and food security
through support to small farmers
The food crisis can be traced to the liberalization policies
of the 1980s and 1990s. In the global South, spending on
farming as a share of public expenditures fell 50 per cent
between 1980 and 2004, from $7.6 billion to $3.9 billion.
By way of comparison, in 2006, farmers in countries that
are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) received $130 billion in
direct payments in 2006.47
In Latin America, economic liberalization reforms of the
1980s and 1990s tended to reinforce existing divisions
between geographic locations and producers, and the
region entered the new millennium with a higher proportion of poor and indigent rural dwellers than in 1980. The
most dynamic products of the 1990s were those grown by
modern, capitalized farmers with links to international
agro-industry and export markets. Those in decline were
largely produced by small farmers.48 One of the real costs
of liberalization in Latin America has been the rise in agricultural imports.
The rural effects of liberalization policies have been more
profound among agriculturally dependent populations
in sub-Saharan Africa. Compared to other developing
regions, agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa had been a sluggish earner before liberalization, though not uniformly so.
State bodies, such as marketing boards, were perceived as
a costly drain on government revenue and inefﬁcient in
delivering inputs and paying farmers.
The reduction of state involvement was supposed to reverse
the situation. From 1989 to 2004, the national budget
share of agriculture in the region fell from 7 per cent to
5.3 per cent.49 Larger scale commercial farmers and estate
owners have been in a better position to take advantage
of improved prices and new markets than smallholders.
In several countries and for particular commodities, liberalization did produce spurts in smallholder production of
export crops, but these gains have not been maintained.50

As liberalization progressed, sub-Saharan Africa witnessed
a steady decline of its agricultural exports as a share of
world agricultural trade. Meanwhile, the problems surrounding food production and food security worsened. The
2002 shortages in southern Africa showed the increasingly
perilous state of rural livelihoods. Deteriorating household
food security in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe was attributed to the loss of subsidies for fertilizers and seeds and of
rural credit, and the erosion of agricultural marketing services, especially in remote areas. Although much derided,
marketing boards serviced the need of smallholders for
inputs, provided marketing channels to remote and widely
dispersed farms, and enforced commodity standards. Their
dismantling has led to serious concern on the part of many
observers. The private traders that have taken their place
provide patchy services, bypass farmers in areas where transport costs are high, and do not carry out adequate checks or
enforce quality control.51

Expelling smallholders to urban
fringes of economic systems
characterized by jobless growth
cannot be called development
There is a tendency to dismiss smallholder production
for local markets as obsolete,52 especially as the pace of
de-peasantization (peasant displacement from land and
reliance on off-farm income) accelerates. De-peasantization is, however, the outcome of a politically organized
food regime premised on increased privileges for corporate
over peasant agriculture, as institutionalized in the subsidy structure of the World Trade Organization/Free Trade
Area/Economic Partnership Agreement (WTO/FTA/EPA).
In spite of market discrimination, small producers have
an important social and ecological role (and many small
producers would like to support them, as evidenced by
recent mobilization in the transnational food sovereignty
movements). Expelling smallholders to urban fringes of
economic systems characterized by jobless growth cannot
be called development.

49

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

An alternative agricultural model
Current development policy seeks to incorporate small
farmers into what the World Bank calls a “new agriculture”,
which is “led by private entrepreneurs in extensive value
chains linking producers to consumers”.53 The expectation
is that the private sector will drive “the organization of value
chains that bring the market to smallholders and commercial farms”.54 In this view, the problem of smallholder agriculture (or rural poverty) is a problem of productivity and
detachment from value-chain agriculture, through which
farmers gain technologies to intensify their production of
certain commodities for consumer markets. Such a view is
fraught with problems from the perspective of social development and poverty reduction. There is often a trade-off
between own consumption, production for local markets
and production for global markets, with respect to addressing the problem of poverty and hunger in rural areas.55
Neoclassical economics regards trade as the catalyst of
growth, and certainly that has been the path taken historically. But trade does not always guarantee improvements in
welfare, as is clearly evident today. Moreover, given the current catastrophe of slum proliferation, where industrialization
and urbanization have been decoupled,56 the question arises
as to whether continued displacement of rural populations
by intensive production of industrial grains (for example,
feed crops versus food crops) and high-value foods for export
is an appropriate vision for agricultural development. The
premise that export agriculture is an economic necessity is
perhaps the most questionable assumption from the perspective of social welfare, food rights and a sustainable environment. In a world of drastically shrinking limits, where it is
urgent to curb unnecessary consumption and phase out fossil
fuels, improving agricultural productivity to fuel the international food trade is arguably less important than improving
agricultural productivity and the security of farming to provide local populations with enough and appropriate foods.
An alternative approach is preﬁgured in the work of the UN–
sponsored International Assessment of Agricultural Science and
Technology for Development in 2008. This report advocates
a multifunctional role for agriculture in reducing poverty
and social and gender inequality, stabilizing the cultures of

50

rural populations, and reversing environmental degradation
and global warming. The report recommends strengthening
local and regional food systems, democratizing food policy,
and prioritizing the needs of small farmers by securing access
to productive resources (seeds, land, water), credit, information, market infrastructure and fair trade systems. The report
questions industrial agriculture and genetically modiﬁed
food as the solution to the social and ecological crises associated with global agribusiness, on the grounds that markets
fail to adequately value environmental and social harm. It
also questions the salience of a market-driven approach, and
its narrow focus on productivity, versus an integrative view
of food, resource and nutritional security. Such an approach
to food security that places the livelihoods of small producers at the centre of public policy could reduce vulnerability
and should be seen as a crucial dimension of social policy in
agrarian economies.

Without careful management, mineral wealth
can be a mixed blessing
In many mineral-rich economies, structural transformation
has involved a movement from agriculture to mining, or
a change that is largely conﬁned to the primary sector. In
these economies, the mining sector dominates output but
does not create enough jobs to lift the population out of
poverty. The dominant actors are often transnational ﬁrms
that use capital-intensive technologies, providing employment to a small, well-paid, skilled workforce. Governments
can reallocate mineral rents to more productive sectors or
act as channels through which such rents can be reinvested
in the rest of the economy.
However, many countries have not used mineral rents to
support development in sectors that can create more jobs.
Manufacturing capacity remains extremely low even in
the high-income economies of the Gulf states. Natural
resource abundance may generate distortions in countries’ economic and political systems, leading to “Dutch
disease”57 (discussed further in chapter 8). Dutch disease
(or the “resource curse”) refers to patterns of consumption
and investment in boom periods (associated with dramatic

Botswana represents a country that has managed its mineral
wealth much better than most mineral-rich developing countries. Its development strategy prioritizes high growth, sound
macroeconomic management and infrastructure development. Through policies that discourage exchange rate overvaluation, ﬁscal strategies that set targets on government
spending, and the creation of special funds that stabilize
mineral revenues, the government has consistently maintained a stable macroeconomy that has avoided the so-called
resource curse.58 Multiparty democracy, although practised
under conditions of single-party dominance, has acted as a
check on governmental arbitrariness, and a professionalized
civil service has helped the state enforce its rules on economic management. The governing elite forged strong links
to production-oriented cattle owners and successfully constructed pacts with traditional rulers and elites of key ethnic
groups59 that have allowed it to maintain stability.

Many mineral-rich economies
have not used mineral rents to
support development in sectors
that can create more jobs

However, success in governing the economy has not translated into broad-based and diversiﬁed growth. The share
of agriculture in GDP has fallen drastically since 1960 (see
ﬁgure 1.6), even though per worker output in agriculture has
not increased. The diversiﬁcation of the economy into manufacturing was not seriously attempted, and was deﬁnitely
not achieved, since the share of manufacturing in GDP has
declined as well. Nor have organized interests in civil society
been strong enough to compel the state to adopt more redistributive policies.60 While the share of public sector salaries
rose, the minimum wages of less skilled/moderately educated
employees fell below the poverty line by the 1980s, producing a class of working poor. A notable feature of Botswana’s
development is its relatively low level of industrialization
and, like South Africa, high level of unemployment. Levels
of unemployment, inequality (as measured by the Gini coefﬁcient) and poverty remain high at about 20 per cent, 0.57 and
30 per cent, respectively.61 Mineral-rich Indonesia and Malaysia, which are among the top 10 developing-country exporters
of manufactured products, have fared much better in transforming their economies from minerals to manufacturing.62

sustainable during periods of economic downturn. Exchange
rates and wage rates appreciate, affecting tradable activities in manufacturing and agriculture. The outcome may
be an enclave economy, such as in Equatorial Guinea, that
generates extreme inequality and poverty even in contexts
of high growth. Mineral resources create opportunities for
corruption and pressures for redistribution in ways that do
not enhance public welfare and development. Features of
Dutch disease are likely to emerge in situations where the
institutions that regulate the mineral sector and manage
ﬁscal revenues are not well developed, and where state
power is monopolized by rent-seeking rulers or is captured
by powerful private interests.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

4. The Links between
Employment and Poverty
The foregoing discussion on employment and labour markets is broadened out in the following section to explore
the links between employment and poverty. Two sets of
institutions are critical in shaping the employment-poverty
nexus: the labour market and the household. Employment
status is typically deﬁned and analysed at the level of the
individual or the job. Poverty – income poverty in particular – is most commonly deﬁned and measured at the level
of the household. Therefore, the structure of the household
– in terms of the composition of dependants and earners
– will directly inﬂuence how employment opportunities
translate into changes in poverty outcomes.
Overall labour force participation is determined by prevailing economic conditions, as well as the social and cultural
context, in particular gender norms. Households often
respond to adverse economic shocks – including rising
unemployment – by increasing their rate of labour force
participation. Studies of labour market dynamics in Latin
America have shown that women’s labour force participation increased in times of economic crisis and as a result
of policies that trigger labour displacement, job instability
and higher rates of unemployment.63 Economic changes
that cause women to enter the labour force are also associated with a deterioration in the average quality of employment opportunities, that is, greater reliance on informal
or precarious forms of paid work. Households also increase
their labour force participation in response to long-term
structural unemployment. For instance, research in South
Africa has shown that women’s labour force participation has responded to increases in household joblessness.64
Finally, household poverty also raises the likelihood that
children enter the paid labour force.
Therefore, the relationship between poverty and employment runs in both directions: poverty can increase
total household employment, often in more marginal
activities, and particularly among women and children. However, it is also important to recognize that the

52

additional employment income earned in this way will
be combined with other sources of household income,
ultimately inﬂuencing the depth and incidence of poverty.
The links between employment and poverty depend critically on how the employed and the economically dependent populations are organized in households. If the burden
of supporting the dependent population is unequally distributed, the result will be higher risks of poverty for certain segments of the population. Moreover, not only does
income from employment need to support a larger number
of people in households with more dependants, but choices
in terms of employment are also limited in these households, due to the higher burdens of unpaid care work
(see chapter 7).

The working poor poverty rate
is one indication of how employment
affects poverty
To shed light on the link between employment and poverty,
this report deﬁnes a working poor poverty rate. The working
poor are deﬁned as those individuals who are (i) employed
and (ii) living in households whose income or consumption levels fall below a poverty threshold. The working poor
poverty rate is the number of working poor in a particular
employment category expressed as a percentage of the total
number of people in the same employment category. This
indicates the likelihood that workers in particular types of
employment will live in income- or consumption-poverty.
Working poor poverty rates are derived from national
poverty lines, which vary across countries; some countries
use consumption data whereas others use income data.
Since cross-country data on working poor poverty rates do
not currently exist, this report uses two countries – Brazil
and Kenya – to illustrate the relationship (see table 1.8).
National poverty lines in Brazil and Kenya are determined
differently. In Brazil it is based on income – whether or not
a household’s income falls below the poverty line. In Kenya
it is based on total household consumption. Therefore,
we can compare the relative risk of being in poverty among
employment categories in these two countries, but poverty
rates are not directly comparable.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

In both countries, working poor poverty rates tend to be
higher in agricultural versus non-agricultural employment,
and in informal versus formal employment. Poverty rates
for self-employed workers in the formal sector and outside
of agriculture are lowest, on average. In Brazil, self-employment in the informal sector has a lower poverty risk than
informal wage employment. In Kenya, this same pattern
holds true for men, but not for women. Overall, the highest
risk of poverty is associated with agricultural employment.
In Brazil, agricultural self-employment has lower poverty rates on average than agricultural wage employment.
In Kenya, this pattern holds true only for women.
The bottom part of table 1.8 presents working poor poverty
rates per sector of economic activity. Again we see the same
patterns. Informal employment has much higher poverty
rates than formal employment and agricultural employment
exhibits the highest poverty risk. The interesting comparison
is between service employment and manufacturing employment. For formal employment, jobs in services are associated
with a lower risk of poverty than jobs in manufacturing – this
holds true for men as well as women in both countries. For
informal employment, the same holds true (the one exception being women in Brazil, in which informal manufacturing has slightly lower poverty rates than informal services
– but this may be explained by the large number of domestic
workers in that country). These results emphasize the importance of having policies to support employment in services
when devising poverty reduction strategies.
Of course, creating more formal jobs and fewer informal jobs
would also have a signiﬁcant impact on average poverty rates.
The rate of informalization is higher in services than in manufacturing. Therefore, poverty rates for a typical manufacturing job may indeed be lower than poverty rates for a typical
service job, since the latter is more likely to be unregulated,
precarious and lacking basic protections. In the case study of
the Republic of Korea, a similar pattern holds true for nonregular employment. Much of the growth in non-regular work
in that country occurred in services and construction. Nevertheless, a real challenge is improving the quality of service
and agricultural employment, instead of pursuing a single
objective of increasing industrial employment.

54

5. Putting Employment Back
on the Agenda: Implications
for Policy
Economic policies to promote growth and development will
only reduce poverty and inequality if the beneﬁts of growth
are widely shared. Employment represents a major channel
through which additional income generated by faster growth
can be distributed throughout the population. The issue of
employment, therefore, must be reintroduced more forcefully
in policy formulation. In doing so, some conventional wisdom must be upturned. It is often thought, for example, that
jobs are a by-product of economic growth. Even the MDGs
did not initially include employment goals. Likewise, inadequate employment opportunities are often seen as exclusively
a labour market problem, with the most common prescription
being increased ﬂexibility achieved by rolling back regulations
and social protections. Major categories of employment are
sidelined or ignored altogether – speciﬁcally, employment in
the informal economy. When these activities are recognized,
policies often focus on promoting entrepreneurship instead of
addressing the conditions under which labour is exchanged.
This concluding section presents some key elements of a
framework for incorporating employment more centrally in
the formulation of development policy. Given the variations in employment structures, there can be no one-sizeﬁts-all employment policy. However, because employment
structures are the outcome of processes of development and
change, public policy should also focus on their transformation so as to create a stronger foundation for the universal
provision of decent work opportunities.

Improve employment opportunities
Addressing labour demand, quality and mobility
Even if the structure of employment is taken as given,
employment opportunities can be improved by addressing
three key areas.
• First, policies must tackle insufﬁcient labour demand.
Many countries experience widespread unemployment

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 1 – TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT-CENTRED STRUCTURAL CHANGE

and/or underemployment, both of which have a
common root cause: insufﬁcient labour demand,
which results from the demand for goods and services.
Economic policies must seek to stimulate an adequate
level of labour demand that will enable the majority of
the population to move out of poverty.
• Second, the policy framework should support
improvements in the quality of existing employment,
which is often constrained by low productivity and/
or the inability of workers to capture the beneﬁts of
productivity improvements. Improving the quality
of employment involves raising productivity and
improving wage levels, social protection and conditions
of work. Balancing the need for increases in both
productivity and employment, especially in economies
with high levels of structural unemployment, is a big
challenge.65 However, productivity growth can support
employment expansion if the rate of capital formation
or accumulation is high, as demonstrated by Japan in
the 1960s and early 1970s, and in the Republic of Korea
during its period of high growth and industrialization.66
• Third, workers must be agile enough to change jobs
and move into other industries. Barriers to labour and
economic mobility limit the redistributive impact
of an employment-centred development strategy.
A range of interventions – removing restrictions on the
movement of labour, improving access to education and
skills upgrading, providing basic ﬁnancial services and
reducing imbalances in the burden of unpaid work, for
example – are instrumental in improving the mobility
and economic status of workers.

Identifying and addressing the most
signiﬁcant constraints
A ﬁrst step in improving employment opportunities is identifying the most signiﬁcant constraints, which vary widely
from country to country. This requires an understanding of
the structure of employment and the associated economic
and institutional context. Each of the ﬁve types of economies
discussed in this chapter exhibits distinct characteristics and
therefore will have different policy priorities. For example,
the countries characterized by relatively high levels of agri-

cultural self-employment, such as Cambodia and Kenya, face
different constraints to improving those jobs than countries
with a large, urbanized workforce in wage employment. Policies to improve conditions for the poorest workers require
knowledge of the employment arrangements in which individuals from low-income households work.
Macroeconomic policy is essential for addressing certain constraints to improving employment. For example, restrictive
monetary policies that target low inﬂation rates reduce
the growth of domestic demand. One frequent outcome
of such policies is high real interest rates.67 In some countries, high real interest rates have attracted short-term
capital inﬂows, leading to an over-appreciated exchange
rate and a heightened risk of volatile capital outﬂows.
Therefore, an alternative monetary policy framework is
essential for expanding domestic markets, maintaining a
competitive exchange rate, and improving access to credit
on affordable terms. Similarly, ﬁscal policies need to be
reoriented to support greater public investment. Such
investment is often essential for improving productivity
and ensuring market access (for example, through new
roads and better transportation).
Macroeconomic management represents only part of
the policy toolkit. Selective industrial and agricultural
policies and institutional reforms are also necessary. For
example, limited access to credit may be primarily a result
of the institutional structure of the ﬁnancial sector. A more
relaxed monetary stance may not make a signiﬁcant difference in the absence of reforms that channel credit to
activities that are currently shut out of formal ﬁnancial
institutions. Improved productivity may depend on very
speciﬁc categories of infrastructure investment (for example, electriﬁcation schemes for residential areas to enhance
the productivity of home-based workers). Given growing
urbanization, innovative urban policies are also essential
to support the livelihoods of low-income workers. Finally,
there must be policies that focus on support for smallholders in order to feed rural families and the general population, improve rural productivity and incomes, and connect
the agricultural sector more productively to other sectors of
the economy.

55

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Transform the structure of employment to
make sustained inroads against poverty
Improving employment opportunities by taking the existing structure of employment as given is likely to be inadequate. The process of economic development involves the
transformation of the structure of employment – not simply
improving opportunities in existing activities. The longterm challenge is to move human resources into higher
value added activities, raise the average level of labour productivity, and thereby increase wages and people’s incomes.
The classic development trajectory involved the growth of
industrial employment and a movement out of agriculture,
facilitated by improvements in agricultural productivity and an increase in farm incomes. As this chapter has
shown, in an open-economy setting with a high degree
of global integration, this pathway may not be the only
option. Nevertheless, the basic tenets remain valid: reallocating labour to more productive activities, smoothing
the transitions between sectors, and helping lagging sectors
keep up with the process of structural change will contribute to economic growth and development.68

Reallocating labour to more productive
activities, smoothing the transitions
between sectors, and helping lagging
sectors keep up with the process of
structural change will contribute to
economic growth
Macroeconomic policy, the investment climate
and investment in infrastructure
In transforming the structure of paid employment, the macroeconomic environment plays a crucial supporting role.
New investment is needed for the transformation of productive activities. Macroeconomic policies can facilitate
raising productive investment by maintaining a favourable
investment climate.69 The elements of such an investment
climate include the maintenance of low and positive real

56

interest rates, strong growth in demand (which may include
a competitive real exchange rate) and low levels of volatility (which can be achieved, for example, by managing the
destabilizing effects of short-term capital ﬂows). Controls
on the international mobility of ﬁnancial capital may need
to be put in place to realize these policy objectives.70
An appropriate policy framework can also ensure that natural resources are used to improve employment outcomes.
If the resources from commodity exports are used to fund
strategic investment, instead of general consumption, the
bias against tradable or export sectors can be minimized.
Appropriate infrastructure investments can improve competitiveness and productivity, and help ensure that productive resources are allocated to activities with the potential
to create decent employment opportunities.71 Managed
exchange rates, instead of market-determined ones, can
also help counter the problem of real exchange rate appreciation during commodity booms.

Structural transformation needs strategic
policy interventions
Most of the developed countries and the newly industrialized countries of East Asia used industrial and agricultural
policies to facilitate the structural transformations associated with their varied processes of industrialization. The
precise policy mix differs across countries, but they shared a
number of common features:
• government-directed investment in infrastructure;
• development ﬁnance to channel credit to speciﬁc
productive activities;
• well-managed industrial and agricultural policies,
such as subsidies and tax credits, extension services
and redistributive land reform;
• the pursuit of dynamic competitive advantage by
nurturing the development of strategic industries and
activities; and
• social policies to improve the skill levels and welfare
of the population, such as investments in education,
training and research.
Similar kinds of interventions can be used in many countries today to transform the structure of employment and

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 1 – TOWARDS EMPLOYMENT-CENTRED STRUCTURAL CHANGE

encourage the development, in the longer term, of a solid
foundation of decent work opportunities. Given the constraints of climate change, such interventions should also
be low carbon-intensive and may require international
agreements that support ﬁnancial and technology transfers
to developing countries.72
The employment-centred interventionist policies that
successfully reduced poverty in the past are incompatible
with the neoliberal development strategies adopted by most
countries in recent decades. Certainly, markets provide
critical information about global consumption patterns
and trends, the relative scarcity of inputs, and the distribution of productive resources. Such information is necessary, but not sufﬁcient, to determine the optimal policy
mix and allocation of labour to support sustained growth.
Markets are often inadequate in meeting large and complex challenges that require urgent action, as demonstrated
by the global economic crisis. A combination of non-market interventions and the use of market-generated information is necessary to achieve an employment-friendly
development path.

The employment-centred policies that
successfully eradicated poverty in the
past are incompatible with neoliberal
development strategies more recently
adopted by most countries
Industrialization is important but is not the only viable
path out of poverty. The case studies on Brazil and Kenya
show that in some countries, service employment, including informal services, may be associated with lower risks
of poverty than other forms of employment. Services are
also an important source of paid employment for women.
However, some caution is warranted before pursuing a
service-led strategy. As the case of the Republic of Korea
shows, service jobs appear to have a greater propensity to
be part-time, temporary and more precarious in a number
of respects in recent years. In the case of Kenya, services

have dominated informal employment. If service-led
development simply means an expansion of these forms of
employment, it will not lead to sustained improvements in
living standards. In addition, lumping all services together
obscures important differences. The service-led strategy in
India has focused on employment in ICTs, but these jobs
represent only a small fraction of service employment in
the country. The challenge is to better understand the role
of services in supporting economic development that leads
to higher quality, and more stable, livelihoods over time.
For countries with high levels of agricultural employment,
it is clear that progress cannot be made without improving the productivity, incomes and well-being of smallholders, whose livelihoods depend on agriculture and who can
provide a strong foundation for food security in most poor
countries today.

Extending labour laws, and social protections and
regulations, to all forms of employment
Typically, employment and labour market policies apply
only to formal and not to informal employment, which may
be exposed to higher poverty risks. Therefore, part of the
transformation of the structure of employment involves the
extension of labour law, social protections and regulations
to all forms of employment. In some cases, these institutional changes may be as important as the redistribution
of labour across economic sectors in improving the average quality of employment and managing risk in a way that
safeguards people’s welfare.
Finally, despite the potential for an employment-centred
development policy to reduce poverty and support human
development, it is not enough. Full employment in the strict
sense of the term is not possible in market-based economies, and individuals may wish to exit employment to pursue other activities (such as education, care or community
organizing). Moreover, not all segments of the population
can, or necessarily should, participate in paid employment,
such as those with severe disabilities, the sick, children and
the frail. These caveats do not diminish the importance of
employment as a foundation for inclusive development.
However, as Section two of this report will show, complementary social policies are also necessary.

Income Inequality and
Structural Change
Inequality is considered by some to be of little social concern. As long as poverty is minimized, it is argued, there
should be no principled objection to the unbridled gains of
the very rich. In some hands, this argument becomes one of
active advocacy: that the concentration of wealth should
be cultivated to generate savings, investment and growth.1
Yet the fact that high levels of inequality are often found
in the poorest countries exposes the weakness of this argument. Evidence suggests, in fact, a two-way causal relationship between poverty and inequality. There are additional
important grounds for a concern with inequality. The international human rights framework commits governments to
uphold equality in civil and political rights and to take steps
progressively to achieve this. Furthermore, some notion of
equity is central to the construction of socially inclusive
states and the realization of substantive citizenship.2

High levels of inequality are often found
in the poorest countries, and evidence
suggests a two-way causal relationship
between poverty and inequality

Easing inequality has, however, been marginal to the poverty reduction agenda of the international development
community in recent years. Apart from a commitment to
eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) do
not explicitly focus on inequalities, despite the afﬁrmation
of the principles of equality laid out in the Millennium Declaration. More recently, several reports3 have underscored
the intrinsic value of equality as well as its relevance for
achieving growth and reducing poverty. But the view articulated in the World Bank’s World Development Report 2006

2

emphasizes equality of opportunities as opposed to outcomes.
This argument justiﬁes unequal outcomes if the processes
that generate them are “fair”,4 and advocates interventions
only to protect those who fall below an absolute threshold of need. Such a view results in a weak redistributive
agenda that shies away from any serious consideration of
wealth and income redistribution now, emphasizing instead
investments in opportunities that might produce a more
equitable future.5
This chapter examines the causes, patterns and dynamics of inequality, with a particular focus on inequalities of
income and wealth, often referred to as vertical inequalities. Inequalities among groups (horizontal inequalities) or
based on factors that determine identity, such as ethnicity
and gender, will be dealt with in chapters 3 and 4. In this
and subsequent chapters, emphasis is placed on both the
intrinsic and instrumental value of redistributive policies and
processes that lead to equitable outcomes.
Based on extensive analysis of country case studies, the
chapter demonstrates that increases in inequality are
linked to a range of economic policies that have dominated
the development agenda in recent decades. These include
ﬁnancial liberalization, regressive taxation, privatization in
the context of weak regulation, public expenditure policies that fail to protect the poor during crisis or adjustment
periods, and labour market policies that lead to precarious
forms of ﬂexibility, informalization and an erosion of minimum wages and union bargaining power.6 Other causes of
rising inequality include disparities in educational attainment, technological change and employment policies that
widen wage gaps between skilled and unskilled workers;
rural-urban wage differentials in the process of structural
change; inequality in asset ownership (including land);
and unequal access to credit and basic production inputs,
particularly in the agricultural sector.

59

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Increases in inequality are linked to
a range of economic policies that
have dominated the development
agenda in recent decades
Chapter 1 has argued that the overall structure of employment, and the distribution of employment across sectors,
has signiﬁcant implications for the well-being of a population and for poverty reduction. Continuing this line of reasoning, this chapter discusses the importance of structural
change, changing global intersectoral terms of trade and
macroeconomic policies for the evolution of inequality.
It argues that despite the importance of structural change
in determining levels of inequality, there is no single pattern that holds for all countries across time. Instead, as the
case studies illustrate, (i) redistributive policies can moderate inequalities even at early stages of industrialization,
and (ii) rapidly industrializing economies with a previously egalitarian income distribution may experience rising
inequalities in the absence of corrective measures. Furthermore, (iii) most low-income agrarian societies that have
not yet experienced sustained growth and industrialization,
and whose public policies lack a redistributive focus, generally have high levels of inequality; and (iv) the growing
dominance of the ﬁnancial and technological sectors in
national economies, especially in contexts where economic
policies favour market liberalization and less redistribution,
increases inequality.
This chapter also shows that structural change – in terms
of the changing roles of agriculture, industry and services
in an economy – and the global terms of trade among these
sectors are closely related. In the short run, global terms
of trade have a direct effect on inequality in a liberalized
economy. For instance, a fall in global commodity prices
tends to drive up inequality in agrarian economies by lowering the relative incomes of commodity producers. A technology bubble raises incomes at the top. High interest rates
are, in general, bad for debtors and good for creditors; they
thus raise inequality since the latter are almost invariably
richer than the former. This underscores the importance of

60

global governance of ﬁnancial and commodity markets and
the management of global monetary policy.
Reducing inequality has value in its own right, and
also yields substantial beneﬁts in terms of both poverty
reduction and growth. There are a number of mutually
supportive redistributive policies that governments can
adopt, including:
• land reform, especially in highly unequal economies
where the poor depend substantially on land for
their livelihoods;
• ﬁscal reforms that improve tax administration,
prevent tax evasion and avoidance, and limit
opposition to progressive taxation and redistribution
(see also chapters 8 and 10);
• income-generating employment opportunities
(as discussed in chapter 1); and
• expenditure-related policies that enhance the welfare
of the poor (such as the range of social policies
discussed in Section two of this report).

Reducing inequality has value in
its own right and also yields beneﬁts
in terms of both poverty reduction
and growth
In sum, four key messages are highlighted in this chapter.
• Income inequality is on the rise, partly as a result
of neoliberal economic policies adopted in the 1980s
and 1990s.
• Growth and equity can be mutually reinforcing,
but only when supported by well-thought-out economic
and social policies. Such policies should pay particular
attention to the needs of small farmers.
• Successful implementation of redistributive policies
calls for a stronger state role.
• Global forces are now a major factor in the movement
of inequality within and between countries, and
should be managed more deliberately to avoid negative
repercussions for the poorest countries.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 2 – INCOME INEQUALITY AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE

The chapter is organized as follows.
Section 1 discusses why inequality matters in the ﬁght
against poverty.
Section 2 reviews the evidence for trends in inequality
globally.
Section 3 examines the links between structural change
and global intersectoral terms of trade in contributing to
inequality. It also discusses how both domestic structural
change and external forces affect inequality in a number
of countries representing different patterns and stages of
development.
Section 4 concludes with a discussion of redistributive
policies that governments can adopt to create wealthier,
more equitable societies.

1. Income Equality and
Poverty Reduction
As noted above, equity has intrinsic value and is central
to the achievement of human rights and citizenship. One
dimension of inequality – related to income and wealth –
is closely linked to poverty. At the most basic level, the
distribution of income within a country has a direct impact
on the welfare of its people. A more equal distribution
of national income means that aggregate welfare (where
the welfare of each individual is given equal weight) is
higher for any given level of average per capita income,
and poverty is lower.

While greater equality is often
considered to come at the expense of
growth, lower inequality can contribute
to greater economic efﬁciency

While greater equality is often considered to come at
the expense of growth, there is also evidence that under
some circumstances, and with appropriate institutional
arrangements, lower inequality can contribute to greater
economic efﬁciency. The development of the Scandinavian countries is illustrative here. Through a process
known as the Meidner-Rehn mechanism,7 political commitment to egalitarian economic outcomes constrained
business from competing on the basis of wage costs, which
were consequently higher than those of their international
competitors. Companies were therefore forced to raise
labour productivity in order to stay competitive.8 This
policy preceded the advance of the region from the middle to the top of the European (and world) income scales.
A similar effect was seen in the United States during the
New Deal of the 1930s and the golden age of economic
growth. For the European region as a whole, there is evidence that countries with lower inequality have better
employment performance.9 In other words, business can
absorb technological change at a faster pace in societies
that systematically reduce disparities in pay structures,
encouraging an increase in productivity and raising per
capita incomes faster than the global average.

High levels of inequality inhibit development
At the same time, a growing body of evidence points to
the negative relationship between high levels of inequality
(often considered to be a Gini coefﬁcient more than 0.4)
and improvements in economic and social well-being.10
High levels of income inequality are dysfunctional for
development for a number of reasons.11
• First, high levels of inequality make it harder to
reduce poverty through growth. With high levels
of inequality, growth tends to be concentrated in
certain sectors, with those who are not linked to these
growth sectors being excluded from the beneﬁts. Such
exclusion, in turn, lowers the potential for growth,
particularly in a context of poverty, by constraining the
productive capacity of the poor and thus their potential
contribution to growth. Under such circumstances,
a large proportion of the workforce (the poor) have

61

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

•

limited productive capacities for reasons that include
inadequate nutrition and ill health, low levels of
education or skills, a lack of employment opportunities
or limited access to productive assets, such as land
and credit. Furthermore, the economic exclusion
of a signiﬁcant proportion of the population
contributes to their social and political exclusion
through processes of disempowerment and lack of
recognition or representation.
Second, high levels of inequality can also retard
growth by translating into lower effective aggregate
demand in the economy. In highly unequal societies,
the poor are more likely to be locked into a subsistence
economy and have limited disposable income for the
purchase of manufactured goods. This limits the size
of the domestic market and hinders the potential for
industrialization that is an important driver of growth.
Third, high levels of inequality have negative
implications for the building of inclusive states that
have the capacity to implement redistributive and
progressive economic and social policies. High levels of
inequality may also undermine the realization of civil,
political, economic and social rights, and the exercise
of substantive citizenship. Inequality is often a factor
in rising levels of crime and social unrest, which are
inimical to growth. In extreme cases, especially where
inequality is manifested along ethnic lines, it can lead
to war and the failure of the state (see chapter 3).
Fourth, without deliberate policy interventions,
high levels of inequality tend to be self-perpetuating.
They lead to the development of political and
economic institutions that work to maintain the
political, economic and social privileges of the elite.
In highly unequal societies, the poor have little
political inﬂuence; in the absence of meaningful
representation to change underlying structures that
perpetuate inequalities, they may become locked into
poverty traps from which it is difﬁcult to escape.
Finally, even under conditions of rapid growth,
inequality is likely to be reinforced by the distribution
of the externalities of growth. For example, the
poor are most likely to bear directly the burden
of environmental degradation arising from rapid

62

industrialization. Only when the fruits of growth
are distributed equitably – either directly as income
or socially through the provision of infrastructure
and other public goods – is the statistical fact of a
rising gross domestic product (GDP) experienced
as an improvement in overall living conditions
and well-being.

Only when the fruits of growth are
distributed equitably is the statistical
fact of a rising GDP experienced as
an improvement in well-being

2. Global Trends in Inequality
The global income gap remains daunting
Economic growth is important in facilitating structural
change that is poverty reducing.12 An assessment of the
per capita incomes of major regions and countries from
1960–2006 illustrates the persistence of the global income
gap and how little real and sustained economic growth
has occurred for most developing economies, in terms of
substantially improved per capita GDP. Although most
countries in the developing world experienced episodes
of growth during this period,13 that growth has not been
sustained in most cases. Nor has it generated decent jobs.
The income gap (in terms of per capita GDP) between
rich and poor countries has not lessened.14 Figure 2.1
provides evidence on real per capita incomes (in constant
2000 US dollars) across some major country groupings
for 1960–2006, illustrating the persistently large income
gap between rich and poor countries. Indeed, the differences in per capita incomes in 1960 were so large that
even quite rapid growth in some regions over the
subsequent four and half decades has not made the gap
more respectable.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 2 – INCOME INEQUALITY AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE

Thus, while the per capita income of the fastest growing developing region – East Asia – increased more than
tenfold over this period (compared to an increase of less
than threefold for the United States), in 2006, the average
income in the United States was still 15 times that of East
Asia. For other developing regions, per capita income gaps
were even larger and are, in some cases, growing. Thus,
the per capita GDP in 1960 of countries currently in the
euro zone was 34 times that of South Asia; by 2006, this
had increased slightly to 36 times. For sub-Saharan Africa,
the widening gap is much starker. In 1960, the per capita
income of countries now in the euro zone area was 15 times
that of sub-Saharan Africa; by 2006, the difference was
38-fold.

Income inequality has increased
in the majority of countries around
the world
Countries vary widely in the nature of their income distribution. The Gini coefﬁcient – the most commonly used
measure of income inequality – ranges from 0.20 in Slovakia to 0.74 in Namibia,15 on a scale where 0 represents
perfect equality and 1 represents total inequality. In general, the variance in income inequality among developing
countries is much higher than that among rich countries.
Countries with per capita incomes of $20,000 or more have
coefﬁcients within the range of 0.25–0.45,16 whereas for
many low-income countries they are more than 0.50. High
inequality is thus a feature of underdevelopment.

In many developing countries, extreme inequalities are
driven by highly skewed distribution in the ownership
of land. A high level of inequality (see table 2.1), such
as that found in many Latin American countries, is difﬁcult to transform without radical land reform. Conversely,
more egalitarian land distribution creates a strong base
for maintaining lower levels of inequality in the process
of development. The initial structure of an economy –
whether based on capital-intensive extractive industries or
labour-intensive manufacturing, for example – also affects
the level of income inequality likely to be found as well as
the ease with which policies for income redistribution can
be implemented.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 2 – INCOME INEQUALITY AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE

The development experience of the ﬁrst wave of East Asian
states demonstrates that rising inequality in the early stages
of development is not inevitable. In the case of the Republic
of Korea and Taiwan Province of China, radical land reforms
that preceded industrialization, the use of labour-intensive
technologies during the early stages of industrialization,
and investments in human capital that helped balance
out opportunities available in urban and rural settings and
across income groups were important factors in preventing
the growth of inequality. High levels of growth without rising inequality were also seen in Singapore and Hong Kong,
China, both city-states where agriculture was insigniﬁcant
but where governments implemented basic social (particularly housing) policies to support the growth process.

Over the past two decades of economic
liberalization, it has been much harder
for countries to achieve high growth
rates without increases in inequality

Over the past two decades of economic liberalization, it
has been much harder for countries to achieve high growth
rates without increases in inequality. Recent studies point
to the fact that inequality has increased in the majority of
countries throughout the world. One recent study17 found
that income inequality increased in 30 out of a sample of
49 countries between the 1990s and the 2000s. It remained
unchanged in six countries and in only 13 countries did it
decrease. A similar result has been presented in a recent
study by the International Labour Organization (ILO). It
found that, between 1990 and 2000, “more than two-thirds
of the 85 countries for which data are available experienced an increase in income inequality, as measured by the
Gini index”.18 Of the 20 advanced countries in the sample,
inequality decreased in only four, while of the 21 transition
countries in the sample, inequality decreased in only three.
Among the developing countries studied, patterns of change
tend to vary by region. In Asia, inequality decreased in only

two out of eight countries. Signiﬁcantly, India and China
were among the countries that experienced an increase in
inequality. In Latin America, inequality declined in six out
of 15 countries for which data were available. It was only
in the Middle East and North Africa and in sub-Saharan
Africa that more countries experienced a decline rather
than an increase in inequality. However, even though
inequality decreased in these regions, the resulting level of
inequality remained high (a Gini coefﬁcient of more than
0.40) in most of the countries studied.

The gap is growing between wage
earners and those who derive their
income from proﬁts
A broad pattern of growing income inequality under economic liberalization, reﬂected in rising Gini coefﬁcients, is
supported by data on other dimensions of inequality. An
important indicator in this regard is the functional distribution of income – that is, the distribution of income between
wages (income from labour) and proﬁts (income from capital). This provides a general indication of how well wage
earners are faring relative to employers and others who
derive their income from the ownership of capital, such as
productive equipment and ﬁnancial assets. Typically, industrialized countries have only a small sector of self-employed
producers, and the bulk of total income derives from either
wages or proﬁts. As a result, the share of wages in GDP is
closely correlated with changes in overall income inequality as determined by a summary measure such as the Gini
coefﬁcient. Thus a rise in the share of wages in GDP is
likely to mean a reduction in overall inequality, since wage
earners tend to be at the lower end of income distribution,
while the opposite is true of those who derive their incomes
from proﬁts. A rise in the share of wages also usually reﬂects
a tight labour market and the increased bargaining strength
of workers.
In developing countries, the picture is less clear-cut,
since there is often a large informal sector consisting of
self-employed petty producers or service-providers whose
meagre incomes place them at the bottom of the income

65

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

scale. Yet their incomes are usually recorded in national
statistics as proﬁt or a return on the assets used to engage
in economic survival activities. In this context, there is
no simple interpretation of what a change in the share of
wages in GDP means in terms of overall inequality. For
example, if an increase in the share of non-wage income is
largely due to an increase in average incomes in the informal sector, then this would be a desirable change from a
distributional standpoint. Nevertheless, even in countries
with high levels of informality, an analysis of the change in
the wage shares that is conﬁned to only the formal sector
of the economy can provide useful information on trends in
inequality. A change in wage shares within the formal sector can be interpreted in the same way as an overall change
in the wage share of advanced economies. For instance, a
decline in the wage share in the manufacturing sector of a
developing country does tell us that the bargaining strength
of workers is weakening, either because of an excess supply
of labour relative to demand, the strengthened power of
employers due to increased exit options as a result of globalization, or the suppression of labour unions or collective
bargaining mechanisms.

Between 1980 and 2000,
the average wage share of national
income fell by 10 points in the euro
zone, a clear sign of redistribution
from labour to capital

A study commissioned by UNRISD,19 based on panel data
for 25 member countries of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) over the period
1973–2003, found that the wage share of national income
fell or remained constant in 23 cases. These falls were quite
large in some cases. Between 1980 and 2000, the average labour share fell by 10 points in the euro zone20 – one
of the largest decreases and a clear sign of redistribution

66

from labour to capital. The study also found evidence of a
strong and persistent link between functional and personal
income distribution. In the sample of 25 countries, 17 of
the 18 countries that experienced an increase in inequality
in the functional distribution of income also experienced a
simultaneous increase in inequality in the personal distribution of income.
The same phenomenon appears to have been at work in
some developing countries. Bearing in mind the difﬁculties in interpreting changes in the functional distribution
of income in developing countries, it is still signiﬁcant to
note the ﬁndings from a recent ILO study.21 The study,
which covered 29 advanced, 33 developing and 11 transition economies, concluded that three-quarters of them
witnessed a decline in the wage share of national income.
The fastest decrease – of more than 13 per cent – was found
in Latin America. The advanced economies and Asia also
experienced signiﬁcant declines. Wage shares fell in Asia by
over nine percentage points during the period 1985–2002,
and by the same amount in advanced economies over the
period 1980–2005.

3. Inequality, Structural Change
and Global Intersectoral Terms
of Trade
How should these changing patterns of inequality among
and within countries in a globalized economy be explained?
Is there a common global pattern and, if so, what does
this tell us about global economic governance? To answer
these questions, this section examines global, regional and
national datasets on economic inequality developed by the
University of Texas Inequality Project.22 These datasets are
a unique resource, providing consistent and reliable measures of pay inequality for a large number of countries from
the early 1960s to the early years of the twenty-ﬁrst century.
These measures suggest certain broad patterns and relationships between economic inequality and structural change
(see box 2.1).

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 2 – INCOME INEQUALITY AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE

BOX 2.1: A methodology for measuring income inequality
The measures of inequality derived from the University of Texas Inequality Project (UTIP) can be applied to many sources of data
and do not require recourse to micro-level datasets derived from sample surveys. The resulting measures are often comparable
both through time and across countries.a The method is summarized in Conceição et al. (2001) and is based on the work of
Theil (1972), who argued that an inequality measure computed from grouped data provides a consistent lower-bound estimate of
inequality for the entire population. Relatively coarse disaggregation is sufﬁcient to capture the major movements of inequality in the
whole distribution.

Income distributions are approximate statistical fractals (that is, they produce similar patterns at different scales and from different
points of observation), so that observation of the entire distribution, or even of a statistically representative portion of it, is not
necessary in order to observe change with reasonable accuracy most of the time. All that is required is to observe an important part of
the distribution (say, the manufacturing sector) on a consistent basis over time. Since this part is linked organically to other parts that
may not be observed, such as agriculture and services, movements in the observed part are usually – but not always – representative
of movements in the shape of the entire distribution. Changes in the structure of incomes often occur because of changes in the
relative positions of major industrial groupings (a rise of industry over agriculture, for instance, or of ﬁnance over industry) or in the
relative position of different geographic areas, differentially affected by demographic change, climate or war. Thus, after a certain
point, further disaggregation adds little useful information.

The inequality measures developed by the UTIP are also broadly consistent with conventional, survey-based income inequality
measures, or can be made so by statistical adjustment after allowing for conceptual differences between pay and income and for the
many different kinds of inequality that are reported in the survey-based literature (for example, income, expenditure, gross or net of
tax, household or personal).b The dataset on which the UTIP measures are based covers more than a hundred countries over three or
four decades. Measures of inequality may also be calculated both within and among regions inside many countries. In some countries,
inequality measures can be computed on a monthly basis.

However, it is important to note that the UTIP approach has its limitations. Of these, perhaps the most important is that the work
is statistical and comparative; it cannot be substituted for detailed case-by-case analysis. The UTIP data are also largely focused
on pay, aggregated by sector and region. Pay is associated with jobs, not with households, and the datasets lack information on
the characteristics of the workers or their families. For this reason, the UTIP studies are not well suited to an analysis of the social
welfare consequences of political and economic change, nor of the effects of such change on gender or ethnicity, except where these
attributes are associated with the distribution of jobs. Finally, the data are entirely pretransfer, and shed no light on the post-transfer
distribution of income. However, transfer payments are very limited outside of the OECD region. Within that region, the scale of
transfers is closely correlated with the equality or inequality of pay structures, so that the inequality rankings found in the UTIP data
would not change much if post-transfer income were included.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Early development thinking held that inequality
rose in the early stages of development, and
then declined
An important strand of early development thinking held
that an inverted-U shaped curve described the relationship between the level of development and the degree
of inequality in the distribution of income. The Kuznets
curve23 summarized a process whereby inequality increased
in the initial stages of development but then reversed itself
as development proceeded. Kuznets identiﬁed the transition from agriculture to industry as the prime mover of
a process of increasing inequality in the early stages
of economic development, simply because towns and
cities are always richer on average than the countryside around them. However, as economic development
matured, the weight of agriculture in the whole economy
would shrink, and ultimately urban phenomena would
come to dominate the evolution of inequality. At that
point, Kuznets argued, the dynamics of factory life, including the rise of labour unions and democratic politics, would
cause inequality to decline.
The Kuznets curve describes a process of structural change
(or intersectoral transition) speciﬁc to the history of economic
development in the United States, the United Kingdom,
much of Europe, and Japan. The process has been repeated
elsewhere – but not everywhere. In mineral-rich countries
dominated by extractive industries, or in post-industrial societies dominated by services such as technology and ﬁnance,
different patterns would be expected. Kuznets’ enduring message is not that a single curve should be found in the history
of all countries in all periods, but that the essence of understanding inequality lies in understanding the intersectoral
transitions, or structural changes, that produce it.
Figure 2.2 shows an augmented Kuznets curve,24 which
suggests that for large agrarian societies in the process of
industrialization, of which China is the leading example
today, the rural-to-urban transition still drives the rise in
inequality. In only a few other industrializing countries
does the agrarian population remain sufﬁciently large for
the intersectoral transition out of agriculture to dominate

68

the picture; most developing countries, especially outside
Africa, are over the hump of the inverted-U (if the hump
exists) and on the downward-sloping portion of the curve.

Among the highest income countries, notably the United
States, the United Kingdom and Japan, a different dynamic
takes over.25 The most advanced economies have procyclical movements of inequality, because their highest income
sectors, services in technology and ﬁnance, enjoy their
greatest income growth in boom times, whether driven by
domestic investment or by exports. This is also true of small
economies dominated by services such as ﬁnance and real
estate, of which Hong Kong, China is a prominent modern
example. Meanwhile, the world is speckled with monoline producers (that is, countries dependent on a single
commodity, such as oil) where distribution is driven by
the peculiar characteristics of an extractive economy. They
are characterized by high per capita income, a low-wage
(often immigrant) manual workforce and high inequality.

Global intersectoral terms of trade are
a key determinant of inequality
Intersectoral transitions (structural changes between agriculture, industry and services) within countries, and the global

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 2 – INCOME INEQUALITY AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE

terms of trade between these sectors, are closely connected.
We would therefore expect global intersectoral terms of trade
to inﬂuence inequality within countries, even in the absence
of signiﬁcant structural change. Thus, a boom in commodity
prices will tend to reduce inequality in a country with an
important agricultural sector, simply because it tends to raise
the relative income of farmers; whereas a fall in commodity
prices will depress incomes in such a country. A cartel action
to increase the price of oil gives producers resources to redistribute or invest (for example, into construction); meanwhile, it may raise the cost of production and consumption
in other countries, increasing unemployment among industrial workers and squeezing the incomes of the middle classes
in wealthier countries.
In a world of globalized ﬁnancial and commodities markets,
these effects will be global: they should show up everywhere
(or almost everywhere) at once, and they do.26 From the early
1960s onwards, patterns in the expansion or contraction in
the level of inequality have tended to be found during the
same time period within countries around the world. These
patterns have four phases, as illustrated in ﬁgure 2.3.

Four phases of inequality
The ﬁrst phase, which occurred from the ﬁrst observed year
(1963) until around 1971, was a period of relative stability,
with no common movement in the measures of inequality.
The second phase, from 1972 until around 1980, was a
period of moderate decline in inequality in much of the
world. This period coincided with the collapse of the global ﬁnancial framework of the Bretton Woods era, and the
subsequent inﬂationary boom, abetted by large-scale commercial bank lending at negative real interest rates.
The third phase is one of sharply rising inequality, beginning around 1982 and continuing to the end of the century.
It was associated with the calamity of the global debt crisis,
initially most severe in Latin America and Africa, followed
by the collapse of communist governments in Central and
Eastern Europe, and ﬁnally by a wave of deregulation and
liberalization in Asia in the 1990s. The speciﬁc experience
of countries and regions varies, but they share several common characteristics: collapsing imports; a shrinking ﬁscal
base and therefore public sector retrenchment; trade liberalization; de-industrialization; and the simultaneous decline
of both the civil service and the industrial working class.
Globalization eventually brought ﬁnancial investment to
some countries, stimulating the rise of new sectors – most
notably real estate, insurance and banking – accompanied
by global pay scales and a rise in speculation. The overall pattern almost exactly resembles that found in another
major study27 that examined inequality among countries,
unweighted by population. This should not come as a surprise: events that increase the gap between rich and poor
people within countries should also, in principle, broaden
the gap between rich and poor countries, since the latter
are just unbalanced collections of the former.
The pattern has exceptions. India and China, for example,
avoided the global rise in inequality in the 1980s, arguably
because they had not liberalized their ﬁnancial markets,
and were therefore relatively unaffected by the debt crisis. While inequality in China had started to rise from low
levels during the 1980s, the sharp and problematic rise in
inequality dates from the crisis of 1989. In India, the rise in

69

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

The fourth phase, beginning in 2001, is again one of
declining inequality. It coincides with the marked relaxation of credit conditions that followed the attacks of
11 September 2001 in the United States and a repudiation
of the Washington consensus policies (the reform package
promoted by Washington, DC–based institutions such as
the International Monetary Fund/IMF, the World Bank
and the United States Treasury Department) associated
with adverse growth and social development in many countries. These changes appear to have permitted both higher
growth and some abatement of the extreme increases in
inequality that had afﬂicted the developing world for the
previous 20 years. The commodities boom during this
period also beneﬁted low-income agrarian countries. The
dramatic onset of the global economic crisis in 2008 has
undoubtedly brought an abrupt end to this brief period of
declining inequality. Low-income agrarian economies now
face sharply reduced growth, a contraction of output, rising
unemployment and a renewed rise in poverty.

These exceptions help to conﬁrm the hypothesis that a

structural change within countries, but global forces affecting intersectoral terms of trade.

Most low-income agrarian economies
are highly unequal
If the global element in rising inequality in the 1980s and
1990s had not existed, there would have been no increase
in economic inequality on average around the world.
Indeed, given the Kuznets forces affecting inequality in
the process of economic development, inequality in most
countries and on average would have declined. Figure 2.4
illustrates this calculation, separating out member countries of the OECD and non–OECD countries to show how
global forces affect each group. The ﬁgure also illustrates a
core fact: high-income industrialized countries enjoy markedly more equality, on average, than low-income developing countries.

The high inequality of most low-income agrarian societies may be puzzling. However, particularly in the tropics,
agricultural arrangements are frequently descended directly
from feudal land tenure systems or from slavery. Such
arrangements differ from the historical cases examined
by Kuznets, such as the United Kingdom and nineteenthcentury North America, or from the East Asian economies
after land reform, where small freeholders predominated.
Except in some parts of Africa, low-income agrarian economies with egalitarian income structures are rare, and in
the past century have tended to emerge only after violent

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 2 – INCOME INEQUALITY AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE

revolution, as in China (1949), Cuba (1959) and Viet Nam.
Even in these countries, however, inequality is rising (albeit
from very low levels) with more liberal economic reforms.

High-income industrialized countries
enjoy markedly more equality,
on average, than low-income
developing countries

Without these countries, it is doubtful whether the
inverted-U shaped curve would have a low-income
upward-sloping component at all in recent decades. Figure
2.5 illustrates the relationship between the share of agriculture in total employment and inequality in manufacturing
pay for a selection of developed and developing countries.
The positive relationship is strong and consistent: the
higher the population in agriculture, the higher the level
of inequality.

Taken together, the issues outlined above paint a complex
picture, yet one with regular features. For any given country, the movement of inequality can be said to depend on
three factors:
• the position of the country on an augmented Kuznets
curve, reﬂecting previous processes of structural change;
• the current process of structural change and growth in
income; and
• the country’s integration into the global economy, and
thus the external impact of changes in intersectoral
terms of trade.
In sum, in most cases, structural change in the process of
economic development tends to reduce inequality. Exceptions exist, two of which are:
• low-income post-revolutionary agrarian societies in the
process of urbanization, industrialization and transition
to market capitalism; and
• high-income post-industrial societies as they
move towards economies dominated by services in
technology and ﬁnance.
Likewise, crises and shocks that periodically disrupt
the processes of economic development tend to raise
inequality. Structural change in the process of economic
development is relatively slow, whereas the impact of shock
and crisis is rapid and highly visible in the data (although
such events have been relatively rare to date, at least at a
global level).

For this reason, changes in relative prices (or the terms of
trade) between sectors tend to dominate the actual movement of economic inequality. Commodity booms generally
beneﬁt lower income developing countries, while ﬁnancial
bubbles and interest rate shocks generally beneﬁt highincome groups within ﬁnancialized economies, at least in
relative terms. Since oil and grain prices and interest rates
are set in global markets, it is not surprising that the movement of economic inequality should now be largely a common global phenomenon, operating in much the same way
(though certainly not symmetrically) in most of the world.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Rapid industrialization: The case of China
China provides a classic example of the evolution of
inequality dominated by internal structural change, at least
until very recently. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country
was largely insulated from external relative price changes.
Although it is now well integrated into international food
and fuel markets, it still enjoys an internal price level for
most labour-intensive wage goods, such as food, clothing and
housing, that is far lower than the external prices of these
goods. Rapid growth starting from the point of an agrarian
economy that had undergone major reforms after the egalitarian practices of communism implied rising inequality,
accelerated by urbanization as growing urban-rural differentials prompted greater migration from the countryside into
the cities. This dynamic constitutes China’s greatest social
challenge, and authorities are locked in an ongoing effort
to balance control over internal migration with a construction programme sufﬁciently vast to accommodate the urban
inﬂows that cannot be prevented.

In recent years, China’s picture has been complicated by
large inﬂows of speculative capital. Some of it is moving
through the current account in the trail of an enormous
export boom, which has, in turn, fuelled an epic real-estate
boom in Beijing, Shanghai and a few other locations. These
factors exacerbate inequalities between rural and urban
areas, as well as between different regions or provinces.

Based on the arguments and framework developed above,
the remainder of this section highlights key features of the
development experience of a number of countries. These
cases illustrate the relationship between different stages
and patterns of structural change, exposure to external
economic forces and inequality.

Figure 2.6 illustrates the changing contribution of various
Chinese provinces to the country’s inequality up to 2007.
Each segment of each bar represents the contribution to
overall inequality of a particular province in a particular
year. Those provinces with incomes above the national
average show positive values, and those with incomes below
the national average show negative values. The ﬁgure provides a succinct measure of the rise and fall in relative terms
of Chinese provinces relative to each other. Of particular
note is the contribution of Beijing, neither a coastal city
nor a primary centre for the production of goods for export,
which continued to rise even after the diffusion of economic
growth caused the relative shares of Guangdong and Shanghai to tail off in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This is at
least in part related to the construction boom that preceded
the 2008 Olympics and illustrates the extent to which ﬁnancial forces may be coming to dominate and to destabilize the
pattern of relative incomes inside China.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 2 – INCOME INEQUALITY AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE

Dualism and industrial crisis: Brazil and Mexico
In most of Latin America, by contrast, large-scale urbanization, globalization and, speciﬁcally, the internationalization of ﬁnance occurred decades ago. In the 1980s and
1990s, countries found themselves afﬂicted by the (closely
related) scourges of negative growth and adverse termsof-trade shocks as well as by the debt crisis, all of which
increased inequality. In Mexico and Brazil, the debt crisis
and resulting industrial slump were associated with a sharp
rise in inequality,29 as the collapse of import-substituting
industries diminished the unionized working class. It is reasonable to infer that import-substituting industrialization
had worked to reduce the (very high) inequalities associated with traditional Latin American economic dualism,
and that the later shift towards an export-oriented growth
model would again be characterized by a more unequal
income structure. However the short-term movement of
inequality during the transition between these two models was clearly governed by the same forces that generated
macroeconomic and industrial crises in the ﬁrst place.

In the 1980s and 1990s,
Latin American countries found
themselves afﬂicted by negative
growth and adverse terms of trade
as well as by the debt crisis, all of
which increased inequality
The experience of Mexico and Brazil during this period
also illustrates the simple relationship between wage inequality in industry and the rate of economic growth. As
long as economic growth is sufﬁciently rapid to absorb the
natural rise in the labour force, inequality in pay structures
tends to be stable or decline. When growth falls short of
that threshold, inequality tends to increase.30 For countries
in the latter situation, combating rising inequality is, in
large part, a matter of restoring stable internal growth and
thus absorbing the growing labour force into productive
employment. But as long as such countries remain exposed

to external ﬁnancial shocks, more stable global ﬁnancial
governance must also be part of the solution.
The experience of Mexico during the peso crisis in 1995
demonstrates the connection between external ﬁnance
and economic inequality for many developing countries.
A position on the periphery of the global economy implies
important trading relations with much richer countries,
and therefore a duality in the productive economy at home
– between producers who sell to the external market and
those who sell to domestic consumers. Workers in the
former tend to be better paid than those in the latter, simply
because industries with rich customers who earn hard currency can afford to pay a premium for labour. The former
are also much better insulated against a currency crisis.
When the peso crisis hit Mexico in 1995, export sectors
were able, for the most part, to simply translate their dollar
earnings into peso wages at the new exchange rate. Those
who produced for the domestic economy, as manufacturers
or as service providers, could not do this, and their relative wages fell instantly as the peso collapsed. In addition,
their markets subsequently dried up, since consumers were
forced to pay more for imported staples (such as corn) that
were now available only at a dramatically higher peso price.
There was a sharp rise in inequality in pay in the Mexican
manufacturing sector following the 1995 peso crisis.31

Transition economies
In the industrialized economies of Central and Eastern
Europe, the combination of a large manufacturing sector
and a communist political regime produced low inequality
until the system collapsed in 1989. It is worth noting, however, that the collapse of communist regimes in Hungary,
Poland, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union was not unrelated to economic pressure. All were deeply indebted to
the West at a time of depressed prices for primary commodities and exceptionally high real interest rates. These
pressures exacerbated the underlying inefﬁciencies of the
communist system, prompting efforts at reform that eventually opened the door to regime change. At that point,
de-industrialization and price liberalization, leading to a
very rapid move towards world price levels, combined to
drive inequality up dramatically.

73

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

The case of the Russian Federation has been analysed
using data for the years 1990–2000.32 The dramatic
increase in inequality came in 1992, with the implementation of shock therapy, starting with price liberalization.
This resulted in the sudden collapse in the real wages of
both agricultural and manufacturing workers as well as of
non-commercial sectors, such as health and education,
previously supported by the state. Energy and ﬁnance consequently became the leading sectors of the new Russian
Federation, with Moscow rising as a world city in a country
otherwise mired in post-communist stagnation. The situation became so extreme by the end of the century that
the lightly populated western Siberian oil and gas regions
of Tiumen and Khanty-Mansy had become major drivers
of the inequality of Russian incomes overall. Meanwhile,
the conﬂict-affected regions of the southern Caucasus had
fallen far below the rest of the country in reported relative income. Figure 2.7 provides a schematic view of the
interprovincial shifts in the Russian Federation during the
disastrous transition decade.
FIGURE 2.7: Contributions of three provinces to
interprovincial inequality in the Russian Federation,

Financialized economies
In the United States, inequality rose from the early 1980s
under the demand shock of tight monetary policy and a
high dollar – a backward movement on a downward sloping
Kuznets curve. This movement was repeated in the recession
of the late 1980s. Inequality in pay, particularly in manufacturing, then declined through much of the following decade
as the economy recovered and eventually produced very high
levels of employment. Figure 2.8 illustrates the close relationship between inequality in the structure of manufacturing pay
in the United States and the rate of unemployment.

In the last years of the decade of the 1990s, rapid growth in
the United States was driven by a technology bubble. This
produced increasing inequality – represented as a move up
an upward-sloping segment of the Kuznets curve – as the
country moved through the transition from an industrial
economy to one largely centred on technology and ﬁnance.33
The effect of this increase in inequality on household incomes
was greatly exacerbated by the dramatic appreciation of
capital asset valuations on the reported income of a very
small number of very rich people. If the effects of rising
income in just ﬁve counties – New York (Manhattan), New
York; Santa Clara, San Francisco and San Mateo counties in
California; and King County in Washington – are removed

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 2 – INCOME INEQUALITY AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE

from the data, about half of the rise in between-county
inequality in household incomes in the United States in the
last years of the 1990s would not have occurred.34 Removing
the income growth of just 15 counties neutralizes the entire
increase in between-county inequality. Figure 2.9 illustrates
this ﬁnding, and shows that the rise (and occasional decline)
in income inequality in the United States is substantially
due to changing valuations on the stock market, speciﬁcally
the technology-rich NASDAQ.

it would be reasonable to see the diversion of resources into
banking as a principal motor of total income inequality in
Brazil. Using monthly data for the case of Argentina, ﬁgure
2.11 shows that the ﬁnancial crisis in 2002 triggered a process in which inequality – at least within the formal sector
– was reduced in the post-crisis years.

Financialization, or the growing dominance of the ﬁnancial
sector in national economies, is strongly linked to neoliberal
economic policy reform, which gained strength in the 1980s
and 1990s and tended to favour national ﬁnancial and political centres (Buenos Aires, Moscow, São Paulo, Shanghai
and Beijing) at the expense of the hinterlands. In the wake
of a ﬁnancial crisis or stabilization policies, such as Brazil’s
Real Plan, the share of the ﬁnancial sector in an economy
is likely to shrink and overall inequality among sectors and
regions to fall. Figure 2.10 illustrates this pattern for the case
of Brazil, which at the peak of neoliberal policies channelled
an extraordinary share of national income into the ﬁnancial
sector. Notwithstanding the small absolute size of the sector,

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Some countries have avoided rising inequality
Even though rising inequality was characteristic of the
period under discussion (the 1980s and 1990s), it was not
observed everywhere. In Northern Europe, notably in Scandinavia, historically among the most egalitarian regions in
the world, measures of inequality remained steady throughout the 1980s and at least into the early 1990s. The Nordic
experience relates in part to the strong tradition of unionization, centralized pay bargaining, and (in the case of
Norway) the collective management of resources gleaned
from the oil boom. Meanwhile, in parts of Southeast Asia,
especially Singapore and Indonesia, inequality appears to
have declined throughout the early 1990s. In parts of Latin
America, notably Brazil and Argentina, inequality appears
to have peaked with the crises of 1993 and 2002, respectively, and to have declined with the stabilizing growth
experienced in subsequent years.35

4. Redistributing Wealth and
Income: Implications for Policy
Poverty is far more than relative deprivation of material
goods; it may be accompanied by hunger, malnutrition, illhealth and morbidity, shortened life expectancy, illiteracy,
social exclusion and a constant struggle for survival.36 Given
the relationship between poverty and inequality presented
in this chapter, policies to reduce inequality are important
instruments for reducing poverty. Moreover, higher levels
of income inequality tend to undermine civil, political,
economic and social rights, as well as the realization of substantive citizenship and inclusive states.

Make deliberate policy choices to ensure that
growth and equity reinforce one another
In the 1990s, the view gained
the international development
growth rates were sufﬁcient to
cially if there were no changes

76

ground among some in
community that high
alleviate poverty, espein income distribution.

One highly publicized World Bank paper37 argued that
growth was good for the poor and that countries pursuing
Washington consensus policies enjoyed faster growth in
average incomes. This argument implies that governments
need not follow deliberately pro-poor growth policies and
that what matters most is the income level of the poor,
rather than equality. However, there is a growing body of
evidence suggesting that:
• there is no trade-off between equity and growth;
• an unequal income distribution is not immutable and
can be affected by economic and social policies;
• equity can make growth more inclusive and
pro-poor; and
• equity can also serve as an important agent of
economic growth.38
Recognition that equity and growth can be mutually reinforcing still leaves open the question about the necessary
economic and social policies to produce such an outcome.
While current research disputes the simplistic view of tradeoffs between equity and growth, it does not suggest that the
virtual cycle of growth and equity is automatic. The possibility of a negative impact of one on the other suggests a
need for deliberate policy choices and design to ensure that
equity has a positive impact on growth, and vice versa.

Deliberate policy choices and design
are needed to ensure that equity
has a positive impact on growth,
and vice versa
Research has shown that the posited positive relationship
between growth and poverty reduction based on crosssection regressions across countries merely described an
average relationship around which there were signiﬁcant
disparities. A recent study39 shows that one-sixth of the
285 cases (consisting of different periods of time in different
countries) used in a World Bank study40 that downplayed
the role of redistributive policies in poverty reduction
in favour of growth, proved to be exceptions to the rule.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 2 – INCOME INEQUALITY AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE

These were cases in which growth failed to reduce poverty
or where poverty decreased without signiﬁcant growth.
An examination of these cases highlights the central role
played by redistributive policies. At different periods of
time in the Nordic countries, as well as in developing countries such as Colombia, El Salvador and Peru, strong redistributive policies meant that poverty decreased by more
than was predicted in the study. In the case of developing
countries, land reform was a prominent aspect of these policies. Conversely, in cases where poverty either increased or
decreased less than predicted, there was a reversal or weakening of these same redistributive policies. Other studies,41
including some from the World Bank itself, have shown
that in countries with high levels of inequality, poverty is
reduced more slowly in response to higher growth. Similarly, periods of highest growth were not necessarily the
ones in which poverty reduction was the greatest. Even in
countries with fast growth and poverty reduction, regional
pockets of poverty and deprivation have persisted. This
suggests that growth alone is insufﬁcient to reduce poverty
and that redistributive policies to change the distribution
of income and assets are important.
Redistributive policies that countries can adopt include
those that:
• provide the poor with greater access to productive
assets, such as land, and reform inequitable
tenancy arrangements;
• stimulate investment in irrigation and rural roads,
create public works programmes for infrastructure
development and increase access to credit;
• initiate ﬁscal reforms to improve tax administration,
prevent tax evasion and avoidance, and limit
opposition to progressive taxation and redistribution;
• generate employment opportunities;
• enhance the welfare of the poor through sound
social policies; and
• help create a stable global economic environment
that responds to the needs of poor countries.
Chapter 1 has discussed strategies for improving employment opportunities, and Section two of the report will
examine social policies and tax strategies for redistributive

and socially inclusive outcomes. The remainder of this
chapter will highlight a number of issues related to ﬁscal
redistribution, land reform, improving the livelihoods of
small farmers, and global economic governance.

Strengthen the role of the state
in ﬁscal redistribution
Successful implementation of redistributive policies calls
for a stronger state role. Fiscal redistribution, which entails
both progressive taxation and patterns of expenditure that
improve the welfare of the poor, has occurred only to a very
limited extent in developing countries. In contrast to many
industrialized countries where ﬁscal redistribution brings
about a drop in the Gini coefﬁcient of 10–15 per cent, it is at
most a few percentage points in most developing countries.
As chapter 8 argues, the main obstacle to ﬁscal redistribution is the low tax base, due to the large proportion of the
population with low incomes and to the presence of a large
informal sector that is outside the tax net. Nevertheless,
it remains true that tax revenues are typically even below
this structurally determined level for several reasons. The
ﬁrst is a weakness in tax administration and consequent tax
evasion and avoidance, which tends to be widespread. The
second is the presence of generous tax concessions. And
a third is the trend in the era of increasing globalization
towards lowering rates of income and corporate taxation.
This, together with a parallel trend towards reliance on
indirect taxes, such as value added tax, reduces the progressivity of the tax system. Given these facts, there appears to
be room to increase both the yield and the progressivity of
the tax system through ﬁscal reforms, such as tightening tax
administration and resisting trends towards more regressive
forms of taxation.
Turning to the expenditure side, the picture is less bleak.
An increasing number of countries are introducing social
programmes for the poor, such as cash transfer schemes and
public works programmes. Despite their limitations, some
of these programmes have been large enough in scale to
have a perceptible impact on poverty reduction, as chapter 5 will show. In this regard, universal social protection

77

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

programmes tend to have a greater potential for redistribution and quality control than targeted programmes.
Improving the poor’s access to education, health care and
other social services, as described in chapter 6, also helps
to reduce inequalities and poverty. It enhances the capabilities of the poor and the efﬁciency or skill levels of the
labour force in general, in addition to reducing the burden
of disease. Public works programmes, which have gained
prominence in many low-income countries as strategies
for tackling poverty, should be focused not only on job
creation, but also on the building of local infrastructure,
since this will yield signiﬁcant positive externalities for the
affected local communities.

Refocus on land reform
The primary target for production-oriented public expenditures should be agricultural and rural development, since
they have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. A
central redistributive issue here is land reform. In countries
with a high degree of inequality in land ownership – and
concomitant high landlessness – well-implemented redistributive land reforms can yield gains in terms of reduced
poverty and inequality as well as increased output. The
redistributive beneﬁts of land reform will come not only
from the increased asset base and incomes of previously
landless and marginal farmers, but also from ending exploitation based on market and non-market power previously
wielded by landlords. In addition, the more balanced level
of land ownership that will emerge will yield external beneﬁts to local communities, since cooperative communal
projects to strengthen the local economy are more likely to
develop. Potential gains in production will also come from
the well-known inverse relationship between farm size
and productivity. Provided land reforms are accompanied
by effective programmes of support to small farmers, these
productivity gains can by very signiﬁcant. Smallholders in
agrarian economies where land is not a severe constraint
can beneﬁt from investments in rural infrastructure and
seedlings, extension services and credit.
Despite the success of land reforms in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China in the early

78

post-war period, and in several other countries since then,
land reform largely disappeared from the national and
international policy agenda in the 1980s. There was a
revival of interest in the issue in the mid-1990s, sparked by
the emergence of land-based conﬂicts in countries such as
Brazil, Mexico and Zimbabwe, as well as by the salience of
the issue in the aftermath of the overthrow of dictatorships
in Bolivia, Indonesia, the Philippines and South Africa.
Although it has reappeared on the policy agenda, the substance of discussions on land reform has taken a very different form. In line with neoliberal thinking, the focus has
been on market-based reform and no longer on the redistribution of land ownership. A key aspect of this approach
dictates that any transfers of ownership should be marketbased (willing seller, willing buyer), ruling out expropriation or compulsory purchase. In addition, it focuses on
increasing access to land through tenancy reform rather
than through ownership. Some of these tenancy reforms
reverse the outcomes of previous land reforms by removing ceilings on land ownership and tenancy. A driving
force is the promotion of capitalist agriculture, as reﬂected
in moves towards the privatization of communal land and
the encouragement of large-scale farming, spearheaded by
multinationals. There has been surprisingly little debate on
how this new approach compares to earlier approaches in
terms of potential beneﬁts, despite the obvious signiﬁcance
of this issue for redistributive policies. It would be timely
and beneﬁcial to open such a debate.

Look after the best interests of small farmers
Globalization has led to the growth of worldwide production chains for traditional export crops as well as a range of
ﬂoricultural and horticultural products that have increased
export opportunities for smallholders in developing countries. But this development does not obviate the need for
a strong state role in increasing the capacity of small farmers to respond to these new opportunities. Emerging global
production chains are dominated by large multinational
corporations that enjoy considerable market power; this
opens up the possibility of unfair contracts with low returns
and wages for the small farmers and workers involved.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 2 – INCOME INEQUALITY AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE

It also creates a new responsibility for governments to regulate the terms under which poor farmers are incorporated
into these production systems. In addition, some of these
new export opportunities are in specialized niche markets
that are very demanding in terms of the quality standards
that must be met. This severely curtails the number of
developing countries that can ﬁnd a foothold in these markets without extension and marketing services provided by
the state.
The growing dominance of multinational corporations in
global agriculture is also shifting research priorities away
from harnessing advances in biotechnology for the development of crops with higher yields that are better adapted
to local ecological conditions, which could be of immense
beneﬁt to poor farmers. Instead, attention has shifted to biotech applications that could raise proﬁts in large-scale commercialized agriculture. At the same time, publicly funded
crop research programmes of the type that produced the
green revolution have been declining both internationally
and nationally. It is important from the standpoint of redistributive and poverty reduction policies that these issues be
faced seriously with a view to framing counter-measures.

Advocate for reforms in the governance
of the global economy
Not only should all possible redistributive policies be considered on their own merit; they should also be placed
in the context of globalization and overall development
strategies. As explained earlier, income distribution and
poverty reduction are as much the outcome of a chosen
development strategy and global dynamics as of deliberate decisions about how much redistribution and what
type of redistributive policies a country adopts. Given the
importance of global economic forces in determining both
growth and income inequality in developing countries, and
in the wake of the economic crisis, special attention must
be given to reform in the governance of globalization. The
goal must include the creation of a global economic environment that is compatible with growth and poverty reduction in poor countries.

Key elements of this reform should include greater stability in
the international monetary system and in global commodity
markets; stronger support for the development of least developed countries; and the restoration of greater policy space
and autonomy to developing countries42 (see chapter 10).
Greater stability is required to avert a replay of the scenario in
which developing countries have seen their development and
poverty reduction efforts periodically nulliﬁed by ﬁnancial
crises and extreme ﬂuctuations in commodity prices, including those of food. Stronger support for the least developed
countries is required, entailing the reduction of vulnerability
to commodity price and interest rate shocks, more access to
rich country markets, increased ﬁnancial assistance, and phasing out of agricultural subsidies in rich countries that impact
adversely on poor countries. Similarly, greater policy space and
autonomy are essential because the combined straightjacket
of restrictive multilateral rules, neoliberal policy conditionality, and global ﬁnancial market discipline has clearly blocked
the adoption of more promising paths to development.
Chapter 1 has shown that deeper economic liberalization
and restrictive monetary policy have not always been the
optimal path. Several of the countries that have beneﬁted
from globalization, such as those in East Asia, and now
China, India and Viet Nam, have followed heterodox policies that involved controlled rather than all-out liberalization of trade and investment policies and of capital markets.
These countries maintained a measure of import protection, adopted selective industrial policies and retained controls over foreign direct investment ﬂows and the capital
account. In fact, there are few examples of countries that
have prospered from unfettered liberalization.
Developing countries need alternative monetary policies to
expand domestic markets, maintain competitive exchange
rates and improve access to credit. They also need ﬁscal policies that will support greater public investment, which is
essential for improving private sector productivity and market access by building new roads and providing better transportation. Unskilled labour is the most abundant factor of
production in developing countries, so making maximum
use of it, through labour-intensive production strategies, is
an efﬁcient strategy to raise growth and reduce inequalities.

CHAPTER

Tackling Ethnic and
Regional Inequalities
Structural change affects individuals, groups and regions
differently. Group membership is intrinsic to human development, and when the beneﬁts and costs of structural
change correspond to ethnic or religious afﬁnities, or geographic location, individuals may perceive development in
terms of those cleavages. Such inequalities can be a source
of conﬂict and adversely affect well-being. However, measures of inequality that rank individuals and households by
income often exclude group and spatial dimensions.
Group inequalities are closely linked to the ways in which
groups are integrated into different sectors of the economy,
as well as their representation in political and social institutions. They are also reﬂected in how identities are valued in
the cultural sphere. Such inequalities are therefore multidimensional and encompass economic, social, cultural and
political dimensions. Achieving equality in each of these
dimensions has intrinsic value, and is also instrumental in
promoting equality along other dimensions, or in achieving
other development goals.
Addressing ethnic and spatial inequalities is critical to
poverty reduction for a number of reasons. First, betweengroup (or horizontal) inequalities make up a large component of overall inequality within any country. A focus
on only vertical inequality (see chapter 2) may obscure
important differences among groups or regions. Some
groups may be seriously disadvantaged or have higher
than average concentrations of poverty even when overall vertical inequality is low. Second, regional inequality in large industrializing countries, as well as in most
developing and transition economies, appears to be on
the rise. If ethnic groups are geographically clustered,
industrialization or development may bypass groups that
are not located in economically dynamic zones, intensifying poverty in the neglected areas. Third, inequalities
between ethnic groups can lead to conﬂict, which is likely

3

to affect development. Indeed, most conﬂicts today tend
to have an ethnic dimension1 and are difﬁcult to resolve.
Fourth, horizontal or between-group inequalities are signiﬁcant because, in some situations, it may not be possible
to improve the position of individuals without tackling the
position of the group.
In ethnically diverse societies, spatial and ethnic inequalities may be closely interrelated, although the dynamics
may differ in situations where ethnic groups are highly
mobile or widely dispersed. Widening regional inequalities are typical of early stages of development, while
decreasing regional inequalities tend to characterize more
mature stages of development. However, it is not always
obvious how ethnic inequalities will evolve over time as
incomes increase.
Indeed, while ethnic inequalities are often created by a
foundational shock that may propel a country along a particular development trajectory, those inequalities often
persist for long periods of time after the shock. Moreover,
individuals may become trapped because of the difﬁculties
of moving across groups. Groups that start from a position
of privilege may forge ahead, while those that have historically been disadvantaged may fall into a vicious cycle,
or a relative poverty trap. Breaking through these cycles
of wealth accumulation will be crucial to tackling poverty
among disadvantaged groups.
The issues discussed in this chapter point to ﬁve main
conclusions.
• The process of development affects ethnic groups
and regions differently. Some groups and regions
may experience high levels of poverty and are
particularly disadvantaged even when economies
are growing and overall vertical inequality and
aggregate poverty are low.

81

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

• Redistributive policies can help mitigate ethnic
and spatial inequalities. It is easier to correct ethnic
inequalities if an economy is growing, the target
population has access to policy-making institutions,
and the redistributive policy is part of a wider strategy
to transform the economy and eliminate poverty,
irrespective of ethnicity.
• Afﬁrmative action policies may improve horizontal
inequalities but worsen intra-group and (overall)
vertical inequalities. Policies that target both ends
of the distribution curve may lead to improvements
in both inter- and intra-group income distribution;
those that focus on the upper end of the curve may
lead to a worsening of intra-group inequality.
• Regional disparities appear to respond well to regional
development strategies. Even poor countries that have
pursued such strategies have reduced poverty in the
worst-off areas.
• Correcting horizontal inequalities is political.
Without political inclusivity, there is little chance
of implementing effective remedial policies for
disadvantaged groups.
The chapter analyses the evolution of inequalities between
different regions and ethnic groups in selected countries as
well as policies for their mitigation.
Section 1 discusses conceptual issues, patterns of regional
inequality and reasons for the persistence of ethnic
inequalities.
Section 2 compares country case studies across multiple
dimensions of inequality and patterns of development.
Countries are classiﬁed as agrarian, industrializing and
dualist.
Section 3 concludes with a discussion of policies for
correcting horizontal inequalities.

1. Ethnic and Spatial Inequalities
and Development
In situations where regional and ethnic boundaries coincide, the reasons for regional inequalities may be more or
less the same as those behind ethnic inequalities. However,
where ethnic groups coexist within the same geographic
location, different factors may explain the emergence and
persistence of spatial and ethnic inequalities. This section
ﬁrst examines why spatial inequalities arise and how they
are likely to evolve.

Many factors contribute to spatial inequalities
The literature on economic geography offers two interrelated explanations for the emergence of spatial inequalities.
The ﬁrst relates to various endowments, such as natural
resources or proximity to rivers, coasts and borders. The
second relates to efﬁciency gains and agglomeration forces
that amplify a region’s initial advantage.2 Agglomeration forces can lead to “virtuous circles of self-reinforcing
development in some cities or regions, while other regions
lag behind”.3
The regional composition of public expenditure may
also contribute to regional inequalities. One study4 ﬁnds
that rural-urban disparities in neonatal care and school
enrolment in 24 African countries are closely linked to
disparities in the distribution of public education and
health services. Similarly, in Peru, research5 suggests that,
while geographic variables such as altitude, soil type and
temperature provide a good explanation for the regional
variance in income, once public infrastructure variables are
added to the model, geographic variables lose most of their
explanatory power.
Increased openness to international trade can also be a factor that intensiﬁes regional inequalities. Export-oriented
regions tend to beneﬁt more and grow faster than interior
regions.6 China’s increased openness to international trade
contributed signiﬁcantly to the sharp increases in regional

82

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 3 – TACKLING ETHNIC AND REGIONAL INEQUALITIES

inequalities after 1978.7 Similarly, Mexico’s spatial inequalities worsened as a result of trade liberalization prompted by
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).8

This assumes that regional inequalities are primarily generated by the transition from agriculture to industry, rather
than the post-industrial transition to services.

Policies that restrict migration can be another contributing factor. Restrictions on migration in China prevented
poor regions from beneﬁting fully from the rapid growth
of coastal regions and thereby contributed to increasing
regional inequalities.9 Similarly, in Chile, ﬁscal impediments including restrictions on the sale or rent of subsidized
housing effectively inhibited migration and contributed
to the persistence of regional inequalities in the 1980s
and 1990s.10

Figure 3.1 shows the relationship between the absolute
level of regional inequality plotted against the agricultural
contribution to the economy for six transition countries
in Eastern Europe from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.
The ﬁgure shows a remarkably clear and consistent trend:
higher levels of regional inequality are associated with
lower economic dependence on agriculture. It is worth noting here that no statistically signiﬁcant relationship holds
between the overall level of gross domestic product (GDP)
per capita and the level of inequality in these countries
(not depicted graphically).

Research suggests that an inverted-U shaped curve
describes the evolution of regional inequalities. In other
words, regional inequalities tend to increase in early stages
of development and typically decline as development
progresses.11 In the early stages of development, most economic activities tend to be concentrated in a few regions
where the income and production factors needed for their
generation are concentrated. This may lead to economies of scale, which boost the growth of those regions but
increase regional inequalities. However, at some point, the
initial growth areas will experience congestion costs associated with excessive agglomeration. There may also be
spatial diffusion of technology, and other regions may offer
new locational advantages to ﬁrms, such as lower production costs or lower levels of unionization. The spatial diffusion of development will eventually lead to a reduction of
regional inequality.12
Figures 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 show trends in regional inequality in
three sets of country groups. Regional inequalities are measured using the population-weighted coefﬁcient of variation
(the group coefﬁcient of variation/GCov).13 The focus is on
the relationship between regional inequalities and economic
structure, using the proportion of agricultural value added
as the explanatory variable rather than industry or services.

Figure 3.3 shows the same relationship for nine developed
countries. The ﬁndings here are very different. While
all countries have very low levels of agricultural value
added, the broad trend is the reverse: those countries with
particularly low agricultural dependance have very low
regional inequalities, although the relationship is weak.
In addition, the within-country variation across years is
much less signiﬁcant: while agricultural rates have shifted
over time for most countries, the level of spatial inequality has not changed noticeably over time, with the exception of Japan. These data strongly conﬁrm the view that
early stages of industrialization often lead to an increase
in regional inequalities, but the trend at the farther end of
the scale is less clear.

84

Ethnic inequalities are often rooted
in historical circumstances
Ethnic inequalities evolve differently. Certain historical
circumstances or foundational shocks14 that drive structural change, such as slavery or colonialism, are often
the basis for ethnic inequalities. In Malaysia, for instance,
the economic disadvantage of the Malay has its origins
in the ethnic division of labour established by the
British colonial government around the 1920s. While the
Europeans, Chinese and Indians were mostly employed in
the high-productivity modern sector as entrepreneurs,
managers and employees in ﬁrms, estates and trading
companies, the Malays were mostly engaged in lowproductivity peasant agriculture and ﬁshing. In the same
vein, ethnic inequalities in the United States have their
origins in 300 years of economic, physical, legal, cultural
and political discrimination based on ethnicity, with slavery as the foundational shock. Apartheid is also a foundational shock that has led to the persistence of South Africa’s
ethnic inequalities.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 3 – TACKLING ETHNIC AND REGIONAL INEQUALITIES

Ethnic inequalities are often created
by a foundational shock, but once
the shock has ended, such inequalities
tend to persist
In contrast to the hypothesized inverted-U shaped curve
relationship between regional inequalities and development, it is not clear how ethnic inequalities will evolve
as incomes increase. Indeed, while ethnic inequalities are
often created by a foundational shock, such inequalities
tend to persist for long periods after the shock has ended.
Scholars15 have identiﬁed the following factors as crucial to
the persistence of ethnic inequalities:
• Unequal rates of accumulation, due to inequalities in
income and imperfect markets. Deprivations or riches
at one point in time make it harder or easier
to accumulate assets in the future. If an individual
or group has a higher income due to higher assets,
then saving is easier. In theory, perfect capital markets
should enable people to borrow to overcome their
saving disadvantage. In practice, however, banks
require collateral, which means that borrowing,
too, is easier for the rich than for the poor. Extensive
empirical evidence shows that poorer individuals and
groups accumulate less, both with respect to human
and ﬁnancial capital.16
• Dependence on the returns of one type of capital to
make other types of capital available. For example,
human capital permits greater earnings, which enable
people to accumulate more. Financial capital is more
productive if people have human capital with which
to use it. Human capital may be more productively
employed if people have ﬁnancial capital, and both
types of capital are likely to be better used with
good social networks. Inequalities may intensify if
individuals or groups lack one or other type of capital.
• Asymmetries in social capital. Asymmetry in social
capital occurs among individuals – poor people tend to
have more contacts with other poor people than with
richer people. The same principle applies more strongly

among groups, since there is a strong tendency for
cultural groups to have more intra-group interactions
than inter-group ones.
• Discrimination by individuals and non-governmental
institutions. Group members are often subject to
discrimination or favouritism by non-group members
in accessing different types of capital and employment
by virtue of their group characteristics. Unequal
endowments today may be partly a reﬂection of
past discrimination. Effects persist even if equal
employment opportunities exist for the same
educational attainments, since past discrimination may
have led to inequality in educational endowments.
• Group inequalities often include political inequalities,
which may reinforce social and economic inequalities.
This means that those who are deprived socially
and economically also lack political power.
These political inequalities may exacerbate social
and economic inequalities, since they often lead to
bias in the distribution of government resources,
including access to services and government
employment and contracts.

Group inequalities often include political
inequalities, which may reinforce social
and economic inequalities

Combinations of these factors can result in vicious and
virtuous cycles: groups starting out in a privileged position accumulate more, have higher returns to assets and
thus sustain their privilege, while those who are underprivileged fall into a vicious cycle, or relative poverty trap.
Breaking through these cycles is crucial if poverty is to be
effectively addressed.
While the origins and evolution of spatial and ethnic
inequalities can sometimes be explained by similar factors, there are exceptions. Moreover, relatively moderate
regional inequalities may accompany very severe ethnic

85

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

inequalities, as in the United States and Malaysia in the
1960s. Where there is an overlap between ethnicity and
region, the factors that explain regional inequality are
likely to explain ethnic inequalities as well. Where this is
not the case, factors explaining regional inequalities are
less useful. However, in practice, the dynamics of regional
and ethnic inequalities are difﬁcult to separate and often
explain different parts of the same puzzle.

of women aged 15 to 49 are interviewed. In addition to
asking a range of questions on issues such as family planning, maternal and child health, reproductive behaviour,
contraception, breastfeeding and nutrition, the surveys also
ask questions about ethnic background, place of birth and
social and economic situation. An important assumption
is that inter-ethnic inequalities inferred from the women’s
questionnaires are a good approximation for the inequalities among ethnic groups in general. For some countries,
the LSMS has an ethnic variable and can therefore also be
used to assess inequalities among ethnic groups.

2. Ethnic and Spatial Inequalities
and Structural Change
How inequalities have evolved in agrarian
and industrializing economies
This section discusses the evolution of spatial and ethnic
inequalities in countries with different patterns of structural
change. In addition to determining the evolution of both
types of inequalities, it highlights the main policies that have
stimulated changes in inequality. It is important to note that
ethnic identities are not always easy to pin down, since they
are, for the most part, situational or constructed. Objective
attributes of language, religion, culture or shared history
can be fuzzy and may not always correctly describe a person’s ethnicity. Furthermore, ethnicity competes or overlaps
with many other forms of identity and is subject to change.17
This makes classiﬁcation of ethnic groups difﬁcult. Selfidentiﬁcation is important. However, many countries do not
include ethnicity as a variable in their censuses. Accurate
data on ethnicity are, therefore, not easily available.
The following case studies analyse the evolution of regional
inequalities in terms of income, poverty, employment and
access to services, drawing on data from censuses, domestic
household surveys, the World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) and the Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS). Since social and economic data are generally not available in ethnically disaggregated form, DHS are
the main data source for assessing ethnic inequalities. These
surveys have been conducted in about 70 developing countries and are usually repeated every ﬁve years. The standard
DHS consists of a household questionnaire and a women’s
questionnaire for which a nationally representative sample

86

Agrarian economies
As chapter 1 has shown, the failure of many low-income
countries to industrialize means that agriculture or mining continues to play a dominant role in their economies.
A large proportion of the agricultural labour force remains in
the subsistence sector, which accounts for the bulk of food
production but has lower returns than the agricultural export
sector and industry. If states do not have a redistributive
agenda, development strategies anchored in agricultural and
mineral exports may put regions and ethnic groups that are
located in resource-rich areas in a privileged position in terms
of investments, productive employment, services and infrastructure. Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire are illustrative of such a
situation. On the other hand, local ethnic groups in resourceendowed regions may be disadvantaged if more inﬂuential
outside groups use state power to appropriate the resources,
or if outside groups that have settled in the endowed regions
dominate the production or marketing of the resources.

Development strategies anchored

groups in resource-rich areas in
a privileged position

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 3 – TACKLING ETHNIC AND REGIONAL INEQUALITIES

Ghana. The country’s 23 million people are divided
into 92 ethnic groups, with four accounting for about
86 per cent of the population. Despite migration, ethnicity and administrative regions roughly coincide. The Akan
are by far the largest ethnic group with approximately
49 per cent of the population; they form the majority of
the population in ﬁve of the 10 regions in the south, followed by the Mole-Dagbani in the north, with around
17 per cent of the population. The third largest group,
with about 13 per cent of the population, are the Ewe,
found predominantly in the Volta region in the southeast.
The fourth largest group, with around 8 per cent of the
population, are the Ga-Dangme, who live mainly in
the Greater Accra region.18 Ethnic differences are partly
reinforced by religious differences: Muslims, who represent
only 16 per cent of the population, make up an important
part of the population in the north.

Colonial policy favoured
investment in southern regions;
there was very little development
of infrastructure or human
capital in the north

Most agricultural and mining activities are concentrated
in the south. British colonial policy favoured heavy investment in regions where gold, diamonds, timber and cocoa
were readily produced and cheapest to export. There was
very little development of infrastructure or human capital
in the north. Post-colonial development strategies reinforced these inequalities, including the structural adjustment policies of the 1980s, which channelled most funds to
the capital and to the cocoa, timber and mineral industries
in the western, eastern, Ashanti and Brong Ahafo regions.19
Some projects were undertaken in the north in the 1990s,
including the extension of the national electricity grid and
the rehabilitation of north-south roads, and expenditures

on education and health were increased. However, the
vast majority of public expenditure and investment continued to be directed to the south. Current investment
patterns essentially mirror those of the 1990s, although
more public expenditure and investment have started
ﬂowing to the north as a result of funding from the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, which beneﬁts
the north disproportionately.20
Data conﬁrm the regional inequalities outlined above.
In 1960, the north had only 17 per cent of the gross value
added per capita of the Greater Accra region. The north
remained much poorer in terms of income, infrastructure,
education and medical services in the 1970s. According
to one composite measure of development,21 the northern
and upper regions had levels of development equivalent to
only 11 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, of the level
found in the Greater Accra region in the mid-1970s. Other
indicators, including school enrolment, infant mortality
and share of income, also show the persistence of a sharp
north-south divide.22 Though the north appeared to have
caught up with the south in terms of literacy and infant
mortality in the 1990s (see table 3.1), the north-south
divide actually worsened considerably with respect to poverty incidence and income. Increased public expenditure
in the north has been positive, as illustrated by the decline
in poverty between 1998/1999 and 2005/2006. But despite
recent improvements, north-south disparities remain
severe. Because the Mole-Dagbani are dominant demographically in the north and the vast majority of them live
in those regions, the inequalities between northern and
southern ethnic groups largely mirror north-south inequalities. This is captured by a number of indicators, as shown
in table 3.2.

Though the north appeared to have
caught up with the south in terms
of literacy and infant mortality,
the divide worsened with respect
to poverty incidence

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Côte d’Ivoire. Côte d’Ivoire shares similar characteristics
with Ghana. The country’s 20 million people are divided
into 70 ethnicities, which are usually clustered into ﬁve
groups. The Akan form the largest cluster with about 42 per
cent of the population and are located predominantly in the
eastern and central parts of the country. The southwest is
predominantly inhabited by the Krou, who constitute about
13 per cent of the population. The Southern Mandé are
largely in the west and constitute about 10 per cent of the
population. The Voltaic and Northern Mandé are dominant
in the north and together account for about 34 per cent
of the population. Importantly, while the northern groups
constitute the vast majority of the Ivorian population in the
northern regions (72 per cent), 44 per cent of them live in
the south due to extensive internal migration. Côte d’Ivoire
has a large proportion of foreigners, accounting for about 26
per cent of the population in 1998. Because most of these
foreigners originate from Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea,
they share important cultural and religious traditions with
northern Ivorians. Christians form the largest group, with
about 34 per cent of the population, and Muslims with
about 28 per cent. However, as the vast majority of nonIvorians are Muslim (about 70 per cent), they tilt the balance in favour of Muslims. While the Akan and Krou are
predominantly Christian, Voltaic and Northern Mandé are
mostly Muslim. Although the north is predominantly Muslim, about 70 per cent of all Muslims live in the south.
Like Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire is characterized by a serious
north-south divide, which stems from ecological and climatic differences and the varying impact of colonialism and
post-colonial development policies. The colonial power,
France, supported the rapid expansion in the southern
and southeastern parts of the country of the production for
export of coffee and cocoa. The post-colonial government
of Félix Houphouët-Boigny maintained the export-oriented agricultural model. While the development strategy
produced impressive results, the concentration of investment, jobs and wealth in the southern parts of the country
exacerbated the disparities between the north and south.
Starting in the late 1960s, however, the Ivorian government began promoting commercial food production in

90

the north in order to reduce food imports. An increasing
amount of government expenditure and investment went
to the north, which moderately reduced regional inequalities. Houphouët-Boigny actively encouraged internal
north-south as well as international migration through
his land policy, which was based on the slogan, “The land
belongs to those who develop it” (La terre appartient à
celui qui la met en valeur). Many northerners migrated to
the cocoa and coffee plantations in the south. Yet while
regional income inequalities were reduced between 1965
and 1975, they nonetheless remained severe, which threatened political stability. In response, the government initiated the Programme du Nord, a massive public investment
scheme, to reduce inequalities.23 With the deteriorating
economic situation at the end of the 1970s, however, public investment in the north dried up. The sharp decline in
coffee and cocoa prices triggered a serious economic crisis
and the adoption of structural adjustment policies. Because
the negative impact of the recession on expenditures was
considerably larger in southern regions, the regional divide
improved somewhat in relative terms. Nonetheless, it
appears that the war and the subsequent split of the country between a rebel-controlled north and a governmentcontrolled south in 2002 have more adversely affected the
social and economic situation of the north.

Côte d’Ivoire’s north-south divide
stems from ecological and climatic
differences and the impact of
colonialism and post-colonial
development policies

Regional income inequalities at independence were indeed
quite severe. Income per capita (including non-monetary
income) in Abidjan in 1965 was 11 times higher than in
the north; the northern regions were also doing considerably worse compared to other parts of the country. Income
per capita in the central part of the country was 1.9 times
higher than the north; in southern regions it was 2.6 times

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 3 – TACKLING ETHNIC AND REGIONAL INEQUALITIES

higher. If only cash income is taken into account, the
northern disadvantage was even more pronounced: monetary income per capita in Abidjan, central and southern
regions was 37, 4.5 and 7 times higher, respectively, than in
the north. Similarly, educational differences between the
north and south, as well as between the south and west,
were also severe in 1967–1969. The north had a primary
school enrolment rate of 14.9 per cent in 1967 versus a rate
of 55.3 per cent in the south, 32 per cent in the centre,
35.5 per cent in the centre-west area, 33.1 per cent in
Abidjan, and 13.3 per cent in the west.24
As a result of increased public investment and government expenditure in the northern regions starting in the
late 1960s, the north-south divide diminished considerably
between 1965 and 1975, as shown in table 3.3. Yet while
income inequalities between the two regions were reduced
during that period, the north continued to be seriously

disadvantaged. In 1975, per capita income in the north
was still about 22 per cent less than the national average
and 65 per cent less than in Abidjan. The drying-up of
funds for the Programme du Nord worsened the inequalities. In 1985, the mean expenditure per capita in the north
was about 50 per cent below the national average. Mean
expenditure data for 1985 suggest that although the Voltaic
and Northern Mandé had the lowest mean expenditure per
capita (244,000 and 338,900 CFA francs, respectively), the
difference between these two northern ethnic groups and
the national average (350,000 CFA francs) was considerably less than the differences between the national average
and the northern regions.25 This suggests that northerners
who migrated from the north to the south or were born in
the south were doing signiﬁcantly better than the people in
the northern regions themselves. All three southern ethnic
groups had a mean expenditure per capita that was well
above the national average.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Table 3.4 provides a number of other indicators for
1994–2005, drawn from the DHS. While the inequalities
between the northern (Northern Mandé and Voltaic) and
southern (Akan, Krou and Southern Mandé) ethnic groups
in terms of educational attainment largely mirrored northsouth inequalities, ethnic inequalities showed a somewhat
different picture with respect to the other three indicators.

More speciﬁcally, the Northern Mandé appeared to be
doing roughly the same or even better in terms of electricity, a ﬂush toilet or piped water in their home than the
three southern ethnic groups. The main reason for this is
that the Northern Mandé are more likely to live in urban
areas than the other ethnic groups, since trade is their
primary economic activity.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 3 – TACKLING ETHNIC AND REGIONAL INEQUALITIES

This comparison points to a number of conclusions. First,
in agrarian economies such as Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire,
climatic differences that predispose certain regions to better crop production than others are a major obstacle to
balanced growth, especially in the absence of redistributive policies. Moreover, structural adjustment programmes
(SAPs) that emphasize investment in tradable sectors exacerbate these disparities. However, where governments have
undertaken programmes to address underdevelopment in
relatively deprived regions – in Côte d’Ivoire in the 1960s
and in Ghana in more recent years – these can have a relatively rapid and positive impact on well-being.

In agrarian economies,
government programmes to address
underdevelopment in deprived regions
can have a rapid and positive impact

Industrializing economies
Chapter 1 has shown that a small number of developing
countries or areas have recently undergone a pattern of
industrialization in which industrial employment increased
substantially. Average living standards rose, dramatically
reducing poverty. While the most successful of these – Hong
Kong, China, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province
of China – are relatively homogenous ethnically, others –
such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand – are
multi-ethnic. Poverty and inequality may not only assume
ethnic dimensions, but can undermine rapid growth and
structural change without appropriate policies that address
ethnic or regional divisions. The experience of Malaysia
and Indonesia illustrates this argument.
Malaysia. Among all the Southeast Asian countries,
Malaysia ranks second highest in terms of development
(after Singapore), but highest in terms of income inequality. With a Gini coefﬁcient of 0.49,26 Malaysia also has

high inequality in terms of its human development beyond
the Southeast Asia region. Among countries of comparable human development, only the Latin American country of Panama has higher income inequality. However,
regional inequality in Malaysia is the second lowest in
Southeast Asia – surpassed only by the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Inequality and its remediation have been
at the heart of Malaysian economic policy since 1969 –
not regional or vertical income inequality, however, but
ethnic inequality.
The early years of Malaysia’s independence were marked by
severe social and economic disparities between the majority Malays and other indigenous groups (together termed
the Bumiputera) – who tended to be poor, rural subsistence
farmers – and the minority Chinese community, which
dominated the national economy. The other major immigrant community was Indian. This group was more diverse,
with many relatively well-off Indians in the civil service,
but a signiﬁcant proportion of the poor working in the
rubber plantations.
The policy that ushered in the great industrial and social
transformation after ethnic riots in 1969 had two objectives: reducing ethnic inequalities and eliminating poverty,
regardless of ethnicity. The export-oriented growth strategy supported labour-intensive manufacture of textiles,
garments and electronics, which absorbed a large number
of unskilled ethnic Malays from the rural areas into the
formal industrial sector.27 However, unlike the Republic of
Korea and Taiwan Province of China, where domestic capital acted as the vanguard for industrial development, the
Malaysian government preferred foreign direct investment
(FDI) since it was initially wary of promoting domestic
capital, which was fractured along ethnic lines. Afﬁrmative
action, an ethnic coalition pact and interventionist industrial policies were pursued.
To reduce ethnic inequalities, the government systematically used ethnic quotas and targets to regulate access to
state assistance, business opportunities, tertiary education
and civil service recruitment – primarily in favour of ethnic
Malays.28 The ethnic pact involved power sharing at the

elite level by the leading parties of the three main ethnic
groups. The pact preserved the position of Chinese capital and largely ceded control of the state to the Malays.
Implemented in a context of sustained high rates of growth,
afﬁrmative action and industrial strategies reconﬁgured
the ethnic structure and allowed the state to later support
large domestic conglomerates through privatization of state
assets. Whereas most Malaysians earned their living from
agriculture in the 1960s, by 2000 the share had dropped to
only 16 per cent. Manufacturing employment expanded in
leaps and bounds – from 7 per cent in the 1960s to about
28 per cent in 2000. While many of the New Economic
Policy’s ambitious targets were not quite met, the period
saw a drastic decrease in ethnic imbalances.

Inequality index (GCov)

The Malaysian government frequently releases summary
data on ethnic inequalities across a variety of dimensions
– including income, employment and poverty – although
the raw data of household income surveys are closely
guarded. These data are often reported in academic studies, either as absolute averages or as dispersion ratios.29 It is
possible to condense these ratios into an overall index
of ethnic inequality. Figure 3.4A demonstrates this using
three measures of horizontal inequality calculated for the
three main ethnic groups – Malay/Bumiputera, Chinese and
Indian – and a small fourth group (Other). Also reported is
the bare Chinese-Bumiputera dispersion ratio (C:B Ratio),
which is the ratio between the two largest and most politically important groups. All measures are indexed to their
1970 value for ease of comparison. Between 1979 and
1984, the data on which these ﬁgures are based referred
only to West Malaysia, without including the states of
Sabah and Sarawak, a break represented by the dashed
section of each curve.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 3 – TACKLING ETHNIC AND REGIONAL INEQUALITIES

The three composite measures of horizontal inequality are
highly correlated across time. They all show a signiﬁcant
drop in horizontal inequality between the mid-1970s and
the mid-1980s – a period associated with the full implementation of the New Economic Policy, from the passing of
the Industrial Coordination Act in 1976 to the loosening of
the New Economic Policy by the Mahathir administration
following the 1986 recession. This decrease is also reﬂected
in the Chinese-Bumiputera dispersion ratio, although not
as strongly. From the mid-1980s, however, the composite
indices show a broadly ﬂat trend with only minor variations
up and down, while the Chinese-Bumiputera dispersion
ratio has been steadily increasing again, with the exception
of the period 1995–1999.
Two regions stand out in terms of regional inequality:
the eastern Malaysian states of Sarawak and Sabah, and
the northern, Malay-dominated states of Kelantan and
Terengganu. Populated largely by the non-Malay Bumiputera groups, Sarawak and Sabah have failed to beneﬁt
signiﬁcantly from the pro-Bumiputera policies of the New
Economic Policy. Similarly, Kelantan and Terengganu,
even though Malay, continue to lag behind, with poverty
rates about twice the national average. Figure 3.4B shows
the absolute changes in regional and ethnic inequality
since 1970.

education and, hence, occupation. The record is less
striking in income – speciﬁcally inter-ethnic income –
restructuring. Mean incomes have risen considerably for
all groups. Although inter-ethnic gaps at the mean have
narrowed, they have narrowed much less than in the nonincome measures of health and education.31 However, it is
a signiﬁcant achievement that income inequality has been
reduced to around 25 per cent for Chinese-Malay disparity,
and to zero for Indian-Malay disparity.32
Overall inter-group disparities may have remained steady
relative to each other, but have declined substantially in
absolute terms. To give some indication of this, ﬁgure 3.5
charts changes in the infant mortality rate by ethnic group
since 1945. While the ratio of performance has remained
broadly steady – with both Indian and Malay groups experiencing an infant mortality rate that is about 50 per cent
higher than the Chinese over the entire period – the absolute level has declined drastically.

Overall, Malaysia has made huge strides in human development. In the course of a generation, it has succeeded
in lifting all groups and reducing the gaps between them
in the areas of health, education, occupation and industry.30 This has not been even, with the minority indigenous communities generally falling behind with regard to

As already discussed, ethnic inequalities diminished
rapidly before ﬂattening out in the mid-1980s. In contrast,
changes in regional inequalities have been less consistent,
but the trend is clearly upwards. In 1970, inequality among
ethnic groups was about one-third higher than that among
Malaysian states; today, the reverse is true, with regional
inequalities more than 40 per cent higher than ethnic
inequalities. This suggests that intra-ethnic inequalities
may have risen.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Inter-group disparities in Malaysia may
have remained steady relative to each
other, but have declined substantially
in absolute terms

Indonesia. In Indonesia, public policy has focused on
regional inequalities. Since independence in 1950, the
country has been beset by regional and ethnic problems,
partly due to the fact of its geographic spread across some
2,000 islands. Ethnic diversity is extremely high, rendering attempts to quantify ethnic inequality problematic.
According to the 2000 census and the 2002 household
survey (National Socioeconomic Survey/SUSENAS), the
largest group are the Javanese, who account for just under
half the population. The second largest group (18 per cent)
are the Sundanese, who also originate from Java. Besides
these two large groups, no other group constitutes more
than 6 per cent of the population.

money to less wealthy provinces and districts. Indonesia
now ranks as among the most ﬁscally decentralized countries in the world.
Figure 3.6 tracks the level of regional inequality in Indonesia since 1975. A previous data series (not graphed)
showed an initial spike in the level of regional inequality in the early 1970s, which is largely attributable to the
discovery and exploitation of natural resources in Aceh,
Riau and Papua, which saw their respective gross regional
domestic product per capita accelerate signiﬁcantly. The
subsequent decline in provincial inequalities conﬁrms the
standard interpretation that, while in many ways corrupt,
the Suharto regime was relatively redistributive in its management of natural resource revenues, particularly through
the INPRES (Presidential Instructions) system of regional
disbursements.34

Indonesia followed an export-oriented growth strategy,
driven by FDI and buoyed by signiﬁcant oil revenues.
Poverty alleviation has been signiﬁcant, although not as
successful as in Malaysia. Poverty rates have declined from
an estimated 53.6 per cent in urban areas and 38.7 per
cent in rural areas in 1970 to 9.7 per cent and 12.3 per
cent, respectively, in 1996.33 After 1998, Indonesia instituted a radical decentralization programme, including the
introduction of a mandatory equalization formula through
which the central government is obliged to disperse more

Since democratization and decentralization at the end of
the 1990s, however, regional inequalities have increased
noticeably. Analysis of household expenditure shows that

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 3 – TACKLING ETHNIC AND REGIONAL INEQUALITIES

while overall inequality declined between 1990 and 1999,
the proportion of this inequality accounted for by differences among provinces increased from 13 per cent to
21 per cent.35 The politics of resource wealth distribution
and service delivery was particularly marked in those
provinces with high natural resources but, from Jakarta’s
perspective, dubious political loyalties – either due to
their military incorporation into the country, as in West
Papua and East Timor, or because of their history of rebellion, as in Aceh. The politics of resource distribution
assumed a cycle of rebellion, negative social and economic effects, and thus further rebellion. Poverty in Aceh
increased by 239 per cent from 1980 to 2002; over the same
period, poverty in Indonesia as a whole fell by 47 per cent.
By 2000, Aceh’s gross regional domestic product had risen
to fourth out of 30 provinces, largely due to income from
natural resources, but its poverty rank had also increased
to ﬁfth from 28th.
Tracking ethnic inequalities in Indonesia is difﬁcult
because the ethnic make-up of the country is so diverse
and because the state prohibited collection of such data for
long periods of time. However, insights into the dynamics
of ethnic inequality can be obtained through an examination of the impact of migration. Under Suharto, appointments to positions of local power by the central state in
Jakarta resulted in increasing political dominance of the
Javanese. In addition, the massive state-sponsored transmigration programme and associated informal migration was
a key source of social exclusion and horizontal inequalities
on the outer islands.

Figure 3.7 shows the average income of migrants relative to
non-migrants by province. In every province, the overall
average income of migrants was signiﬁcantly higher than
that of non-migrants. In some provinces, local-born residents retained an income advantage in rural areas – notably
provinces in the southern part of Sumatra, which received
relatively fewer transmigrants. However, in urban areas,
migrants held an income advantage in all provinces except
central Kalimantan. Moreover, as ﬁgure 3.8 shows, the disparity between migrants and local residents is considerably
greater in poorer provinces.

This comparison of Malaysia and Indonesia points to
a number of conclusions. First, redistributive policies –
whether primarily ethnically oriented, as in Malaysia, or
regionally oriented, as in Indonesia – are not incompatible with rapid growth. Second, signiﬁcant improvements
in basic human development indicators can be achieved
across multiple dimensions of horizontal inequality (as
also conﬁrmed by the evidence cited above for Ghana and
Côte d’Ivoire). But the ﬁnal note is one of caution: where
policies target one dimension of horizontal inequality, this
may not translate into a reduction – and indeed may even
be accompanied by an increase – in another dimension of
horizontal inequality, even when the demographics of these
two dimensions are largely overlapping.

As reported in chapter 1, many middle-income countries
have made important strides in industrialization, but have
been less successful in incorporating large segments of their
population into the development process. In situations
where the majority of the population is indigenous, as in
South Africa, an ethnically segregated policy guided development and made it difﬁcult for the majority black population to beneﬁt from development. In Brazil, non-white
groups are also disadvantaged, even though there is no
explicit regime of separate development. In Mexico, efforts
were made to incorporate the largely indigenous peasantry
through land reform after the revolution of 1910 and the
birth of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. However,
the relationship was based on patronage and, after 1940,
the dualist agrarian structure re-emerged as peasant farmers
lost control of land they legally owned.36

Brazil. The population of Brazil, like much of Latin America, is characterized by a large degree of ethnic mixing, with
most people tracing some degree of mixed heritage from
white settlers, black descendants of slaves and indigenous
groups. Since 1950, the Brazilian census has distinguished
ﬁve population groups – bronco (white), preto (black),
pardo (brown, or mixed descent), indígino (indigenous) and
amarelo (East Asian). In the latest census, a slight majority
of the population identiﬁed themselves as white, around
a third as brown, about 7 per cent as black, and less than
1 per cent as Asian. As ﬁgure 3.9 indicates, there is a strong
overlap between geography and ethnicity, and between
geography and social and economic performance.

Brazil followed an import-substitution policy for much of its
independence period. Its economy was heavily reliant on
coffee, making it vulnerable to price ﬂuctuations. Import
substitution only started to deliver rapid industrialization
in the 1940s; between 1950 and 1975, the economy grew at
around 7 per cent per year. By the 1980s, however, increasing debt and oil shocks led to stagﬂation – the lost decade
in which GDP per capita growth slowed to 1.4 per cent and
real incomes shrank by 6 per cent. Brazil re-democratized
in 1988 with a new constitution that radically altered the
political economy, implementing substantial ﬁscal decentralization to the state level and mandating educational and
other social and economic priorities. Subsequently, facing
a hyperinﬂationary threat, the administration of Fernando
Collor de Mello began a process of trade liberalization and
privatization. It was only after the Real Plan of 1994 pegged
the Brazilian real to the US dollar, however, that inﬂationary pressures were brought under control. Despite fears that
he would renege on debt repayments and undo the monetary restraint of the previous decade, President Luiz Inácio
Lula da Silva, in power since 2002, has overseen a continuous, though modest, era of growth.
Brazil is a country of high regional and ethnic inequalities, which have remained remarkably steady over the long
term. The mean income of black and brown (or pardo, as
in ﬁgure 3.11) households is only half that of whites. In
fact, black and brown households account for 66 per cent of
poor households, even though they account for 48 per cent
of the population.37
The drop in regional inequalities starting in the late 1980s
(see ﬁgure 3.10) followed major decentralization initiatives, higher growth rates in the majority of states in
the poor northeastern region, a signiﬁcant real growth of
the national minimum wage, and pursuit of wide-ranging
social assistance schemes that beneﬁted the poorest states.38
The per capita value of government transfers was much
higher in the poorer states than in the richer ones.39

In 1980, when employment levels were at their highest,
there was little difference among ethnic groups. Indeed, the
brown employment rate at 90.7 per cent was slightly higher
than that of whites (89.3 per cent), with the black employment rate at 89.5 per cent. As employment rates fell over
the subsequent two census periods, however, white employment rates fell much less severely; between 1990 and 2000,
the white male employment rate fell by less than eight percentage points, whereas the equivalent fall for both black
and brown groups was around 14 per cent.
Figure 3.11 traces changes in literacy rates of the four main

the four groups have narrowed for those below 40 years of
age, they remain high for older individuals.

Mexico. Like Brazil, Mexico is characterized by relatively ﬂuid
ethnic boundaries between whites, mestizos and indigenous
peoples. Unlike Brazil, however, Mexico does not have a substantial population of African descent. The ability to speak
an indigenous language is often taken as a proxy for ethnicity. By 2000, 9.3 per cent claimed to speak both Spanish and
an indigenous language; 2.5 per cent said they spoke only an
indigenous language; and 88.3 per cent reported that they do
not speak any indigenous language. The geographic distribution of indigenous groups is highly concentrated, however,
with over 60 per cent of indigenous-language speakers living
in the four southern states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz and
Yucatán. Moreover, indigenous speakers do not constitute a
clear majority in any state, although in Chiapas, Oaxaca and
Yucatán they constitute about half the population.
Like Brazil, Mexico’s early development trajectory was marked
by severe and increasing social inequalities, which gave rise to
political unrest. The Porﬁriato period between 1876 and 1911,
named after Porﬁrio Díaz, who was president of the country
for all but four of those years, was marked by considerable
economic growth driven by an open policy towards foreign
investment. This growth was unbalanced, however, with the
northern regions neighbouring the United States and home

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 3 – TACKLING ETHNIC AND REGIONAL INEQUALITIES

to most of the country’s natural resources the primary beneﬁciaries. These inequalities were a major driving factor in the
descent into political instability and intermittent civil war,
which ultimately brought the Institutional Revolutionary
Party to power in the late 1920s. Badly affected by the depression of the 1930s, it was only after the Second World War that
Mexico resumed sustained economic growth through a successful policy of import substitution, leading to the Mexican
miracle that saw sustained growth and industrialization until
the end of the 1960s. Like Brazil, Mexico’s economy entered a
period of stagﬂation in the 1980s, with minimal GDP growth
and high inﬂation between 1982 and 1988. Mexico began
instituting liberalization policies in 1988, culminating in the
ratiﬁcation of NAFTA in 1994.
Mexico has exhibited a consistent upward trend in regional
inequalities (ﬁgure 3.12). All states with signiﬁcant indigenous populations began the period with per capita GDP well
below the national average, which, for the most part, remained
broadly steady over subsequent years, with two notable exceptions: Quintana Roo and Campeche. Both of these states experienced rapid growth over the period relative to the national
average and are now well above average in terms of GDP per
capita. Along with Tabasco, Campeche is home to most of
Mexico’s oil and gas resources, while Quintana Roo, on the
Yucatán Peninsula, has beneﬁted primarily from tourism centred on its Mayan archaeological sites, which now accounts
for around 50 per cent of gross regional domestic product.

Figures 3.13 and 3.14 show the literacy rate and average
years of schooling among indigenous and non-indigenous
groups in the 2000 census, broken down by age. Though
all groups have made signiﬁcant advances over time, there
is a noticeable difference in the rates of catch-up among
indigenous groups. Among non-indigenous people below
the age of 40, full literacy has been more or less achieved.
And while indigenous people in this age group lag behind,
younger age cohorts are catching up such that equal
levels of literacy can be expected in the near future, based
on these trends.
In contrast, though average years of education are also
rising in both groups, the absolute gap in years of education was actually increasing among older people. For
those under age 50 or so, the gap has remained relatively
constant with non-indigenous groups having an advantage of around three years of education within each age
cohort, even as overall levels rise in both groups among
younger cohorts.

The absence of good income data makes tracking changes
in ethnic inequalities difﬁcult. In 1970, more than threequarters of indigenous people were agricultural workers.
By 1990, this share had diminished to about 60 per cent,
but this ﬁgure barely shifted in the decade of liberalization, remaining around 60 per cent in 2000. In 1990, the
ratio of indigenous people in the skilled and semi-skilled
occupational categories relative to their proportion in
the workforce as a whole was 0.39 – a marked increase on
the respective ratio in 1970 (0.28) and, indeed, higher
than in 2000 (0.36). In other words, since 1990, there have
been only about a third the number of indigenous people in
skilled and semi-skilled occupations than we would expect
to see if employment were distributed proportionately.
While the indigenous have maintained an apparent overall
advantage in terms of employment rates, this has largely
been due to their concentration in the rural agricultural
sector, a phenomenon that liberalization has done little
to change.

In both Brazil and Mexico, the era of liberalization was
accompanied by three major trends: decentralization, trade
liberalization and privatization. Trade liberalization is typically seen to exacerbate regional inequality, and Mexico
largely conforms to this trend. However, Brazil appears to
provide counter-evidence to this pattern because of the
higher growth rates experienced in the majority of poor
states, increases in the national minimum wage, and the
large-scale social assistance schemes (see chapter 5) that
disproportionately beneﬁted the poorest states. Both countries have also made signiﬁcant advances in basic human
development indicators irrespective of ethnicity and state,
but have struggled to translate this into similar reductions
in income inequality. It is too early to tell whether or not
the recent afﬁrmative action programmes for black Brazilians will make any inroads into this disparity.

ⴑ Difference

Ethnic inequalities appear to be a universal feature of
multiethnic developing countries, and are much more difﬁcult to address than regional inequalities. The persistence
of ethnic inequalities may be due to discriminatory public
policies, the way labour markets are structured, and differential access to governance institutions. Labour markets
may be ethnically segmented because of past public policies, unequal development, or efforts by individuals from
speciﬁc groups to protect advantages in certain lines of
activity. Public policies and market segmentation may lead
to physical segregation of groups, further reinforcing ethnic
prejudice and antagonism.
Inequalities can also arise from the effects of development
policies and practices on different groups. When ethnicity
overlaps with social class, inequalities may assume hierarchical ethnic-class dimensions of the types that may breed
xenophobia and violence. Such inequalities may mask other
cleavages by creating an ethnically divided society. Many

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 3 – TACKLING ETHNIC AND REGIONAL INEQUALITIES

forms of ethnic inequalities are, however, ambiguous. Individuals in an assumed ethnic group may, for instance, rank
well in social and economic terms but the ethnic group may
be disadvantaged nationally. Inequalities may occur in education, health provisioning, housing, income, employment,
infrastructure development and asset holdings, such as land.
Ethnicity may become a powerful tool in the hands of elites
and politicians in struggles over public ofﬁce and resources.40
Ethnic inequalities are not just a problem in poor countries.
Studies of advanced industrial societies41 also report high
levels of inequality between immigrant and indigenous
groups that encompass various social and economic dimensions. Sharp inequalities also exist among groups with a
long history of residence in some rich multi-ethnic countries, such as the United States.42
Failure to reduce horizontal inequalities can have political consequences. The articulation of extreme views on the
causes of and solutions to group grievances can, and does,
lead to violence or civil war, inhibit growth and make poverty reduction more difﬁcult. The proportion of conﬂicts
identiﬁed as ethnic increased from 15 per cent in 1953 to
nearly 60 per cent in 2005.43
This concluding section presents some direct and indirect policies for correcting horizontal inequalities. Direct
approaches, often referred to as afﬁrmative action, involve
targeting groups. Indirect approaches aim to achieve the
same outcome via universal policies.44

Afﬁrmative action is best pursued as part
of a larger framework
Afﬁrmative action has been implemented in various guises
in countries as diverse as Namibia and the United States,
in some cases for disadvantaged majorities (as in Malaysia
and post-apartheid South Africa), but more often for disadvantaged minorities (as in Brazil, India and the United
States). Critics contend that afﬁrmative action imposes
heavy costs on the economy, through what are perceived
as market distortions.45 However, it is instructive to note

that in many cases the policies that generated the need for
afﬁrmative action were more distortionary and exclusionary than afﬁrmative action policies themselves; and the
persistence of ethnic inequalities may affect the welfare of
disadvantaged groups and deprive society of the full utilization of the capabilities of all citizens.
The effects of afﬁrmative action on economic growth vary
widely from country to country and across different types of
policy. Malaysia’s phenomenal growth over the past three
decades suggests that afﬁrmative action is not inherently
detrimental to growth. Moreover, there is evidence from
South Africa that efﬁciency gains may have resulted from
such policies.46
The Brazil case shows that the majority of the poor northeastern states with a large percentage of minorities beneﬁted disproportionately from social assistance programmes
and have recently registered high growth rates. In Northern Ireland, the elimination or reduction of inequalities
between Protestants and Catholics in higher education,
housing, employment and recruitment to the police force
contributed to the willingness of the Catholic community
to support the peace process,47 which provided a foundation for economic growth.
While improving horizontal inequalities, afﬁrmative action
in some cases can worsen intra-group (and overall) vertical inequality. This depends on whether policies target
the lower or upper end of the income distribution curve.
In India, the marginalized Dalit group has received both
preferential access to universities and subsidies in tuition
and housing. While these policies have improved the social
and economic status of Dalits, many group reservations go
unclaimed because deﬁcient primary and secondary schooling prevents students from meeting even relaxed requirements. Ultimately, inadequate primary education and an
overemphasis on tertiary education beneﬁted the middle
class, exacerbating class inequalities.48
In Malaysia, however, youths of the targeted group were
sent to well-equipped residential schools and then provided
with preferential access to tertiary education. Beneﬁciaries

103

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

have now emerged as the new middle class. Policies targeted both capital ownership at the upper end of the income
distribution (by compelling ﬁrms to distribute shares to
disadvantaged Malays), and poverty eradication and educational and employment opportunities at the lower end.
As a result, intra-group income distribution improved or at
least did not worsen initially. Later approaches, which have
focused on the upper end of the distribution curve, worsened intra-group inequality. Similarly, policies in South
Africa have had most effect at the upper end of the distribution curve, and intra-group distribution has worsened.49
Afﬁrmative action works best when pursued within a larger
framework that seeks to incorporate all citizens in national
development and welfare provision. It is easier to reduce
inequalities if an economy is growing, the disadvantaged
population enjoys access to policy-making institutions, and
the redistributive policy is part of a wider strategy that seeks
to transform the economy and eliminate poverty irrespective of ethnic origin, as in Malaysia.
Redistributive policies may be controversial when economies
are in recession, the policies do not have time limits, and fundamental inequalities, especially in education, are widening
despite redistribution. This may give rise to feelings of frustration on the part of those who think they are better qualiﬁed than members of the targeted group.50 Redistributive
policies that depend on the choices of majority groups may
be unsustainable if the majority public turns against them,
as appears to be happening in the United States.

104

Universal programmes may not be enough
Universal programmes that aim to reduce poverty irrespective
of ethnicity can be considered indirect policies. If successful,
they will improve the position of disadvantaged groups. Some
empirical evidence51 suggests that when speciﬁc groups suffer from multiple deprivations in human, physical and social
capital, universal programmes alone may be unable to reach
them effectively since improvement in one dimension will
have little impact on the overall level of deprivation. Thus,
for instance, one study52 ﬁnds differential returns on education among indigenous and non-indigenous groups in Peru.
When indigenous people obtain education levels on par with
non-indigenous groups, their returns to education are lower.
Some differential returns can be explained in terms of discrimination either in the workplace or in government policy.
In some cases, stringent antidiscrimination legislation can be
effective, since such policies do not speciﬁcally identify particular groups for positive action, but rather prevent negative
action against any group. Such antidiscrimination legislation
was a cornerstone of attempts in the United Kingdom/European Union to redress the deprivation of Catholics in Northern Ireland from the 1980s onwards. These efforts were met
with broad success, with unemployment differentials between
Catholic and non-Catholic groups declining markedly in the
decade running up to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.53
Another indirect approach to reducing horizontal inequalities, particularly in countries where ethnic groups are regionally concentrated, is to pursue a strategy of balanced regional
development, rather than targeting speciﬁc groups directly.
Such indirect strategies have been adopted in Ghana in the
context of disbursing funds from the HIPC debt relief initiative. Indonesia under Suharto likewise followed a regional
development strategy. However, Indonesia’s experience with
regional development has arguably been less successful in
reducing ethnic tensions. Regional development strategies
may have reduced disparities among provinces, but there
is evidence that they may also have heightened ethnic
inequalities within provinces, particularly in rural areas
where the main beneﬁciaries of development have often
been the largely Javanese migrant population.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 3 – TACKLING ETHNIC AND REGIONAL INEQUALITIES

Political and cultural inclusivity is key to
action for disadvantaged groups

parties to gain some representation in parliament, the government and the civil service.

Correcting horizontal inequalities requires sensitivity
to ethnic differences and is, in the ﬁnal analysis, political. Without political inclusivity, there is little chance
of implementing effective remedial policies for disadvantaged groups. Social and economic inequalities are also
often intertwined with cultural exclusion. This is particularly important in relation to the cultural identity of the
state – whether it embodies exclusion or subordination of
practices associated with certain cultural groups, or reﬂects
a cultural inclusivity that places equal value and visibility on the practices of all groups. Alternatively, the state
can aspire to an acultural status or civic republicanism.
However, this may turn out to be assimilationist, with the
dominant culture enjoying supremacy over other cultures.
Rectifying cultural status inequalities is often a matter of
recognition rather than redistribution. The three main
areas of cultural status policies relate to religious practices
and observances, language and language recognition, and
recognition of ethno-cultural practices.

Evidence in multi-ethnic societies suggests that majoritarian policies and power-sharing arrangements do not always
pull in opposite directions.56 The majority of ethnically
segmented countries, like their more homogenous counterparts, have majoritarian institutions. But ethnic problems
have forced some of them to incorporate power-sharing
elements. Formal consociational arrangements may not be
relevant in ethnic settings where one group enjoys an overwhelming numerical majority, or in highly fragmented societies that lack a dominant group and where governments
are bound to be ethnically inclusive under democratic conditions. On the other hand, they are usually unavoidable in
societies where only two or three groups exist, or where two
or three dominant groups coexist with smaller groups in a
multi-ethnic setting, as well as in multi-polar settings with
strong ethnic or regional clusters.57 Even in these cases of
ethnic polarization, parties may still be multi-ethnic, as in
Switzerland,58 rather than ethnic, as in Belgium.59

Two competing frameworks can be used for managing diversity and ensuring political inclusivity at the central level of
government: (i) reforms that seek to promote large majorities by encouraging vote pooling, ethnic integration and
moderation, while also supporting adversarial politics;54
and (ii) consociational or power-sharing arrangements that
accommodate ethnic divisions.55
The ﬁrst type of reform (majoritarian) promotes plurality
within party systems by encouraging political actors to seek
votes outside of their ethnic strongholds if they are to gain
the second, third or subsequent preferences of voters in the
preference vote system that underpins this framework. The
second type of reform – consociation or power-sharing –
accepts ethnic-based parties as given and seeks to promote
plurality, not within the contending parties, but at the governmental level itself. It is grounded in the voting system of
proportional representation, which may encourage all key
segments in society to be sharply deﬁned so that groups that
feel alienated from the political process may form their own

The crafting of institutions that are sensitive to, but not
trapped by, ethnic cleavages is a challenge for policy makers in pluralistic societies. It is always important to bear in
mind that ethnicity is only one form of identiﬁcation and
that ethnic identities can be ﬂuid. Countries should avoid
reforms that make it difﬁcult for individuals to express
other identities. Institutional reforms should, therefore, be
based on sound principles of universal citizenship where
individuals are free to settle and take up employment anywhere in the national territory, and where a common set of
citizenship rights applies to everyone. Efforts should also be
made to promote institutions that are likely to cut across
ethnic cleavages and defend national, as opposed to narrow
ethnic, interests. Such institutions include trade unions,
professional associations and other civic organizations.
These initiatives are important in ensuring that ethnic
politicians do not capture governance reforms that serve
to play up ethnic cleavages, and that they are also sensitive to the wider goal of building a pluralistic state that can
promote development and deliver services to all citizens
without discrimination.

CHAPTER

Gender Inequalities at
Home and in the Market
Inequalities of income and wealth (vertical inequalities)
may hide signiﬁcant differences among social groups. One
key dimension of such inequality is gender: women tend
to be disadvantaged vis-à-vis men in most spheres, including the labour market. Like ethnic and racial inequalities
(discussed in chapter 3), gender inequalities are complex.
They are reﬂected in the political and economic structures
of a country (including its labour markets), which generate
speciﬁc types of exploitation and material deprivation. But
they also reﬂect the way society is structured in terms of
cultural values and social norms that are embedded across
a wide spectrum of institutions in both private and public
life. Inequalities in these areas can lead to the misrepresentation and devaluation of women, subjecting them to
discrimination, exclusion and violence.1
Over the past two to three decades, signiﬁcant changes
have occurred in the social and economic status of women
that have helped reduce gender inequalities. Such changes
in women’s lives are associated with the social transformations that accompany economic development. But they are
not simply a by-product of economic growth. Indicators of
well-being across Indian states, including child sex ratios,2
reveal a troubling and complex relationship between economic growth and gender inequality. In north Indian states
that have seen dramatic agricultural growth, for example,
indicators of gender equality are worsening. According to
a number of recent studies, economic development and
the associated accumulation of wealth seem to have lowered girls’ life chances also in the southern state of Tamil
Nadu, which has historically been more gender equal.3
Sex-ratio imbalances have also deepened in China, where
the one-child policy has combined with strong son preference to diminish a female’s chances of survival because of
sex-selective abortions and post-birth neglect.4 China and
India account for nearly 80 per cent of all “missing women”5
in the world. The fact that these two countries have also

4

produced some of the fastest rates of economic growth over
the past decade or so only underscores the point that there
is no guarantee that growth will enhance gender equality.
In fact, some patterns of growth and structural change are
premised on, and reinforce, gender inequalities.

Economic growth does not necessarily
reduce gender gaps in earnings or
enhance women’s economic autonomy
As the 2005 UNRISD report, Gender Equality, argued,6 the
positive outcomes of the past decade – in terms of girls’
enrolment in primary and secondary education, women’s
representation in politics, and new legislation prohibiting
violence and discrimination – must be qualiﬁed in the light
of continuing gender inequalities and a less than favourable
economic environment. The ambiguous nature of women’s
achievements is illustrated most strikingly in what has been
termed the feminization of labour. Not only has women’s
access to paid work increased in most countries (with the
exception of Eastern Europe and Central Asia), but at the
same time, a deterioration has occurred in the terms and
conditions of much of that work. The growth of informal
work across the world (see chapter 1) has allowed employers to lower labour costs and sidestep social protection obligations and labour laws. For many workers, both female
and male, the outcome has been increasing precariousness
of jobs, and greater insecurity in their livelihoods.
Informal employment tends to be a greater source of employment for women than for men in most developing regions,7
with women often concentrated in the most casual and
exploitative segments of informal work. In some contexts,
earnings are so low that even the existence of multiple

107

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

earners is not sufﬁcient to pull the household above the
poverty line. Even though women tend to have far lower
earnings than men, they are not always counted among the
poor because poverty status is measured at the household
level based on pooled income. However, even when women
are able to escape material poverty by pooling income with
other members of the household, especially male partners,
this can leave them in a situation of dependence. This may,
in turn, stiﬂe their voice in domestic relations and close
their exit options.8
The relationship between poverty and gender is complex
because it is placed at the intersection of at least three sets
of institutions: labour markets, which differentially structure and reward male and female labour; households, where
decisions are made about the allocation and distribution
of resources, including labour and earnings, and where
labour itself is (re)produced; and states, which, through
a constantly changing mix of regulatory and provisioning
roles, shape the broader policy environment within which
the other two institutions operate. As the evidence in this
chapter will show, gender inequalities in labour markets are
remarkably persistent and deeply embedded across diverse
development paths.

Gender inequalities in labour
markets are remarkably persistent
and deeply embedded across diverse
development paths
While households and families can play a crucial role in
pooling resources, and sustaining and protecting their
members, they also face major limitations. First, where the
development trajectory is exclusionary and polarizing and
where public provisioning is insufﬁcient, kinship solidarity
networks become exhausted. Second, unequal power relations within households mean that household resources
are unequally distributed to meet individual needs and the
costs of non-market work carried out in sustaining household members are unequally borne. In a monetized world,

108

those who primarily do such work are placed at a disadvantage. The fact that this work is almost exclusively performed by women has repercussions for their access to paid
work: it tends to penalize women and weaken their position
in terms of earnings and occupational status.9 Policy priorities therefore include the need not only for more and better
work opportunities for women – the focus of this chapter
– but also the provision of social services and infrastructure
to ease the domestic and care burden, a fairer distribution
of such work within the household, and the recognition
of such work in social protection systems (as elaborated
in chapter 7).
In essence, the chapter tells the story of women working
harder, but under poorer conditions and with lower wages
and fewer opportunities for advancement than men. The
main conclusions are as follows.
• Economic growth does not necessarily reduce gender
gaps in earnings or enhance women’s economic
autonomy. In fact, even in the world’s richest countries,
women’s wages and the terms of their employment have
failed to keep up with men’s.
• In many developing countries, economic liberalization
has fuelled a rise in informal employment, which has
affected women disproportionately. Moreover, women’s
earning potential is often constrained by social norms
and power imbalances with men.
• While sustained improvements in both the quantity
and quality of paid work are important for enhancing
women’s economic security, they are not sufﬁcient.
Investment in social services, infrastructure and
social protection that can help reduce the unpaid
care work that is assumed by women is also critical,
as are the social and legal changes that can enhance
women’s options.
Section 1 of the chapter explores how labour markets,
states and households affect women’s income in advanced
industrialized countries.
Section 2 examines how gender inequalities are embedded or reproduced in labour markets. It draws its evidence
from a range of developing countries clustered into three

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 4 – GENDER INEQUALITIES AT HOME AND IN THE MARKET

groupings: the late industrializers of East Asia; a wider
range of countries with stalled industrialization;10 and
agrarian economies.
Section 3 looks at how household structures shape women’s
risk of being poor.
Section 4 turns to public policies and considers a range
of interventions that address income poverty and gender
inequality. Here the report underscores the importance of
labour regulation and protection, which have been marginalized in the social policy agenda.

1. Women’s Work and
Income in Advanced
Industrialized Economies
This section analyses how three institutions – labour markets, states and households – shape women’s economic outcomes across a range of high-income countries that have
largely followed the classic path of economic development
(gradually moving from agriculture to manufacturing,
then to services). Countries are grouped into ﬁve clusters
(Anglophone, Continental, Eastern, Northern and Southern European) based on shared principles of social welfare entitlement and relatively homogeneous outcomes.11
The evidence on high-income countries is useful for underlining the diversity of gender patterns of employment
and the role of social policies in narrowing the gender gap
in poverty.

Women’s participation in the labour market
is growing, but gender gaps in wages and
work conditions persist
In most advanced industrialized countries, the gap between
male and female labour force participation has narrowed
signiﬁcantly. However, while men’s rates of participation
are high everywhere, the variations in women’s labour

market participation across regions are signiﬁcant. Nordic
and Anglophone countries show the highest participation rates by women, followed by Continental European
countries. In Southern Europe, gender gaps of more than
20 percentage points are not uncommon. In Eastern European economies that have undergone economic liberalization, on the other hand, labour market participation has
declined and unemployment has skyrocketed for both men
and women. This has reduced and sometimes even reversed
previously common features of these economies, such as
the high presence of women in the labour market.
Signiﬁcant gender inequalities remain beyond simple
economic participation rates. For example, women are
overrepresented in part-time employment vis-à-vis men
in all countries studied. This shows continuity in the
gender division of labour, with men still specializing in fulltime paid employment and women doing the bulk of unpaid
care work and adapting their labour market behaviour to
the possibility of combining both.12 Furthermore, signiﬁcant gender wage gaps persist – caused by occupational
segregation and associated wage penalties for “women’s
jobs” as well as discrimination.13 Across member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), median wages for men are higher
than those for women, even among full-time employees. In
2004, the average difference was 15 per cent; it exceeded
30 per cent in Japan and the Republic of Korea, and
20 per cent in Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the
United States.14

State transfers help narrow the poverty
gap between men and women
A large body of research has established that, in many
developed economies, women are more likely to be poor
than their male counterparts.15 Though the causes underlying women’s higher risk of economic insecurity are complex and overlapping, weaker attachment to the labour
market, in part attributed to the inaccessibility of public
and/or private care services, largely accounts for women’s
lower income and higher relative poverty rates.

109

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

However, this is not the whole story. Signiﬁcant differences across countries emerge in the extent to which social
transfers (such as pensions and unemployment beneﬁts)
mitigate labour market outcomes across social classes. The
poverty-reducing effect of such transfers is much stronger
in the social democratic Northern European cluster than
in the Anglophone and Southern European regime types
(see also table 5.1 in chapter 5). State transfers also narrow
the gender gap in poverty almost everywhere, but women
are still slightly more likely to be poor than men in most
countries. The Northern and some Eastern European countries whose transfer systems seem most progressive (both in
terms of social class and gender) represent the exception to
this rule.16
Because poverty is measured at the household level, there
is little known about the distribution of income and
women’s access to personal income within households.
The pooling of income from various household members
is an important means to reducing gender gaps in market
income. However, in such situations, women remain to
a large extent dependent economically on their partners
and families.
Again, patterns of dependence are substantially shaped by
the dominant policy regime. Northern and Southern European countries represent two opposite scenarios, with women’s reliance on a male breadwinner being low in the ﬁrst
group and extremely high in the second. Indeed, income
pooling within the household does not seem to play a major
role in providing poor women with income in the Nordic
countries, where that role is largely assumed by the state’s
tax-and-transfer system.

State transfers narrow the
gender gap in poverty, but women
are still slightly more likely to
be poor than men

110

Pooling income within households can ease
women’s poverty but create dependency
Single mothers who cannot count on the mitigating effect
of a partner’s market income remain economically vulnerable in many countries. In most countries for which poverty
rates among single parents can be compared, single mothers are more likely to be poor than single fathers, and sometimes dramatically so. As ﬁgure 4.1 shows, Nordic countries
are high performers in reducing the poverty of single mothers. Here, the combination of high levels of employment
for single mothers and strong public services and transfers
keeps poverty rates low. In contrast, Anglophone countries
stand out with very high poverty rates. The experience of
the United States suggests that this is due to the concentration of single mothers in poorly paid employment and the
low level of public transfers.17 Southern European countries
also show relatively high rates, reﬂecting low state support
for lone mothers.

The dynamics of employment and poverty in advanced
industrialized countries show that structural transformation of the economy can have very different implications
for gender equality, depending on the interplay between
labour markets, states and households. The following sections will explore the implications of these issues for a range
of developing and transitional countries.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 4 – GENDER INEQUALITIES AT HOME AND IN THE MARKET

2. Poverty, Work and Gender
in a Development Context
Given this report’s concern with poverty, and the economic and social policies that are effective routes out
of it, this chapter examines how gender as a social
structure affects people’s access to income when mediated through a number of key institutions, including
labour markets.
Employment is usually deﬁned as work in activities that
produce goods and services that are valued and included
in a system of national accounts – that is, those economic
activities that are ofﬁcially counted as part of an economy’s gross domestic product (GDP). These market-based
exchanges can take many different forms and are not conﬁned to situations where individuals exchange their labour
directly for a salary or a wage. Those who are self-employed
– whether farming their own land, working in a family-run
enterprise, or working as street vendors and waste-collectors – engage in other forms of market transaction to realize the value of their labour. The deﬁnition of employment
and labour markets used in this report embraces all these
forms of exchange, even though in practice they are not all
consistently captured and counted in labour force surveys
and calculations of GDP.
Access to employment in itself is not a guaranteed path
out of income poverty, as the term working poor suggests.
A large proportion of employed individuals worldwide do
not earn enough to lift themselves and their dependants
above the poverty threshold.18 The quality of employment matters, not simply the quantity of opportunities.
As chapter 1 has shown, the quality gap between formal, regular employment and informal (or non-standard)
employment represents one of the principal cleavages in
the overall structure of employment today, particularly
in developing countries but increasingly in high-income
industrialized countries as well. The concept of informal
employment captures employment relations that are not
governed by formal economic regulations and/or basic legal
and social protections.19

Women are disproportionately affected
by the rise in informal employment
Research ﬁndings suggest that informal employment has
been expanding as economies have undergone liberalization, both domestic and external, especially in the context of economic crises to which liberalized economies are
prone. Moreover, though it is often assumed that informal
work is linked to low rates of economic growth, the relationship between the two is more complicated. While there
is an inverse relationship between the informalization of
labour and economic growth (conﬁrming the countercyclical nature of informal work), informal employment has
been growing not only in contexts of low economic growth
but also where rates of growth have been modest. The latter
suggests that informal forms of paid work are not just lingering vestiges of backwardness or a by-product of economic
stagnation. In fact, in some contexts, the very growth of
global production networks made possible by the expansion
of foreign direct investment (FDI) has generated informal
production processes. Multinational ﬁrms have sought out
“low-cost and ‘ﬂexible’ labour relations in their productionlevel operations”,20 where women tend to predominate.

Women are often overrepresented
in the most casual and low-earning
segments of the informal economy
Hence, the term informal employment captures very different
kinds of work, some more akin to survival strategies with low
returns that people resort to when economies stagnate. Other
kinds of work (piece-rate, wage work) are integrated into and
contribute to processes of accumulation on a national or global
scale (as is the case with industrial outworkers, for example).
Research has shown that workers in informal employment
earn less, have more volatile incomes, lack access to basic public services and protections, and face higher risks of poverty
compared to workers in formal employment.21 As described
below, women are often overrepresented in the most casual
and low-earning segments of the informal economy. In the
absence of global datasets, special research was commissioned

111

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

for this report to develop the statistical base for selected countries, drawing on the most recently available survey data.22

The informal economy is stratiﬁed by
gender and other social identities
Women and men, as noted for the advanced industrialized countries, tend to be grouped into different occupations (often referred to as horizontal segregation). Women
are also more likely than men to be in occupations with
lower pay, poorer working conditions and limited prospects for advancement (vertical segregation). Despite some
improvements in the 1990s, levels of gender segregation
in the labour market remain high throughout the world.23
Hence, in the absence of effective state regulation, labour
markets themselves tend to reproduce gender inequalities.
Similar segmentation occurs in the informal economy.
Figure 4.2 illustrates the gender characteristics of the informal economy: men tend to be overrepresented in the top
segment of the informal economy (among informal employers); women tend to be overrepresented in the bottom segment (among industrial outworkers); and the relative share
of women and men in the intermediate segments tends to
vary across sectors and countries.24 Comparable stratiﬁcations based on caste, ethnicity and religion, not represented
in ﬁgure 4.2, also mark the informal economy.25

Contrary to conventional wisdom,
economic downturns affect the
informal economy in similar ways
as they do the formal economy
Workers in the informal economy have been particularly
hard hit by the global economic crisis. Contrary to the
conventional wisdom that the informal economy serves
as a cushion for formal workers who lose their jobs, economic downturns affect the informal economy in similar
ways as they do the formal economy. Unlike formal sector
workers, however, informal workers have no cushion to fall
back on.26 In India, for example, informal wage workers in
diamond polishing have already faced massive lay-offs, and
employment contracts have become even more precarious.
Similarly, women construction workers have suffered from
a decline in working days and earnings. Other workers,
such as self-employed waste-collectors, are ﬁnding it more
difﬁcult to survive as demand drops and prices fall.27
As previous chapters have shown, growth paths differ in
their ability to generate employment of sufﬁcient quantity
and quality. This, in turn, shapes women’s (as well as men’s)
prospects of ﬁnding work that provides good terms and
conditions. Yet women generally occupy a more precarious
position in the labour force than men. Four factors conspire
to push women into an unfavourable economic position in
terms of their access to income from gainful employment.
• the gender gap in labour force participation
(female participation rates are increasing, but are
still consistently lower than those of men);
• employment segmentation (women are disproportionately
employed in lower quality employment, including
informal employment, with low returns to labour);
• the gender earnings gap (in general, women earn less
for a given amount and type of work than do men, even
within the same broad category of employment); and
• fewer hours of work (due to the competing demands of
unpaid care work and non-market production).
All of these factors lower the total income earned by women.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 4 – GENDER INEQUALITIES AT HOME AND IN THE MARKET

Social norms and power relations affect women’s
access to paid work and control over earnings
Social norms and practices associated with kinship and family institutions place further constraints on women’s ability
to turn their labour power into a decent wage, and to retain
control over that wage. For example, women’s rates of economic activity have been historically low in the Middle
East and North Africa region (MENA), as well as in parts of
South Asia, and continue to be relatively low, despite some
changes.28 The cultural acceptability of paid work, especially
when it takes place outside the home, the motivations (or
pressures) that lead women to take on work, the kind of work
they do, the varying effects of their life course, and the status
of their households have all been shown to be important factors in shaping women’s experience of paid work.29 Evaluations of young unmarried women entering the paid workforce
have tended, by and large, to be positive. However, the picture
that emerges from micro-level research is more ambiguous
and contradictory with respect to married women, who tend
to report resistance from their husbands to their attempts to
secure paid work. Sometimes this resistance is linked to fears
about public disapproval, anxiety about their wives’ sexual
ﬁdelity, concerns about neglect of domestic duties and their
children’s well-being, and the conviction that access to an
independent income would destabilize male authority.30
Women’s responsibility for providing unpaid care work
often limits the kind of paid work that can be undertaken
to jobs with lower pay and more ﬂexible hours – factors that
very often translate into lower earnings and weaker claims
to social protection. However, ethnographic research suggests that married women often make additional concessions in their private lives in return for permission to take
up paid work. Sometimes this entails handing over their
wages to their husbands to keep the male breadwinner role
intact. At other times it may mean redeﬁning motherhood
to include the purchase of basic essentials or education for
their children. It may also mean that men reduce their own
contribution to the household budget, while women cover
the deﬁcit from their wages. Very often it involves women
putting in long hours of unpaid work to ensure the fulﬁlment of their domestic responsibilities.31

The remainder of this section explores how different
paths of structural change, along with other forces, have
shaped labour markets in three clusters of countries or
areas. Emphasis is placed on the gender inequalities that
have been generated in terms of employment availability,
informality, unemployment and earnings.

Gender inequality in labour markets is
persistent across diverse development paths
Late industrializers in East Asia: Fuelling growth
through women’s low wages
Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China. A muchnoted feature of the development strategies of these late
industrializers was their ability to avoid the type of vertical
inequalities that marked the early history of industrialization
of pioneer countries, such as the United Kingdom. Yet as this
section shows, the low levels of class inequality in the East
Asian late industrializers went hand in hand with signiﬁcant
gender inequalities in the labour market during the heyday
of their development, which continue into the current era.

Low levels of class inequality in
East Asia have gone hand in hand
with signiﬁcant gender inequalities
in the labour market
Despite important differences in their market structures –
large businesses in the Republic of Korea versus small- and
medium-sized enterprises in Taiwan Province of China – a
key component of their strategy of catching up was to target investment in strategic sectors to help industries acquire
the technology they needed to upgrade. It has been argued
that low wages for women, roughly half those of men, were
a stimulus to growth, since women’s low wages kept the
cost of exports down, ﬁnancing the acquisition of technology.32 These low-cost exports were produced primarily
by women, who faced job segregation in export industries
(see box 4.1 for other examples).33 Young, unmarried

113

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

women played a key role in the early, labour-intensive phase
of industrialization between the early 1960s and 1973, with
state policy deliberately mobilizing such labour.34 The
reliance on cheap female labour also bred social conﬂict
and labour militancy. During the 1970s and early 1980s,
women workers in the Republic of Korea actively sought
to improve the terms and conditions of their work through
sit-ins and demonstrations, despite the fact that strikes and
other forms of social mobilization were illegal and often
met with police violence.
High rates of economic growth and structural transformation guaranteed near-full employment, rising wage rates
and some forms of corporate welfare (in the case of the
Republic of Korea) for a signiﬁcant share of the male workforce. Women workers, in contrast, remained in a relatively
disadvantaged position throughout this period. To be sure,
the number of economically active women grew continuously in the 1960s and 1970s, and women’s share of total
employment also increased. The sectoral composition of
the female workforce also shifted during that period, from
agriculture to manufacturing. From the 1980s onwards,
post-industrial strategies in Taiwan Province of China and
the Republic of Korea turned from the manufacturing of
labour-intensive exports and diversiﬁed into capital- and
skill-intensive products35 in an attempt to “upgrade their
economies technologically”.36
When industries upgrade technologically, it is the female
workforce that is often displaced. So while export-led regimes
of the 1960s resulted in the feminization of manufacturing
labour in Taiwan Province of China, the simultaneous opening up to FDI and domestic capital mobility from the 1980s
onwards has reversed into a “de-feminization of labour”.37
The displacement of female manufacturing employees was
not matched with a signiﬁcant absorption of female workers into other sectors.38 A similar process of de-feminization
has been documented in the Republic of Korea, where the
demand for women’s labour in manufacturing weakened by
the early 1990s, and where the composition of the workforce
in the electronics industry changed in favour of male workers as production in this sector shifted to more sophisticated
communication and computer products.39

114

How do women and men fare in terms of job security in
these two Asian Tigers? After three decades of industrial
development and high growth, only about 37.6 per cent
of female workers in the Republic of Korea had regular
full-time jobs in 1990 (compared to 64.5 per cent of male
workers), while 62.4 per cent had temporary or daily work
(compared to 35.5 per cent of male workers).40 The bulk
of employed women therefore faced considerable insecurity and instability in terms of employment and income.
The general sectoral shift in Korean employment from
manufacturing to services has been accompanied by greater
labour market ﬂexibility, which has resulted in increased
use of non-regular or non-standard (temporary and daily)
workers by companies, especially following the East Asian
crisis of 1997.41 Based on a revised method of data collection, non-standard employment was estimated to account
for 24.1 per cent of men’s employment and 40.3 per cent of
women’s employment in 2005.42 Weekly hours of work are
signiﬁcantly lower in non-standard employment, compared
to regular wage employment and to various forms of selfemployment. Average hourly earnings are also signiﬁcantly
lower than those of regular paid employees. These factors
place serious limitations on women’s earning potential.
Moreover, rapid growth in wages does not eliminate gender
gaps in wages. Despite rising pay scales in the Republic of
Korea’s manufacturing sector from 1980 to 1992, the gender wage gap was far from closed. The average all-industry
(excluding agriculture) ratio of women’s to men’s wages
was 42.9 per cent in 1980, rising to 53.4 per cent in 1990,
indicating that women were earning only about half as
much as men. Data for 2002 indicate that this ratio rose to
66 per cent for the Republic of Korea and 70 per cent for
Taiwan Province of China. Contrary to neoclassical expectations, increasing exposure to import competition and
rising trade shares over the period 1980–1999 in both places
did not help reduce discrimination against women, nor did
it increase employment opportunities for cheaper women
workers.43 Taiwanese employers transferred production to
mainland China and Southeast Asia, where they could
employ cheaper labour, while local male labour was retained
in the newer technology-intensive industries. Earnings discrimination increased as women’s employment declined.44

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 4 – GENDER INEQUALITIES AT HOME AND IN THE MARKET

BOX 4.1: Export-oriented manufacturing: Facilitating women’s access to social rights?
In the context of trade liberalization, women have constituted an important share of the workforce employed in export-oriented
manufacturing industries in a wide range of developing countries. However, this development has often differed from the production
for export in the late industrializing economies of East Asia, where export manufacturing was actively promoted while also protecting
domestic markets. Not only has foreign direct investment (FDI) played a more central role in many of these developing countries, but
the industries have also been criticized for their enclave nature, given their weak linkages to the national economy.
There has been a curious absence of systematic analysis of social policies in the extensive literature exploring different facets of
women’s employment in these export-oriented industries. Economists have tended to focus on wages and gender-based wage gaps in
the context of export-orientation. The more sociological strands in the literature explore the processes of gender subordination and
women’s agency in households, communities and factories where they live and work. The corporate social responsibility and activist
literature by trade unions, NGOs and women’s organizations concerned with working conditions comes closest to asking questions
that relate to social policy. But little attempt has been made to link these ﬁndings to broader social policy trajectories.
A six-country study by UNRISD showed that women workers in export-oriented economies are for the most part disadvantaged in
terms of social rights accessed via the employment contract. Hence formal employment does not seem to constitute a route for
women to access social protection measures and a social wage. The countries included China, India, the Republic of Korea, Mauritius,
Mexico and South Africa. In China and Mexico, in particular, export manufacturing has constituted an important engine of growth.
In China the rise of the private and foreign sector has led to a rapid growth of demand for women workers both in the export-oriented
factories of the special economic zones (SEZs) in the coastal provinces of the eastern seaboard, as well as in the Town and Village
Enterprises. This reﬂects the signiﬁcant transformation in the structure of the labour market since China reoriented its economy to
global markets. In the SEZs, there is a multifaceted labour hierarchy: most technical and managerial posts are held by foreigners
and sometimes by middle-class Chinese men, while the semi-skilled workers are predominantly female. Most of the permanent
workers are local inhabitants. But the majority of the workforce is recruited from rural areas, many of them released from agriculture
as a result of decollectivization in the late 1970s. Estimates based on numerous surveys show female workforces comprise around
80 per cent. They have temporary status in their place of work and no access to social protection mechanisms or welfare beneﬁts.
They return home periodically, during spells of unemployment, when ill, or to give birth.
In Mexico most employment creation within manufacturing over the past 10–15 years has been concentrated in the maquiladora sector,
a large part of it located in the northern states near the Mexican–US border. The fact that women make up about half of this workforce
would seem to suggest that they are in a position to reap beneﬁts from being contributors to the principal engine of national economic
growth. Has this been the case? On the more positive side, there is some evidence to suggest that women workers in maquiladora
cities, particularly in the north, have some access to social protection measures and greater employment stability than those in
non-maquiladora cities in the interior. Female maquiladora workers, for example, have access to some basic legally mandatory
beneﬁts such as social security and paid leave. Yet they have little or no access to gender-speciﬁc non-wage beneﬁts such as childcare
provision or maternity leave – both essential for women workers and mandatory entitlements for formally employed women.
Women’s relative advantages have also been more than offset by the shifting location of low technology assembly plants – which
offer lower pay and poorer access to protection and regulation – to the interior provinces where women outnumber men. Between
1975 and 1999 women’s share of the blue-collar workforce went down from 67.3 to 45 per cent. It is widely believed that part of the
reason for this decline has been due to the recruitment of men (rather than women) into the more technologically advanced industries
and occupations.
Export success is clearly useful but not sufﬁcient for promoting rapid growth of employment combined with rising real wages and
meaningful access to social welfare. Moreover, where women have been conﬁned to sectors that seek low-cost labour, as in apparel
and textile production, there seems to be less scope for wage bargaining and welfare provisioning, as companies can threaten to exit
to lower cost countries (see also chapter 9).

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

As supply chains are faced with falling
global demand, women in export
sectors are often the ﬁrst to be laid off

Brazil and South Africa. Brazil and South Africa provide a case in point. In both countries, agriculture plays
a relatively small role in terms of employment and household income, even though it is a more important source
of employment for men than for women (see table 4.1).
The feminization of agriculture45 observed in other middle-income Latin American countries does not seem to be
occurring in these two countries. Women’s and, to a lesser
extent, men’s employment is thus concentrated in nonagricultural sectors.

Stalled industrialization in dualist economies:
Persistent gender and ethnic inequalities
In a number of middle-income countries, including
Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, structural
change was well under way in the 1970s and 1980s. In
contrast to the East Asian experience, skewed income
distribution in favour of high-income groups encouraged
skill- and capital-intensive forms of industrialization that
limited the incorporation of marginalized groups into the
development process. Today, access to employment in
many of these countries is still characterized by sharp
vertical and horizontal inequalities, including those based
on gender and ethnicity.

The combination of lower labour force participation
rates, employment segmentation, fewer hours of work and
signiﬁcant gender gaps in earnings lowers women’s income
from employment in both countries and puts them at a
disadvantage in relation to men. However, two important differences arise between the South African and
Brazilian cases, and both are heavily inﬂuenced by gender
and ethnicity.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 4 – GENDER INEQUALITIES AT HOME AND IN THE MARKET

First, the relative weight of informal employment is far more
important in Brazil than it is in South Africa. Although
Brazil has experienced growth in formal employment since
the early 2000s, informal employment still accounted for
around two-thirds of male and female employment in 2005
(see table 4.1). The relatively smaller size of the informal
economy in South Africa has been attributed to apartheid
policies, which placed restrictions on the economic engagement of Africans prior to 1994.
In both countries, women are particularly concentrated
in informal wage work, reﬂecting the large numbers of
domestic workers – a phenomenon closely tied to ethnic
and income inequalities. In 2006, domestic service employment in Brazil accounted for 18.3 per cent of women’s and
0.4 per cent of men’s employment.46 More than half of
female domestic workers are of African descent.47 In South
Africa, domestic service employment accounted for 16 per
cent of female and 2 per cent of male employment in 2007;
again, the large majority of domestic workers (91 per cent)
are from ethnically disadvantaged groups.48
Second, while informal labour relations are less extensive,
unemployment is much higher in South Africa than in
Brazil (see table 4.1). In both countries, however, women
are more affected than men. In Brazil, women are almost
twice as likely as men to be unemployed, mirroring the
situation of other Latin American countries, including
Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica and Uruguay, where women
are also overrepresented among the unemployed.49 It is
important to bear in mind that women’s unemployment
(as a general rule) is likely to be undercounted relative to
men’s, since it is more acceptable for a woman to declare
that she is a homemaker (and thus outside the labour force)
rather than looking for work (and thus technically unemployed), even though she may, in fact, be an unsuccessful
work-seeker.
Within most categories of employment, women earn less
than men. Hourly earnings are particularly low in informal employment. In Brazil, for example, domestic workers
earn less than 50 per cent of average hourly earnings of
all employed individuals. In South Africa, this share drops

to 30 per cent. Even when compared to female workers in
other informal, non-agricultural occupations, differences
are still substantial.
Differences in the hours worked by employed women and
employed men are likely to further exacerbate women’s
lower access to income from gainful employment. In both
countries, women’s weekly hours of paid, market work are
80–90 per cent those of men. One of the principal explanations for the gender difference in the work week is that, on
average, women are engaged in much more non-market,
unpaid work in their households and their communities
than are men (see chapter 7).
Ethnicity is a potentially important determinant of social
and economic well-being in both South Africa and Brazil. This is not to ignore equally important divisions within
other countries analysed in this chapter, such as those created by the caste system in India, for example, or experienced by immigrant and ethnic minorities in the Republic
of Korea or distinct ethnic/linguistic groups in Kenya.
However, Brazil and South Africa are useful case studies
in terms of the impact of ethnicity, which clearly acts as
a stratiﬁer on the labour market and often intersects with
gender, as in the case of domestic workers.
In South Africa, ethnic disadvantages in the labour market
are the combined result of economic exclusion (high unemployment rates) and unfavourable inclusion (concentration
in low-quality employment) – particularly for the African
population (see table 4.2). There is also a signiﬁcant ethnic
earnings gap within each category of employment: earnings are lowest for Africans, somewhat higher for mixed
ethnicity (known as Coloured in the administrative ethnic
categorization of the apartheid era), higher still for Indians,
and the highest overall for the white population.

In Brazil and South Africa,
ethnicity clearly acts as a stratiﬁer
on the labour market and often
intersects with gender

In Brazil, labour force participation and unemployment
rates are rather similar across ethnic groups, and labour market disadvantages appear to manifest themselves more in
terms of unfavourable inclusion. This means that informal
employment accounts for a much larger share of employment among Afro-descendants50 and indigenous populations as compared to whites and Asians (see table 4.2). In
terms of average hourly earnings, Afro-descendants and
indigenous workers systematically receive the lowest returns
on their labour. Asian workers receive the highest average
returns on their labour, followed by the white population.

Agrarian economies: Insecure livelihoods for both
women and men
Over the past two decades, rural livelihoods have become
less secure. States have cut back their support to domestic
agriculture. At the same time, exposure to competition from
large subsidized producers has increased and global commodity markets have become more volatile. Many observers note
that a striking feature of agrarian change in contemporary
developing country societies is the growing prevalence of

118

livelihood diversiﬁcation (deﬁned as “the process by which
rural families construct a diverse portfolio of activities and
social support capabilities in their struggle for survival and
in order to improve their standard of living”51). For vast
sections of the population, both female and male, this has
meant a constant search for income through wage work and
self-employment that is often thinly disguised wage work, in
or away from the village. In developing countries with extensive informal economies, off-farm activities are for the most
part informal, even if a small fraction of workers obtain jobs
in the formal economy (as public sector employees, usually
frontline service providers in rural clinics and schools).
India and Kenya. Although GDP growth rates in India
accelerated sharply in the 1980s and 1990s, driven mainly
by the service sector, employment is still dominated by agriculture (engaging 74 per cent of the country’s workforce).
In Kenya, both the productive and employment structures
are dominated by the primary sector (63 per cent), and it
is also this sector that provides the high-value-added horticultural exports that are critical to Kenya’s trade balance.

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 4 – GENDER INEQUALITIES AT HOME AND IN THE MARKET

While labour force participation rates among Kenyan women
and men are relatively high and fairly similar, India exhibits a
large gender gap (see table 4.1) – patterns that are fairly typical
of the two respective regions. In general, employment is largely
informal in both countries, far more than in dualist economies
discussed in the previous section, and women are less likely
than men to have access to scarce formal employment.
In both countries, agricultural employment accounts for
a larger share of women’s employment than men’s – the
reverse situation of Brazil and South Africa – and virtually
all of this employment is informal (see table 4.1). In fact,
women constitute the backbone of the agricultural sector
as smallholders and casual wage earners in both countries.
The share of women working as contributing family members in informal agricultural activities is particularly high.
In Kenya, agricultural production has been increasing in
recent years and is now the leading source of growth. The
rapid expansion of horticultural production initially spurred
growth in production of smallholder farms as well as an
increase in the number of workers on large commercial
operations.52 Women in Kenya work as smallholders (either
managing their own farms or working on the family farm)
and as seasonal agricultural wage workers in high-value
export production (particularly ﬂowers) organized by larger
commercial enterprises. However, the absolute numbers
involved do not exceed 100,000.53 Employment in the horticultural sector does appear to reduce poverty and raise living
standards among households when compared to households
that do not participate in the sector. Yet many of the jobs
generated are casual and seasonal, and income is volatile.54
Furthermore, the number of jobs generated by the sector in
the near future is likely to be relatively small compared to
the employment challenge Kenya currently faces.55
In India, women comprise an increasingly important proportion of the casual labour force in rural areas, as men withdraw
from agriculture into other occupations.56 In contrast to Kenya,
agricultural growth rates in India in the 1990s were sluggish
(around 2 per cent per year), especially when compared to
the strong growth record of the economy as a whole. Moreover, public investment in agriculture (in irrigation and ﬂood

control) has been low and declining, putting real limitations
on productivity and employment growth in this sector57 – key
challenges in the long-term quest for poverty reduction.
Services in India, as in many other developing countries,
have expanded to include a broad range of activities –
from domestic work (catering to the growing middle class)
and street hawking to servicing a burgeoning information
technology industry. Most of these occupations entail long
hours of work and minimal or no social protection, and
yield vastly different levels of income, skill, productivity
and career prospects.58 The employment share of services is
low for the level of output it generates (less than 25 per cent
of total employment, contributing 53 per cent of GDP).
The boom of information technology services and the offshoring of ofﬁce work by multinational companies have
opened up career opportunities in formal skill-intensive
employment for educated, English-speaking women from
the urban middle classes. While women make up a large
share of the workforce in this emerging sector, segmentation
and discrimination along the lines of gender, caste and class
are widespread, and women tend to be concentrated in lowend occupations.59 Furthermore, as chapter 1 has shown, the
information technology sector employs less than one million people. Its potential for transforming aggregate employment patterns in the near future is thus rather low, and most
working women in India are still to be found in either informal agricultural work or lower paid service activities of the
more precarious kind (such as domestic work).
Gender gaps in weekly earnings are signiﬁcant due to a combination of lower hourly wages and less time dedicated to paid
work in both countries, but are wider in India than in Kenya.
On average, women’s weekly earnings amount to only half
of those of men in India, and two-thirds of those of men in
Kenya.60 Weekly earnings are lowest in informal agricultural
employment, where most working women are concentrated.
In sum, while there is much variation in the extent, form
and quality of women’s employment across the three clusters of countries analysed in this section as well as between
countries in each cluster, gender hierarchies are nevertheless
pervasive and a powerful force in shaping labour markets.

119

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

3. Gender, Poverty and the Role
of Household Structures
The ﬁndings in previous sections are important to understanding the relationship between employment and poverty outcomes for women. While women’s weaker labour
market attachment reduces their access to personal earnings, this is not always reﬂected in greater female poverty
rates (measured at the household level). Section 1 of this
chapter has shown, for instance, that despite relatively low
labour market earnings in Southern European countries,
women are not signiﬁcantly poorer than men, largely due
to income pooling within the household. Are women’s
labour market disadvantages and lower earnings in other
countries also compensated for in this way? This section
looks at the poverty rates of the working poor, assessing the
likelihood that workers in particular types of employment
will live in income-poor households.

Income pooling is not sufﬁcient to close genderbased poverty gaps in the Republic of Korea
In the Republic of Korea, working poor poverty rates are
equally low for men and women in regular employment.
However, the estimated poverty rates among women working as temporary and daily (that is, non-regular) workers are

much higher than those of men in similar employment situations. This suggests that income pooling within the household is not sufﬁcient to close gender-based poverty gaps.
Women in temporary and daily employment in urban areas
are almost three times as likely to live in poor households as
are men in the same employment categories (see table 4.3).
Gender gaps are slightly smaller in rural areas. This pattern
may be related to the fact that a larger proportion of daily
and temporary female workers are the only earners, or the
primary earners, in their households (46.5 per cent of daily
workers and 39.8 per cent of temporary workers, as opposed
to 35 per cent of regular workers). Given the large gender
gaps in wages, poverty rates for households in which women
are the main or only breadwinners are higher than those of
households in which men are the main or sole earners.

Income pooling effects in Brazil and South
Africa vary according to household structures
In Brazil and South Africa, the poverty risk by employment
category increases as people move from formal to informal
employment (see table 4.4). Informal agricultural workers,
contributing family workers and domestic workers have particularly high rates of poverty relative to other employed
individuals. If poverty rates are disaggregated by gender,
however, the ﬁgures show that employed women, at least in
Brazil, often have a lower average poverty rate than employed
men, particularly in speciﬁc categories of employment.

Why might employed women – who are disadvantaged in
terms of employment opportunities and earnings – have
lower poverty rates than men in similar categories of
employment? This seemingly contradictory result emerges
because aggregate household income, not an individual’s
position in the labour market, determines poverty status.
Thus, employed women may have lower poverty rates on
average than men in similar employment categories because
their contribution to family income makes the difference

as to whether the household is considered poor or not –
even when women’s employment is of very low quality.
In South Africa, the picture is quite different. Here, poverty
rates among employed women are almost always higher than
those among employed men, suggesting that income pooling does not have the same effect as it does in Brazil. One
possible explanation can be found in the combination of
employment patterns with household structure. And in this

121

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

respect, one ﬁnds an important difference between Brazil and South Africa. First, dual-earner households (using
the proxy of employed males and females) are much more
common in Brazil than in South Africa. This means that
a woman’s lower average earnings are at least theoretically
off-set by combining her earnings with that of other household members. Second, households in which women are the
sole or dominant earner are more common in South Africa
than in Brazil – either because men are absent or because
they are unemployed or economically inactive. This increases
women’s risk of poverty since they have no male partner with
whom to pool their income. The South African phenomenon
of “absent men” may be inﬂuenced in part by the country’s

historical growth path characterized by enclave economies
(that is, with few linkages to national economy) and an
extensive male migrant system, which has left an indelible
imprint on household structures and gender relations.61
Interestingly, the fact that income pooling at the household
level sometimes mitigates gender inequalities in earnings
does not hold true in terms of ethnicity, another horizontal
inequality. As described in the previous section, ethnicity
acts as a powerful stratiﬁer in dualist labour markets. Given
ethnic disadvantages, one would expect to ﬁnd them reﬂected
in working poor poverty rates. Tables 4.5 and 4.6 generally
conﬁrm this expectation for South Africa and Brazil.

When working poor poverty rates are analysed by gender,
employed women sometimes have lower measured poverty
rates than employed men, mainly due to income pooling.
This is because women and men tend to live together in
the same household and, in households where women are in
paid employment, the overall risk of poverty will be lower.

Although inter-ethnic households certainly exist in Brazil and
South Africa, it is common to ﬁnd that all household members
belong to the same ethnic group and face similar economic
disadvantages. Therefore, working poor poverty rates often
more closely track ethnicity-based labour market disadvantages than gender-based disadvantages in paid employment.

123

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

In India, women’s employment
is often induced by distress, in contrast
to Kenya
In India and Kenya, the differences between women
and men in terms of average earnings are also not
necessarily reﬂected in a comparison of their poverty
rates (see table 4.4). In India (as in South Africa), poverty
rates among employed women are almost always higher
than those among employed men. However, in Kenya
(as in Brazil), the same generalization cannot be made,
especially in formal employment and in informal nonagricultural wage labour. How can this difference
be explained?
A number of factors seem to be at work here. First, female
employment in India appears to have more of a distress
character, especially in urban areas. In Indian cities,
income-poor households exhibit a higher female employment rate (19.3 per cent) than the average employment
rate for all urban women (16.6 per cent). Poverty can
therefore be seen as a factor that pushes women into the
paid workforce, and often into marginal forms of employment with very low pay. This does not hold true for men:
in poor urban households, the male employment rate
is actually lower than the average rate for all urban men
(49.8 per cent and 54.9 per cent, respectively).
In Kenya, there is less evidence of women’s employment
having a strong distress character. Female participation
in the workforce seems to be generally high and evenly
spread across income strata. The labour force participation
rate among poor women is actually somewhat lower than
among non-poor women (63 per cent versus 69 per cent).
If this pattern is combined with the signiﬁcantly higher
female labour force participation rates overall, this suggests
that distress employment may account for a smaller share of
women’s total employment in Kenya as compared to India.
Although a lot of factors are at work here, it also suggests
that, in Kenya, women’s employment may lower the risk of
poverty (due to the income they earn), instead of poverty
pushing women into very marginal forms of employment
(which appears to be the case in India).

124

Two conclusions emerge from the analysis in this section.
First, the poverty risk that different categories of workers
face is determined by both labour market institutions and
the structure of the household in which they live.
Second, even if by pooling income with other household
members (usually partners or husbands) women can compensate for their own very low earnings and escape poverty,
this reinforces their ﬁnancial dependence on others who
decide how resources are allocated, while restricting their
exit options.

4. The Role of the State in
Addressing Gender Inequality
and Poverty: Implications
for Policy
Development strategies can have a direct effect on the
extent and severity of poverty by creating jobs and incomes.
Conversely, generalized policies of macroeconomic contraction that operate through demand deﬂation are likely to
have a negative effect on the conditions of poorer groups,
as has been seen in many developing economies.
As this chapter has shown, gender inequalities are not
necessarily reduced, and may even be reinforced, during
the process of structural change. The East Asian scenarios clearly showed that success in employment generation
does not necessarily reduce gender inequalities. Job creation can easily bypass women or, in the absence of labour
market policies that counter gender discrimination, can
include them on unfavourable terms. Yet neoliberal policy
prescriptions have argued that deregulation, ﬂexibility and
the removal of market distortions can generate better and
more work, a rise in real wages and a reduction in gender
gaps. In practice, this has not happened. In many developing countries, as described in this report, the larger part of
the economy operates beyond the regulatory reach of the
state, and this has had a particularly detrimental impact on
marginalized groups.62 Not only have governments curbed

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 4 – GENDER INEQUALITIES AT HOME AND IN THE MARKET

recruitment into the public sector. They sometimes also
violate their own regulatory framework through the segmentation of their employees into permanent, contract and
voluntary workers, and it is among the latter that women
predominate. The desirability of, and urgent need for, a set
of clear public policy choices that create, expand and give
“teeth” to the legal rights of workers – regardless of gender
and caste/ethnicity, both at work and with respect to social
protection – cannot be denied.63

There is an urgent need for a set
of clear policy choices that create,
expand and give “teeth” to the legal
rights of workers
Feminist mobilization at multiple levels has succeeded
in articulating previously unheard views, has confronted
established conventions, exposed previously unchallenged
biases and, to some extent, rewritten political agendas.
One area of remarkable policy convergence has been
female education, valued for both intrinsic and instrumental reasons. The elimination of gender disparity in primary
and secondary education is one of the targets of the third
Millennium Development Goal (MDG). Girls’ enrolment
in primary education has increased rapidly the world over,
sharply reducing or closing and, in some cases, reversing
the gender gap in school attendance; the secondary enrolment rate for girls has also grown, surpassing that of boys in
three regions.64
However, the distribution of jobs by gender can be only
partially explained by different educational endowments.
Women tend to be crowded into lower paying jobs, and
the bulk of gender wage differentials are explained by factors other than human capital differences.65 Labour market discrimination often means that women are in practice
required to have higher levels of education than men to
compete in the workforce on equal terms. Although highly
educated women have advanced their careers despite the
discriminatory forces that remain stubbornly in place,

most women are still trapped in informal and low-return
economic activities.
Action in three areas is critical for enhancing women’s
economic security:
• formalization of informal jobs through stronger
employment regulation;
• improvement of protection mechanisms for people
who have no access to formal employment; and
• increased access to other productive assets that
facilitate income generation in the absence of formal
employment opportunities.

Protect informal workers through
state regulation
There is no single solution for the problem of labour informality, given the heterogeneity of informal work. The
common policy prescription of formalizing the informal
economy thus needs to be comprehensive in design but tailored to different forms of informality. To date, the formalization debate has focused primarily on the self-employed
in informal enterprises and often, more speciﬁcally, on
micro-entrepreneurs who hire others (hence, the emphasis
on property rights, which is supposed to promote entrepreneurship and economic dynamism66). At a minimum, this
debate needs to distinguish between wage workers in informal jobs and the self-employed in informal enterprises.67
As already demonstrated, the main attraction of the informal economy for employers is precisely the absence of
labour regulation, allowing lower labour costs and greater
exploitation of workers. This means that a fundamental
policy issue is the absence of regulation and lack of protection for workers as well as workers’ lack of voice and political inﬂuence.68 Hence the lack of rights at work needs to be
much more forcefully addressed in policy agendas.
The case for greater regulation is particularly strong when
it comes to wage employment. One area of typically female
informal work that is receiving increasing attention from
trade unions, governments and multilateral development
agencies is paid domestic work (see box 4.2).

125

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

BOX 4.2: Reducing the poverty of domestic workers by promoting their rights
While domestic service employment is a signiﬁcant and, in some contexts, growing source of jobs for women and girls in many
developing countries, domestic workers often lack access to labour rights and social protection. In some countries, such as India,
domestic employment is not even recognized as such. The earnings of domestic workers in that country tend to be among the lowest
of all professions, and far from enough to keep their households out of poverty. In Brazil and South Africa, for example, 30 per cent
and 65 per cent of domestic workers, respectively, live in poor households.a

Several countries have attempted to improve the employment conditions and status of domestic workers. In Bolivia, for example,
years of lobbying by domestic workers’ organizations culminated in the formulation of a household worker law in 2003, stipulating
a minimum wage, maximum working hours, holidays and a bonus of one year’s pay after ﬁve years of work. Argentina, Chile,
Peru and South Africa have also recently strengthened the protection of domestic workers. How were rights of domestic workers
placed on the policy agenda in these countries? Comparative research on legal reforms in Latin America suggests that besides
autonomous organizing on the part of domestic workers themselves, political alliances with labour, feminist and indigenous
organizations, as well as progressive legislators, were key.b

Of course, enshrining the rights of domestic workers to decent pay and working conditions is only a ﬁrst – albeit necessary – step to
greater social protection. Legal rights also need to be enforced and complied with. So what has been achieved? Evidence from South
Africa suggests that labour market interventions can help improve wages and working conditions: the introduction of minimum wages
is claimed to have raised hourly earnings by more than 20 per cent within one year, without apparent negative effects on employment.
Other legal requirements, such as the right to a written contract, paid leave, severance pay, dismissal notice and access to unemployment
insurance seem to have had similar positive effects: they raised the proportion of domestic workers with a written contract from
7 per cent in 2002 to 36 per cent in 2007 and the share reporting unemployment deductions from 3 per cent to 32 per cent.c

The quest for domestic workers’ rights is increasingly being pursued at the global level. For example, in March 2008, the governing
body of the International Labour Organization (ILO) agreed to put decent work for domestic workers on the agenda of the 2010
International Labour Conference, with a view to adopting a convention and/or recommendation the following year.
Notes: a Heintz 2008. b Bloﬁeld 2009. c Hertz 2004; Lund and Budlender 2009.

Promote social protection, but not as
a substitute for decent employment
In the context of greater labour market ﬂexibility and
deregulation, increasing emphasis has been placed on
the expansion of social protection to informal workers
or other vulnerable groups. While this is a timely and
welcome development, there is also the danger of delinking social protection from the operation of the labour
market. Narrowly conceived social protection agendas
cannot be a substitute for employment creation and decent
work agendas.

126

In the Republic of Korea, for example, the state’s response
to the deregulation of the labour market has been to
strengthen and extend the reach of key social welfare
programmes, particularly social insurance. Thus, multiple health insurance funds were merged into a single
integrated public scheme, National Health Insurance,
in 2000.69 Similarly, universal coverage for old-age security was achieved by the end of the 1990s through the
National Pension Plan (see chapter 5). Despite the recent
expansion in entitlements to insurance beneﬁts, lack of
compliance by employers, especially of non-regular workers, remains a key obstacle. This affects women more

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 4 – GENDER INEQUALITIES AT HOME AND IN THE MARKET

than men, given their already noted overrepresentation
among temporary and daily workers. In the case of the
National Pension Plan, which has been gradually extended
to all workers, including daily, temporary, self-employed
and family workers, women make up less than a third of the
total. The main reason is to be found in the low pension
enrolment rate among women until recently, and the mandatory minimum 25-year maturity for pension beneﬁts.70
Dualist economies, such as Brazil and South Africa, have
focused on social assistance as a means to combat poverty and economic insecurity. In Brazil, where contributory programmes cover less than half of the economically
active population, cash transfers targeted at the poor have
become central within the social protection system since
the late 1990s. This includes non-means-tested rural pensions and the main conditional cash transfer programme,
Bolsa Familia. South Africa has also gradually expanded
non-contributory social assistance beneﬁts ﬁnanced out of
tax revenues (see table 4.7). Cash grants (such as the Child
Support Grant) are claimed to be highly redistributive and
to have contributed to a reduction in poverty of about 2 per

cent in 2005.71 Similar to other cash transfer programmes,
women predominate among the beneﬁciaries in both Brazil
(93 per cent) and South Africa (85 per cent).72
Although data are scant, it can be assumed that transfers
have a positive effect on the resources poor women have
at their disposal. There is some debate as to whether the
targeting of cash transfers leads to net beneﬁts for women
beneﬁciaries themselves, especially in terms of their access
to employment and economic security.73 However, a regular
and reliable source of income should be viewed positively,
particularly in contexts where large numbers of women
care for children and other dependants on their own.
In some cases, cash transfers may facilitate women’s job
search and access to paid employment.74 However, means
testing has also been shown to be problematic: local ofﬁcials sometimes add new tests of eligibility, such as proving
that taxes have been paid and requiring letters to be certiﬁed by police ofﬁcers.75 Social assistance claimants may be
perceived as dependants on government handouts, thereby
justifying the discretionary handling of these beneﬁts
(see chapter 5).76

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Increase women’s access to land,
microcredit and other productive assets
A third area for policy intervention comprises measures
that support women’s income-earning activities through
access to productive assets, including land and microcredit.
Microcredit schemes, like cash transfer programmes, can
be seen as a response to the failure of economic strategies
to generate sufﬁcient employment that provides decent
wages. It is also often believed that self-employment generated through microcredit will help women reconcile the
competing demands of income earning with their family
responsibilities.77
In India, the banking sector reforms in 1991 led to a
decline in the bank credit given to rural areas,78 and the
government has sought to ﬁll a part of this gap through
a rapid expansion in the provision of microcredit through
the formation of Self-Help Groups, especially of women.
The Self-Help Group–linkage programme has grown from
support to 500 such groups in 1992 to 500,000 in 2002,
covering over 40 million poor people, 90 per cent of
whom are women.79 Such an enormous expansion of
credit oriented to women in groups, rather than household
production units, is potentially beneﬁcial. However, since
these programmes disburse small loans, this could also
result in a two-tier system in which women have excellent
credit access, but only to small amounts that have to be
quickly repaid (and do not allow funds to go into incomebearing activities that have a long gestation period),
while men access bank loans that are large enough for
signiﬁcant investments.80

Access to decent jobs,
vocational training and enabling
social services are necessary to
providing women with a sustainable
route out of poverty and access
to personal income

128

More importantly, though, is the fact that the provision
of credit, while necessary, is far from sufﬁcient for successful self-employment. Rather, it is the general economic
context that plays a determinant role.81 Evidence of the
impact of credit programmes on women’s empowerment at
the household level, in terms of gender relations, are contradictory, with some evidence of more frequent domestic
violence, sometimes linked to pressure to repay debts, and
increased work burdens, as well as greater ﬁnancial autonomy.82 A ﬁnal note of caution raised by village-level studies
in India is that, with the decline in formal sector banking in the countryside, the exploitation of the rural poor
has intensiﬁed as informal sources of credit (moneylenders, merchants, landlords) have rushed in to ﬁll the gap.
Microcredit schemes controlled by NGOs have not managed to achieve the spread and reach of the formal rural
banking system, and can only be a supplement in a much
more diverse system of rural credit.83

Institute policies that support women’s
long-term economic security
Social assistance, social insurance and microcredit cannot
resolve the problem of gender-based poverty and inequality
unless they are underpinned by policies that promote women’s long-term economic security. Access to decent jobs,
vocational training, enabling social services and amenities
are just as necessary to providing women with a sustainable
route out of poverty and access to personal income.
Especially in countries where agriculture remains important
to people’s livelihoods, access to land is a crucial component of economic security. Gender analyses of land tenure
institutions have exposed the complex of laws, customs,
social norms, social relations and practices that conspire
to exclude women from ownership and control of property
in many regions (the situations in South Asia84 and Latin
America85 have been most extensively researched). Some of
this work has been taken up in certain policy and advocacy
circles. The rather simplistic view has been constructed
that rural women’s poverty can be attributed to their lack
of access to land and that land markets are the solution.86

SECTION ONE – CHAPTER 4 – GENDER INEQUALITIES AT HOME AND IN THE MARKET

This raises two key issues. First, given the centrality of land
markets and of market-based agrarian reform in the currently
dominant neoliberal economic agenda, it is important to
ask if market prescriptions are likely to accommodate women’s land claims. Although the empirical base is far from
comprehensive, a judicious reading of the existing evidence
points to the severe limitations of land markets as a channel for women’s inclusion, especially for the vast majority
of women smallholders, landless agricultural labourers and
those doing different kinds of informal work.87

In countries where agriculture remains
important to people’s livelihoods,
access to land is a crucial component
of economic security

Second, a broader agenda is necessary to meet the needs
of women farmers. In many parts of rural sub-Saharan
Africa, for example, women’s farming is often constrained
not because they are prevented from accessing land,
but because they lack capital or regular non-agricultural

marketing channels.88 This calls for a more comprehensive set of policies to support smallholder agriculture
(see chapter 1).
In situations where capital accumulation relies on the incorporation of women into paid work, whether agricultural or
not, and is not matched by a reduction in the amount of
unpaid care work that women and girls undertake to meet
their social obligations, it is very likely to result in the
extension of total work time, with negative implications
for their well-being (see chapter 7).89

TRANSFORMATIVE SOCIAL POLICY
AND POVERTY REDUCTION
Section Two

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

If the 1980s were about separating the economic from the social, then the 1990s and beyond
have signalled a rediscovery of the social. These changes have come in the wake of widespread
realization that the neoliberal model has failed either to generate economic growth and dynamism
or to reduce poverty. Despite an increased emphasis on the social dimensions of development,
there is no consensus on an approach to social policy. Crucial issues include the appropriate
interface between social and economic policies; the role of the state, not just as regulator but
also as a provider of social welfare, and the degree of responsibility that markets and families
should assume in providing services, including care; the scope, design and ﬁnancing of social
policies; and – fundamentally – the values that should underpin public policy, in particular core
values of equality, solidarity and redistribution.
This section lays out an approach to social provisioning and protection rooted in universal values.
It argues that the state must assume key responsibilities in terms of ﬁnancing, administration
and regulation. This contrasts with the orientation of social policy in many developing countries
today, which emphasizes government programmes that target the poor as a supplement to
private or market-led forms of provision and ﬁnance.
When a substantial proportion of a country’s population lives in poverty, targeted interventions
are unlikely to address the underlying causes of poverty or to achieve adequate levels of coverage.
Narrowly targeted social policy interventions are costly, difﬁcult to administer, politically
vulnerable and produce segmented, uncoordinated welfare systems. Similarly, market-based
approaches have a poor record, whether in terms of protection, coverage, redistribution and
gender equity, or in contributing to economic development and stabilization. Furthermore,
ostensibly cost-saving and efﬁciency-enhancing measures, such as user fees for social services,
are inappropriate in developing country contexts where underutilization or lack of quality services
constitute the greater public policy challenges.
This section makes the case for a comprehensive approach to social policy that combines
universal basic social service provision with social protection programmes, both contributory
and non-contributory, along with selective initiatives to reach the most excluded segments of the
population. It examines not only conventional forms of social policy such as social assistance,
insurance and services, but also the unequal burden of unpaid care work, and how this can be
redistributed. It proposes ﬁnancing structures that reinforce progressive redistribution and are
sustainable in economic and political terms.
Such an approach places social policy at the centre of development strategies. It emphasizes the
multiple tasks that social policy performs in relation to social protection, social reproduction,
production and redistribution – tasks that are key to transformative social policy.

CHAPTER

Towards Universal
Social Protection
Protecting people from the vagaries of the market and life’s
changing circumstances is one of the main objectives of
social policy. As a key component of social policy, social
protection is concerned with preventing, managing and
overcoming situations that adversely affect people’s wellbeing. It helps individuals maintain their living standard
when confronted by contingencies such as illness, maternity, disability or old age; market risks, such as unemployment; as well as economic crises or natural disasters.
In the developed world, social protection has traditionally been concerned with temporary or foreseeable income
shortfalls and transitory experiences of poverty in otherwise relatively stable life trajectories and acceptable living
conditions. In developing countries, by contrast, social
protection has recently emerged as a policy framework for
addressing poverty and vulnerability. In contexts where
chronic poverty and persistent deprivation affect large sectors of the population, social protection programmes are
evolving to include elements of promotion as well as protection, with the aim of tackling not only sharp declines in
income but also persistently low incomes and their structural causes. In this sense, social protection is a key component of development policy that can support people in
moving out of poverty and living more digniﬁed and productive lives.
This chapter argues that universal social protection – that
which covers the entire population with adequate beneﬁts and is grounded in claimable entitlements, whether
derived from rights or payments by institutions and individuals – can contribute to human security, reduce poverty
and inequality, and build social solidarity. Universal social
protection in developing countries can help protect living
standards in general and provide basic levels of consumption to those living in, or at risk of falling into, poverty.
Furthermore, it facilitates investment in human and other

5

productive assets that provide escape routes from persistent and intergenerational poverty and that strengthen the
agency of the poor.

Universal social protection can
contribute to human security,
reduce poverty and inequality,
and build social solidarity
Social protection instruments discussed in this chapter
encompass social insurance, social assistance and labour
market standards, with a focus on the ﬁrst two, both of
which are associated with some form of ﬁnancial transfer
or income support. Social insurance refers to employmentrelated programmes ﬁnanced from contributions from
employers and employees based on earnings. Social assistance provides transfers to those who are unable to work or
excluded from gainful employment and who are deemed
eligible, whether on the basis of their income, their vulnerability status or their rights as citizens. Income-generating
interventions such as public employment programmes are
also a form of social assistance. Social assistance is usually
ﬁnanced through general taxation and external resources
(see chapter 8).
Whereas the instruments used for social protection have a
long history, going back to the European welfare states and
before, social protection as a policy approach in the ﬁeld
of development is relatively new, particularly in Asia and
sub-Saharan Africa. It emerged from a context of economic
crisis, structural adjustment and global integration, where
the limitations of residual, ad hoc safety nets to address the
social consequences of neoliberal policies became painfully
apparent. Not surprisingly, this evolving approach to social

135

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

protection is contested. The very purpose and design of
social protection interventions are being scrutinized; the
appropriate division of responsibility among households,
states and markets deliberated; and fundamental principles, such as universalism versus targeting or residualism,
debated. Nonetheless, as an approach, social protection
offers an unprecedented opportunity to integrate concerns
with livelihood security and poverty reduction within a
uniﬁed conceptual and policy framework.1

Social protection offers an
unprecedented opportunity to integrate
concerns with livelihood security and
poverty reduction within a uniﬁed
conceptual and policy framework
As the case studies in this chapter show, a wide range of
instruments and pathways can be used to achieve the goal
of universal social protection. These include measures to
extend the coverage of contributory programmes as well as
to expand social assistance. As the social protection component with the strongest direct impact on poverty reduction,
social assistance has become a focus of major innovation in
recent years,2 and is a core element of national strategies
to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
The evidence in this regard points to the following conclusion: countries that have successfully reduced income poverty and improved social conditions on a signiﬁcant scale
have established comprehensive social protection programmes integrated into broader strategies of social policy
and social development. In contrast, countries that have
adopted social protection approaches emphasizing marketoriented instruments and narrowly targeted interventions
have tended to be less effective in reducing poverty.
The analysis in this chapter highlights the following lessons.
• Achieving universal social protection requires the state
to assume key responsibilities in terms of ﬁnancing,
administering and regulating social protection
programmes and institutions.

136

• Social assistance programmes are most effective when
designed as an integral part of a long-term social
protection strategy, avoiding complex mechanisms of
targeting and conditionality.
• Increased coverage and equity of formal social
insurance schemes can be pursued through
various routes.
• Extending social protection must be an integral part of
efforts to create sustainable and employment-intensive
growth paths and to advance towards more equitable,
cohesive and democratic societies (see chapter 1).
Section 1 of this chapter makes the case for a universal
approach to social protection. It also summarizes evidence
on the positive impact of social protection in reducing
inequality and poverty.
Section 2 examines the changing patterns of social
protection provision in developing countries since the
mid-twentieth century, drawing on the experience of a
number of countries grouped according to their development and growth paths. These examples illustrate how
social protection policies have been forged and adjusted
with different outcomes in contexts of rapid economic and
social transformation.
Section 3 presents policy lessons and recommendations.

1. The Case for Universal
Social Protection
Universal social protection is deﬁned as a minimum level
of income or consumption granted as a right by the state
to all citizens and residents of a country, thus treating
everyone with equal consideration and respect.3 Social
policy grounded in universalism aims to guarantee a decent
standard of living for all, making social services and a basic
income accessible to the entire population. As a normative
principle, universalism is concerned with solidarity and the
notion of social citizenship, which includes social rights

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 5 – TOWARDS UNIVERSAL SOCIAL PROTECTION

alongside civil and political liberties, and emphasizes collective responsibility for individual well-being. Its achievement requires social policies that foster social cohesion and
coalition building among classes, groups and generations,
working against different types of divisions in society.
A key argument running throughout this report is that universalizing the provision of social protection and social services is essential to sustained improvements in well-being.
To understand the potential and challenges involved, this
chapter ﬁrst looks at the evolution of social protection as a
policy approach for development and poverty reduction.

Neoliberal approaches to social protection
fail to deliver on several counts
In the context of crisis, stabilization and adjustment of
the 1980s, social policies were conceived of primarily as
residual interventions to address market failures or to assist
those adversely affected by crisis or unable to beneﬁt from
growth. Within this dominant neoliberal policy agenda,
social protection interventions focused largely on targeted
safety nets for the poor and vulnerable in order to mitigate
the adverse consequences of economic or other shocks.4
By extension, the role of the state was limited to being a
provider of last resort, when individual, community or market responses were inefﬁcient or insufﬁcient. Whereas the
state was responsible for a healthy macroeconomic environment and good governance in general, direct public support occurred only in the form of targeted social assistance
for the neediest groups, alleviating the adverse impact of
crises or catastrophic events. Non-income aspects of social
protection, such as social inclusion and solidarity, were not
considered key elements of a strategy to build people’s ability to climb out of poverty. Rather, they were regarded as
collateral outcomes of good social protection programmes.
The Asian ﬁnancial crisis of 1997–1998 exposed the limits
of such safety net responses, and a new discourse around
social protection emerged that better integrated concerns
with risk and vulnerability. The social risk management
framework that evolved within the World Bank focused on

analysis of risks (such as economic and environmental) and
a set of mechanisms (market and non-market) designed to
reduce, mitigate or cope with risk.5 While this approach
has extended the scope for better ex ante institutional
arrangements, it remains primarily concerned with market mechanisms of provision, supplemented with narrowly
targeted assistance for the most vulnerable.

In practice, the combination of privatization and targeted
public provision against a background of crisis, recession and social sector retrenchment starting in the 1980s
resulted in a lost decade of development in many parts of
the world.6 Market-based approaches to reforming social
protection, including the privatization of health and pension insurance and the introduction of user fees for health
and educational services, have been pervasive in developing countries. These reforms were expected to contribute
to development and well-being simultaneously by creating
more efﬁcient social systems, fewer market distortions and
lower costs for the state. This agenda has failed to deliver,
especially with regard to the extension of coverage, poverty
reduction, broader risk-sharing and redistribution, and gender or other forms of equity.7
For example, funded schemes, such as individual savings
accounts for retirement, sickness or unemployment, are
generally unaffordable for low-income individuals. Moreover, certain categories of people, such as the chronically
ill, may be required to pay more or may be rejected from
private health plans when premiums are adjusted for risk.
Since premiums and beneﬁts are normally earnings-related
and individualized (and therefore do not cover so-called
dependants), they tend to accentuate existing labour market inequalities, such as wage differentials between women

137

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

and men. They also discriminate against those who do not
participate in formal, paid employment (such as caregivers, voluntary workers, the disabled and children). For this
reason, private insurance schemes neither pool certain risks
nor redistribute resources across different sectors of the
population. In many contexts, the proliferation of private
insurance providers has provoked or intensiﬁed the fragmentation of social protection into multiple schemes with
different eligibility rules, contributions and beneﬁt levels.
The result is limited or patchy coverage.

The beneﬁts of narrowly targeting social
assistance are questionable
In response to these widening gaps in coverage, targeted
social protection schemes have expanded dramatically
in recent years, largely through various cash transfer programmes ﬁnanced out of general budget revenues and aid.
Because they do not rely on formal labour relationships
and previous contributions, social assistance programmes
are especially important for low-income countries with
large informal sectors. Such programmes can be used as
a means to extend social protection to sectors of the
population traditionally excluded from statutory contributory social insurance, either because of their informal
employment status or low incomes. They are therefore
an indispensable instrument in a context of permanently
deteriorating labour market conditions and global crisis.
Existing programmes differ widely in terms of objectives
and design, scope and degree of institutionalization. They
include conditional cash transfer or integrated social assistance schemes; income transfers conditional on work, such
as public works or employment guarantee schemes; and
pure income transfers, such as non-contributory social pensions or child beneﬁts (see chapter 7).
The beneﬁts and shortcomings of targeting speciﬁc groups
in these types of programmes remain controversial.8 Targeting on the basis of income usually entails high administrative costs, signiﬁcant errors of inclusion and exclusion, and
substantial undercoverage, while potentially stigmatizing
beneﬁciaries. It tends to foster the segmentation of social

138

protection programmes and the separation of the poor
from other social classes, possibly leading to lower levels of
political and budgetary support, and weaker accountability mechanisms. Income-based targeting can be especially
challenging in contexts where informality and poverty are
widespread, and where governance structures and technical
and administrative competencies are weak. Furthermore,
by de-linking access to social protection from rights of citizenship, targeted schemes enhance the discretionary power
of authorities, especially at the local level, to assign beneﬁts
and may thus create incentives for undesirable behaviour
such as corruption.

Targeting based on income entails high
costs, stigma and fails to reach the poor
The lack of a recognized basis for entitlements can create
the perception that recipients are receiving something for
nothing,9 leading to the criticism of welfare dependency.
This in turn is used to justify the discretionary handling
of beneﬁts by authorities as well as interventions to regulate the behaviour of recipients. While questionable from
a rights-based perspective, such approaches have also led
to the promotion of programme designs with contradictory
effects on poverty and equality. For instance, the conditionalities or co-responsibilities attached to the provision
of cash beneﬁts may require beneﬁciaries to perform certain
veriﬁable actions to secure even minimum investments in
children’s education and health. Such conditionalities may
play a political role in securing broad-based support for these
initiatives from some sectors of the population or external
donors. However, they may also involve erroneous and
troubling assumptions about the causes of poverty and the
behavioural choices of individuals and families. The costs
of compliance with conditionalities may be high, particularly for women, and, in the absence of an adequate supply
of good quality social services, may not lead to the desired
outcomes.10 In some contexts, improvements in basic education and health indicators might be better achieved by
investing resources directly in the supply of these services
(see chapter 6).

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 5 – TOWARDS UNIVERSAL SOCIAL PROTECTION

Universal social protection demands
a strong state role
Achieving universal social protection requires the state to
assume key responsibilities in providing, ﬁnancing, administering and regulating programmes and institutions (see
chapter 10). The experience of welfare regimes in advanced
industrialized economies – in particular the conservativecorporatist (Germany and France) and social democratic
types (the Nordic countries) – shows that public provision
plays a central role in decreasing the dependence of citizens
on market participation to secure livelihoods (decommodiﬁcation) and in preventing them from falling into poverty.
This has been accomplished largely through universal coverage of social protection and social services.11
The role of the state becomes even more important in a
development context. Here, countries often face problems
of weak private markets, especially labour and insurance
markets, thus diminishing the capacity of individuals and
families to compensate for inexistent or insufﬁcient incomes
and social services in highly unequal societies. Some developing countries have established occupational insurance
schemes for some formal labour market workers. However,
in development contexts, social rights and entitlements
are more often grounded within the informal domains of
social relationships and cultural norms, with non-state
actors – such as kin, religious organizations, charities, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and philanthropy –
generally assuming a prominent role in social provision.12
Despite the important role played by such non-state and
private actors in reducing vulnerability and destitution,
as well as in advocating social rights, they cannot act as
substitutes for public action by the state.
Countries where informal welfare mechanisms dominate
have not been successful in achieving sustained poverty
reduction, as the case studies in this chapter will show.
The advantage of the state is that it can provide uniform
standards and universal coverage of social protection,
using different redistribution mechanisms among different groups depending on risks and vulnerabilities, income
and class, gender and ethnicity, and other characteristics.

So while acknowledging the importance of non-state and
informal activities, this chapter focuses on public action for
social protection.
State interventions shape the conditions for the involvement of other actors, directly through regulations and subsidies or indirectly through the design and scope of public
interventions. In turn, they may be shaped by other actors,
either directly (for example, through donor inﬂuence on
national social protection strategies) or indirectly (as when
higher income groups opt out of public social insurance). In
this sense, the speciﬁc welfare mix of any country – that is,
the combination of policies and the roles of various actors
(state, market, household, community, NGO and donor)
in welfare provision – needs to be understood as part of
the broader historical evolution of a country’s development
strategies and policies.

Universal programmes offer greater beneﬁts
The more universal a programme becomes in terms of coverage, rules of access and membership, and adequacy of
beneﬁts, the greater the potential for redistribution, risk
pooling, cross-subsidization, efﬁciency gains and quality
control. The redistributive impact of universal programmes
can be further enhanced through progressive ﬁnancing
mechanisms (see chapter 8).

The more universal a programme
becomes, the greater the potential
for redistribution, risk pooling,
cross-subsidization, efﬁciency gains
and quality control
In practice, in terms of the steps and instruments through
which universal social protection can be achieved, the line
between a universal and a targeted approach may become
blurred.13 The ideal type of a universal social protection programme is a basic income grant for all citizens or

139

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

residents, ﬁnanced out of general revenues and provided
on an unconditional basis (see box 5.1). In practice, however, beneﬁts that cover the working population (often
including dependants), such as social insurance beneﬁts,
or groups, such as non-contributory cash transfers for the
elderly, the disabled or children, are interpreted as groupbased (categorical) universalism. Afﬁrmative action is

deemed a necessary complement to universal programmes,
since universalism strictly interpreted may ignore structural
inequalities based on individual or collective characteristics (such as gender, age, disability or ethnicity; see chapters 3, 4 and 6). This could actually impede individuals or
groups from beneﬁting adequately from a universal social
protection programme.

BOX 5.1. Coping with the global economic crisis: Alternative approaches to social protection
Debate regarding social protection in the context of the global economic crisis has drawn attention to two alternative proposals,
both grounded in a rights-based approach.

A basic income grant is income provided unconditionally to all citizens or residents on an individual basis, without means testing
or a work requirement. Ideally, a basic income grant would replace all other forms of non-contributory social assistance available
in a country, thus avoiding the costs and the stigma associated with means testing, targeting and conditionality. However, current
proposals are focusing on partial schemes that would provide a low – and slowly increasing – basis to which other income, including
remaining social security beneﬁts and means-tested guaranteed income supplements, could be added. Alternatively, grants could
be provided to certain categories ﬁrst (children, the elderly) and then extended progressively to the whole population. Countries that
have experimented with a partial basic income grant include Brazil, where the right to a basic minimum income for all nationals and
residents was legislated in 2004, and Singapore, where, at the end of each ﬁscal year, the state redistributes any national budget
surplus in cash to every citizen as a bonus of citizenship.

The social protection ﬂoor endorsed by the United Nations system in 2009, with the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the
World Health Organization (WHO) designated as lead agencies for its promotion, consists of a guaranteed set of basic social transfers
in cash or in kind to all. Countries may choose how to realize it. Transfers are granted to all residents as a right, and their ﬁnancing
is a collective responsibility, most likely to occur through general taxation. The ILO calculates the initial annual cost for a basic social
protection package – including universal basic old-age and disability pensions, basic child beneﬁts, universal access to essential care
and social assistance/100 days employment scheme – in the range between 3.7 per cent and 10.6 per cent of gross domestic product
(GDP) for a number of low-income countries in 2010. This approach has inspired the United Nations Chief Executives Board to adopt
the social protection ﬂoor as one of its policies to cope with the global crisis.

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 5 – TOWARDS UNIVERSAL SOCIAL PROTECTION

Universal social protection can enhance
economic progress
During the neoliberal adjustment era of the 1980s, mainstream economists criticized public social transfers ﬁnanced
through contributions and general taxes (or debt) for their
rising costs and unsustainable ﬁscal burden, ﬁnancial instability and inefﬁciency (due to adverse incentives on labour
supply, savings and investment). The failure of their alternative residual approach to provide even minimal protection to the vulnerable in the event of crisis and over the
lifecycle has since shifted the focus of attention towards
ways in which social protection policies can favourably
affect social and economic development.

The most prominent argument cites
the positive impact of investments
in education and health on human
capital formation, and hence on
labour productivity

The most prominent argument in contemporary debates
cites the positive impact of investments in education and
health on human capital formation, and hence on labour
productivity (see ﬁgure 5.1 and chapter 6). Social protection
instruments, such as income transfers paid by social health
insurance or social assistance programmes, help poor people
access these services and cover related costs such as transportation, school supplies or medicines. Social assistance further
supports the productivity and health of a population if cash
transfers are invested in nutrition and housing, for example.

Social insurance policies such as pension programmes provide incentives to both employees and employers to undertake long-term investments in skills, allowing ﬁrms to pursue
a pattern of economic specialization based on the production of high-value-added goods, thus inﬂuencing the growth
path of the economy.15 Social protection programmes also
guarantee social reproduction (see chapter 7) in households
that are affected by contingencies or poverty, potentially fostering local development through increased income security
and diversiﬁcation of assets and livelihoods.

productivity and social expenditure per capita

In general, beneﬁts that are not based on means testing or
conditionality and provide coverage across different income
groups can be deﬁned as universal measures.14 Social insurance and publicly funded group-based schemes can therefore be considered steps in the progressive realization of the
right to universal social protection.

macro-policies) are the well-known effects of income
replacement programmes (so-called automatic stabilizers)
on macroeconomic stability. Such programmes, which are
reinforced if accompanied by progressive funding mechanisms, help smooth economic cycles and avoid deﬂationary recessions by stabilizing demand and domestic markets.
Income replacement programmes are not only a source
of ﬁnance (for example, pension funds) and employment (for example, in the social service sector); they
also have a beneﬁcial effect on social cohesion, equity
and political legitimacy, which are key ingredients for an
investor-friendly environment with potentially positive
effects on different types of investments such as foreign
direct investment (FDI). They may also have a positive inﬂuence on individual and institutional behaviour,

141

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

in terms of risk taking, labour mobility, long-term planning, accountability and ﬁnancial sector development.
Finally, the prospect of participating in earnings-related
social protection schemes can contribute to greater labour
market formalization, with possible positive spin-off effects
on income levels and state revenues.

Universal social protection reduces
poverty and inequality
Social protection schemes can be designed to redistribute
vertically (towards low-income groups) and horizontally
(towards groups with speciﬁc risks and vulnerabilities,
such as women with care responsibilities, the disabled and
those who are ill). In combination with progressive funding
mechanisms (for example, progressive income and wealth
taxation, as described in chapter 8), these public tax-transfer schemes have an important redistributive function with
regard to primary distribution resulting from market processes and individual conditions.

Evidence from OECD countries shows that income inequality and poverty rates were signiﬁcantly reduced following the
implementation of tax-transfer schemes, with social democratic welfare states (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden)
being the most successful in producing egalitarian societies
with low poverty rates (see table 5.1). Under this model, a
wide range of health, education and care services, as well as
social protection beneﬁts and transfers, are provided publicly
and universally by the state on the basis of citizenship or
residence, rather than employment status or means testing.16
Table 5.1 shows that poverty rates in social democratic welfare
states were reduced by 78 per cent – from 19 per cent to 4 per
cent of the working age population – following implementation of tax-transfer schemes. By contrast, poverty was reduced
by only 40 per cent among working-age populations in liberal
welfare states (Australia, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States). Moreover, the overall incidence
of poverty post–tax and transfers in these countries was triple
that of the social democratic welfare states. (See chapter 7,
table 7.2 for poverty rates of children and chapter 4, ﬁgure 4.1
for poverty rates of single mothers in OECD countries.)

Social protection programmes also have a clear positive
impact on poverty reduction in developing countries, especially if de-linked from formal labour market participation.
Old-age poverty in Latin America has been reduced by
between 25 and 93 per cent through social transfers (see table
5.2). Figure 5.2 shows that social spending in Latin America
accounts for more than half of the total income of the poorest
income quintile and 30 per cent of the second quintile.

However, the impact of social protection on equality is
mixed, at least for those countries where data are available (see table 5.3 and ﬁgure 5.2). As can be seen in table
5.3, beneﬁts from public social spending in Latin America,
including social protection, are skewed towards higher
income groups, with spending on tertiary education and on
social security being the most regressive. This suggests that
improved access by the poorest quintile to secondary and
tertiary education and to social security programmes will
require a more equal redistribution of resources between
richer and poorer population groups. It also suggests that
social expenditure needs to be redirected to non-contributory programmes that reach the poorest quintiles of
the population and speciﬁc groups that remain excluded
from social insurance mechanisms. This is different from
concentrating expenditures solely on primary health and
education services, which can lead to neglect of curative
health and higher education (see chapter 6).

The impact of social protection schemes on equality
therefore depends on a variety of factors, such as the
pre-existing level and the nature and sources of inequality,
the nature and design of interventions and programmes,
coverage of tax-transfer schemes and the volume of
funds, and progressivity of revenue and expenditure policies. There is also evidence that highly unequal societies
tend to reproduce inequalities through public policies and
institutions due to existing power relations.17 Figure 5.2
shows that, in Latin America, income inequality remains
high even after accounting for redistribution through
public spending.

2. Changing Patterns
of Social Protection
A number of developing and transition countries in Latin
America and Eastern Europe have been implementing social
protection programmes for over a century. The expansion
of social policies accelerated in the post-war period in a
context of greater formalization of employment, which
facilitated extension of social protection to larger segments
of the population. Such protection often included beneﬁts
for dependent spouses and children, but excluded other

144

household members engaged in unpaid care or domestic
work or voluntary community service (see chapter 7).
The evolution of social protection programmes in these
countries, however, in contrast to more developed nations,
has been characterized by frequent disruptions and radical regime shifts, mostly as a result of global development
trends over the past three decades. For the majority of the
developing world (apart from the former socialist countries), the emergence of highly dualist labour market structures, marked by increasing informalization and high levels
of unemployment, has also undermined the construction
and ﬁnancing of universal social protection measures.
These tendencies were reinforced during the recent period
of globalization, especially following the ﬁrst debt crisis of
the early 1980s and the breakdown of the socialist bloc at
the end of the decade. This period saw a decline in security even in countries with relatively more advanced social
policy regimes, such as some Latin American or former
socialist countries. As discussed earlier in this chapter, rising insecurity, highlighted particularly by the Asian ﬁnancial crisis, focused attention on the dire consequences for
human development and growth of inadequate protection
mechanisms. As a result, a new social protection discourse
emerged that emphasized the need for institutionalized and
state-sponsored programmes on a larger scale.

The remainder of this section examines how different social
protection programmes have evolved across countries and
areas, and over time, through the interplay of a variety
of factors. These include the development model, labour
market and social policies, and political variables, including prevailing ideas, institutions, interests and actors.18
The case studies will show the role social protection (along
with other dimensions of social policy analysed in subsequent chapters) has played in these contexts to prevent
and reduce poverty, as well as to contribute to equality and
social inclusion.

Various routes to universal social protection exist
Social protection in the context of
developmentalism and industrialization
The Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China are
among the most advanced areas of East Asia, catching up
successfully in recent decades through a manufacturing-led
development path. The expansion of formal employment
accompanied by steeply rising incomes has led to a reduction in poverty levels and improvements in social indicators (see chapter 1).19 The welfare regime in both places is
organized around core social insurance programmes (related
to health, old-age, disability, work accidents, unemployment, maternity and survivor beneﬁts) which were gradu-

ally expanded in the late 1980s and 1990s. This East Asian
social policy model has been labelled productivist or developmental, given its emphasis on the instrumental role of
social policy for economic development, its focus on labour
productivity (health and education) and support for workers in strategic sectors. Other aspects of social policy, such
as income support schemes, have until recently been underdeveloped, with citizens relying principally on the family or
private savings.20
Republic of Korea. The country introduced earningsrelated social insurance programmes in the 1960s under
authoritarian rule. By the late 1990s, during the period
of democratic transition, reforms in health, pension and
unemployment insurance programmes, as well as the
introduction of a Minimum Living Standard Guarantee,
increased the coverage and equity of the social protection
system (see table 5.4).
Driven by demands from labour unions and civil society
organizations, multiple health insurance funds were merged
into a single integrated public scheme at the end of the
1990s by the reformist government led by President Kim
Dae-Jung. Health reform had beneﬁcial effects both in terms
of efﬁciency (administrative costs decreased from 11.4 per
cent of total expenditures in 1997 to 4.7 per cent in 2003)21
and equity, since entitlement conditions were equalized

145

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

(though premiums remain different), beneﬁting previously
disadvantaged rural workers and the self-employed.22 Despite
the fact that contributory health insurance is now almost
universal in terms of membership coverage, it still relies
heavily on regressive out-of-pocket payments (accounting
for an estimated 50 per cent of total national health expenditures)23 and private service delivery.
The Minimum Living Standards Guarantee scheme and
labour insurance reforms were introduced in the aftermath
of the Asian ﬁnancial crisis of 1997–1998. The former established a basic living standard as a civil right and adjusted
beneﬁts to a new poverty line, reaching 1.5 million people
(3.19 per cent of the population) in 2007.24 The latter provided cash beneﬁts, job training and small loans to unemployed temporary workers.25 Finally, universal coverage for
old-age security (including farmers and the self-employed,
but exempting the special regimes for civil servants, the
military and private school teachers) was achieved after
incorporating the large group of urban self-employed in
1999. There are not yet signs of ﬁscal pressures from the
pension scheme, which is still in its build-up phase. However, they could arise in the future, since many temporary
workers fail to pay their contributions (see table 5.4).26
Taiwan Province of China. In line with the sequenced
development of social insurance typical of corporatist welfare models, Taiwan Province of China started in the 1950s
by providing social insurance to strategic groups, such as
workers in state-owned enterprises, key private industries,
the civil service, the military and teachers.27 Coverage of
social protection schemes remained incomplete until the
1990s. The ﬁrst universal programme, National Health
Insurance, was introduced in 1995: it covers the entire
population, with the government contributing part of the
funding, not only for public employees but also for the selfemployed, informal workers and farmers.28 As in the Republic of Korea, the push for social sector reform occurred in
a context of industrial restructuring, rising unemployment
rates and democratic transition. Faced with rising wages,
Taiwanese ﬁrms increasingly relocated their businesses to
mainland China. The province was less affected by the Asian
ﬁnancial crisis than the Republic of Korea. Nonetheless,

146

in response to rising unemployment, economic downturn
and structural transformation after the crisis, the Employment Insurance Programme was introduced in 1999, offering temporary cash beneﬁts and training programmes.
Challenges remain in the fragmented Taiwanese pension
system. The main problems are a lack of annuity payments
(lump-sum payments are the rule, except for civil servants,
who receive life-long pensions) and non-compliance of private employers with regard to occupational pensions. This
has resulted in low coverage levels, with 38 per cent of men
and 69 per cent of women over age 65 relying on their children for support.29 However, different types of tax-ﬁnanced
social pensions have been established for poor senior citizens, farmers and war veterans.
The examples of the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China show that, in a context of sufﬁciently formalized labour markets, extension of formal social insurance
is indeed possible and is also in line with a developmentalist orientation of social policy. Yet these achievements
were initiated under authoritarian regimes, giving rise to
debates about a possible trade-off between economic and
social development versus human rights and democracy.
It is worth noting, however, that the expansion of social
protection was closely linked to labour mobilization and,
ultimately, democratic transition. Indeed, new political
and civil society actors have facilitated the expansion of
non-contributory programmes for old-age, poverty and
unemployment, moving these two Asian Tigers towards a
more socially inclusive welfare model. Signiﬁcantly, recent
evidence suggests that such programmes have helped them
become more resilient and responsive to affected citizens in
the event of crisis.

The Republic of Korea and Taiwan
Province of China show that, in a
context of sufﬁciently formalized
labour markets, extension of formal
social insurance is possible

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 5 – TOWARDS UNIVERSAL SOCIAL PROTECTION

Social protection in dualist contexts
Argentina, Brazil and South Africa are middle-income
countries and growth poles in their respective regions,
although their development paths have been characterized
as stalled industrialization,30 and their human development
achievements vary considerably. Argentina ranks high on
the human development index (HDI), Brazil ranks high to
middle, and South Africa has achieved only medium scores
due to the legacy of apartheid and the AIDS epidemic.
The inability of these countries to complete the process of
industrial transformation and the adoption of neoliberal
adjustment policies has resulted in dualist labour markets:
formal sector workers enjoy protection for a variety of
risks and generous beneﬁts through social insurance, while
informal workers are excluded and marginally covered by
social assistance programmes. However, the three countries display major differences. Development in Argentina
has been regressive since the era of neoliberal adjustment,
moving from a comprehensive welfare state towards a
model characterized by fragmentation, underfunding and
increasing exclusion. Brazil appears to be moving towards a
more inclusive welfare model in the process of democratic
consolidation. South Africa, which has traditionally had
low coverage in terms of contributory social insurance programmes, relies heavily on means-tested social assistance
beneﬁts to provide minimum protection to its poor.
Argentina. Argentina achieved high employment levels
and quasi-universal coverage of public social services and
social protection schemes in the late 1960s, with free health
and education services at all levels provided and ﬁnanced
by the state. It subsequently experienced multiple economic
and political crises, including a highly repressive military
dictatorship during the 1970s and 1980s and hyperinﬂation by the end of the lost decade. The country underwent
neoliberal shock therapy in the 1990s, ironically under a
Peronist government – the political party traditionally associated with the working classes, whose founder, General
Juan Perón, had spearheaded expansion of social policies
as part of his authoritarian-populist developmental state
in the 1940s and 1950s. The neo-Peronist government
of Carlos Menem (1989–1999) combined Washington
consensus reforms with a rigid monetary stabilization plan

(a currency board model based on parity of the Argentine
peso with the dollar) in order to achieve rapid price and
exchange rate stability and access to international capital
markets. Since the new economic model could only work in
a context of wage ﬂexibility, balanced ﬁscal accounts and a
strong ﬁnancial sector, a range of social sector reforms were
introduced with the aim of supporting these goals. These
included the introduction of mandatory private pension
funds, deregulation of the union-administered health insurance system, decentralization of public health and education
facilities, privatization of social services such as water and
sanitation, and reforms in labour market regulation and collective bargaining.31 These radical policy shifts had drastic
consequences for equity and social protection.32 Coverage
of the labour force in the pension system in 2004 declined
by half (based on active contributors) to 25 per cent,33 while
health insurance coverage declined by 11 per cent over the
period 1991 to 2001.34
After the 2001 Argentine state bankruptcy – the largest
sovereign default in history – a combination of public emergency programmes and self-help activism at the community
level helped overcome a deep economic and social crisis.
Argentina’s main emergency programme, Programa Jefes y
Jefas de Hogar Desocupados, was set up in 2002 to support
people who had lost their jobs and savings. It served to control an explosive social and political situation and to secure
the legitimacy of the appointed transition government in
the face of massive street protests by organized groups of
the unemployed.35
Since its inception, the Jefas programme has been sponsored by the World Bank through concessional loans, and
reached around 2 million applicants in its ﬁrst year; by 2009,
the number of beneﬁciaries had been reduced to about
620,000. The programme provides a payment of $50 per
month to the unemployed head of a household (not covered by other contributory social insurance schemes) with
children under 18, disabled dependents of any age and/or a
pregnant woman, in exchange for a minimum of four hours
of daily work. Its objective is not only to promote school
attendance and health care among a household’s children,
but to encourage beneﬁciaries to enrol in formal education

147

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

or take up training courses that will enable them to re-enter
the labour market or to become involved in productive
activities or community service. Despite the programme’s
visible impact on extreme poverty, which blunted the most
negative effects of the crisis,36 it has not been able to guarantee access to good quality, well-paid and stable employment. On the contrary, the relatively low level of beneﬁts
has forced beneﬁciaries to seek complementary incomes in
the informal sector.37 Once social and economic recovery
were under way, new social assistance programmes were
introduced to facilitate the social inclusion of vulnerable
families receiving beneﬁts under the Jefas programme.
These included Plan Familias, a conditional cash transfer
programme, and Seguro de Capacitación y Empleo, insurance for training and employment.
Brazil. Brazil is considered another pioneer in the introduction of public social insurance programmes in Latin America. It uniﬁed and centralized social protection programmes
under a technocratic military dictatorship that took power
in 1964 and expanded coverage to peasants, family workers
and domestic workers in the 1970s. In the 1990s, it chose a
different reform pathway from that of Argentina, reﬂecting
the need to balance the competing pressures of democratization (after two decades of authoritarian rule) and economic liberalization.
Through a pragmatic path of gradual change, labelled “the
political economy of the possible”,38 Brazil has implemented
market-oriented reforms, while simultaneously paying tribute to a previously neglected social agenda, emphasizing
social justice and citizenship rights, as enshrined in the new
democratic constitution of 1988. Whereas the two presidential terms of social democrat Fernando Henrique Cardoso
were mainly associated with economic stabilization and
structural reform, a broad electorate called for greater social
inclusion and economic recovery when they voted in the
founder of the Left-wing Workers’ Party, Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva, as president in 2002. To the relief of investors, Lula
combined orthodox economic policy with gradual social
changes, such as reforming a regressive pension regime and
expanding progressive social assistance programmes targeted
to the poor. These include the conditional cash transfer

148

programme, Bolsa Familia, which provides a monthly transfer to poor households with children up to 15 years of age
or pregnant women, and a monthly transfer to extremely
poor households regardless of their composition (table 5.5).
The two transfers can be combined when households fulﬁl
requirements for both. In the ﬁrst type of transfer, conditionalities include 85 per cent school attendance for schoolage children, updated immunization cards for children up to
six years of age and regular visits to health centres for breastfeeding or pregnant women. For the transfer targeted to the
extreme poor, loosely enforced conditionalities involve
participation in training programmes.

Brazil’s current social agenda
emphasizes social justice and
citizenship rights
In 2006, Bolsa Familia reached more than 11 million households through cash transfers, beneﬁting some 40 million
people. Despite its targeted approach and the failure to
complement the initiative with more structural interventions to provide employment opportunities and long-term
solutions to poverty, Bolsa Familia, along with Mexico’s
Oportunidades – the second largest conditional cash transfer programme in Latin America in terms of coverage –
demonstrate that a large portion of the population can be
reached through this type of social assistance, visibly affecting redistribution and poverty.39 As table 5.5 shows, the
ﬁnancial investment in both of these programmes as a percentage of GDP is relatively small, though administrative
costs for targeting and monitoring conditionalities can be
substantial, especially when multiple beneﬁts are provided
to respond to different household needs, as in the case of the
Mexican programme. Nevertheless, several other features
of these programmes, including national ownership of their
design, their long-term political commitment, their rigorous
monitoring and evaluation of processes and outcomes, and
the progressive involvement of beneﬁciaries in monitoring
and governance mechanisms make Bolsa Familia and its
Mexican counterpart the most promising examples among
current conditional cash transfer programmes.

In addition to conditional cash transfers, Brazil has basic
pension programmes ﬁnanced through tax revenues and
some social security contributions.40 The rural pension
scheme, founded in 1963, provides some 7.3 million beneﬁciaries (the elderly, widows and invalids) with pensions
at the minimum wage level without recourse to earnings or
inactivity tests.41 Consequently, overall poverty rates and
inequality have decreased, though the amount of spending on redistributive pension programmes is still very small
if compared to the pension scheme for civil servants
(Brazil spends 0.5 per cent of GDP on social pensions versus
3.8 per cent for civil servants).42
Under Lula’s government, some progress has been
achieved in terms of poverty reduction and equality at

the same time that democracy is being consolidated.43
The challenge ahead is to tackle the structural causes of
inequality and poverty, which aredeeply entrenched
in the country’s economic model and system of social
stratiﬁcation.

Brazil’s Bolsa Familia programme
and Mexico’s Oportunidades are
the most promising examples
among current conditional cash
transfer programmes

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

South Africa. Like Brazil, South Africa’s approach to
social policy must be situated in a context of political
transition and economic adjustment. After coming to
power, the government of the African National Congress (ANC) committed itself to poverty reduction,
better income distribution, lower unemployment levels
and increased social assistance.44 As in Brazil, the commitment towards social justice and social inclusion is ﬁrmly
anchored in the new constitution, which establishes
the universal right to social security.45 Social protection
in South Africa is largely focused on social assistance
programmes, whereas the role of contributory social insurance is much smaller than in the Latin American countries
discussed above.

Expenditure on social assistance programmes is relatively
high, accounting for 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2006. A quarter of the population received a monthly grant paid out
of general taxation in 2006. This totalled 11 million
beneﬁts, divided among the child support grant, disability and care dependency grants and social pensions
(ﬁgure 5.3). Old-age pensions accounted for 37 per cent of
total expenditure on social assistance, child support grants
31 per cent and disability grants 25 per cent.46 These
programmes, especially the old-age pensions, have a
substantial mitigating effect on poverty in South Africa,
reducing both the poverty headcount and the poverty
gap.47 It is estimated that the share of social assistance
going to the poorest income quintile was a steady 60 per
cent between 1993 and 2000.48 South Africa’s meanstested social pensions, paid to men and women starting
from the age of 60, have been found to reduce the country’s
overall poverty gap by 21 per cent, and by 54 per cent for
households with older people.49 They sustain consumption,
provide resources to be invested in small-scale economic
activities and support job searching by other members of
the household. Evidence also shows that social pensions are
frequently shared with family members and often invested
in the next generation. This function becomes even more
important in a country where the incidence of HIV/AIDS,
especially among adults, is transforming the nature of the
family and household into elder-headed units of grandparents and grandchildren.

In South Africa, a quarter of the
population received a monthly social
assistance grant paid out of general
taxation in 2006
On the other hand, South Africa has only a minimal formal
social insurance programme. Mandatory contributions are
limited to the Unemployment Insurance Fund, which covers
formal sector workers, including agricultural and domestic
workers. Beneﬁciaries of the fund account for only 5 per cent
of the unemployed. Private sector pension and provident
funds also exist, with 9 million active contributors. The biggest is the Government Employees Pension Fund. Concerns
have been raised, however, about the semi-voluntary nature
of pension schemes, the coverage gap (at least 40 per cent of
formal sector workers are not covered, and an even smaller
share of the unemployed and informal workers contribute),50
the withdrawal of savings prior to retirement and the governance structures and investment policies of pension funds.51

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 5 – TOWARDS UNIVERSAL SOCIAL PROTECTION

In sum, South Africa’s social policy is considered to be progressive and fairly effective in terms of poverty reduction.
However, it has signiﬁcant coverage gaps and low public
involvement in social insurance programmes. Like its dualist counterparts in Latin America, South Africa shares the
challenge of tackling persistent (though different) labour
market problems as a precondition for extending contributory programmes. In South Africa, these problems relate
to exclusion from labour markets and unemployment; in
Argentina and Brazil, they encompass unfavourable inclusion (low wages and precarious conditions) and informality of labour. Heavy reliance on social assistance in South
Africa and Brazil means that a considerable portion of the
population survives at very low levels of income and is
unable to reap the beneﬁts of a growing economy, which
is still reproducing entrenched patterns of inequality and
social exclusion. As a possible alternative, basic income
schemes grounded in citizenship are being discussed in all
three countries. However, controversy surrounds the ﬁscal
feasibility and general desirability of such an approach, and
political commitment is weak (see box 5.1).52

Social protection in agrarian-informal contexts
Though there are signiﬁcant differences in the structure
and size of their economies, India and the United Republic of Tanzania share similar challenges in terms of social
development and social protection. In both countries, agricultural and informal employment are dominant, creating
formidable obstacles to extending coverage of social insurance programmes, and public expenditures for social services and non-contributory programmes are low.
India. India’s economy is characterized by a growth-intensive service sector offering few jobs, a small manufacturing
sector characterized by jobless growth and a large informal
agricultural sector, where the majority of the population
works (see chapter 1). In India, work-based entitlements
funded through statutory contributions by employers and
employees were introduced in the early phase of industrialization. The goal was to promote the commitment of the
workforce to industrial and urban life and the loyalty of
employees against unionization. Today, such entitlements

are available only to a minority of the workforce who
have a formal employment relationship, while public
sector employees are fully covered by special schemes.53
For instance, the Employees’ Social Insurance scheme
provides health care and cash beneﬁts in cases of sickness,
maternity, death or disability to around 8 per cent of the
labour force.54
For the rest of the workforce and citizens not in paid
employment, protection is provided in the form of social
assistance (though there are signs of growing emphasis on the expansion of social insurance). Social assistance is either through national programmes, such as the
National Employment Guarantee Programme, or through
a multiplicity of state programmes. Since 2004, India has
implemented the National Rural Employment Guarantee
Programme, a social assistance programme that aims to
ensure basic income security for vulnerable households.
Initially it was intended to provide a guarantee of 100 days
of labour in the 200 most backward districts, for one adult
per household prepared to do unskilled manual labour for
the minimum wage. In 2006–2007, the programme generated 905 million person days of labour for 200 districts.
The scheme was subsequently extended to 330 districts and
produced 1.4 billion person days of work in 2007–2008.
In fact, the number of people who completed 100 days of
work rose from 2.1 million (10 per cent of all participating
households) in 2006–2007 to 3.5 million (11 per cent of all
households) in 2007–2008.55
Some observers have questioned the process by which funds
are allocated from central government to Indian states and
have cited the dangers of petty corruption. They have also
expressed doubts and concerns about the capacity of the
programme to generate valuable public assets, low awareness of the programme in areas where it is being implemented, and cost.56
Besides social assistance, India has made efforts to expand
social insurance schemes for speciﬁc groups of informal
workers living in households under the poverty line. These
efforts came together in 2000 under the Janashree Bima
Yojana (JBY) scheme. Households contribute a fraction of

151

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

the premium for disability and survivorship insurance and
additional contributions come from state government and
other agencies; the other 50 per cent is drawn from the central government’s social security fund. A successful feature
of this scheme is the provision of a scholarship for students
in deﬁned educational levels whose parents are covered by
the JBY, without an additional premium. As of 2005–2006,
around 6.5 million informal workers across India were
incorporated. However, this represents just 1.7 per cent of
the estimated total number of informal workers and coverage of risks is incomplete.
The multiplicity of programmes found in India to protect
uncovered citizens demonstrates an effort to tackle the
issue at both the central and local levels. However, it also
reveals the lack of a consistent policy around a well-deﬁned
and uniform design for social security, capable of exploiting synergies among the different forms of social protection
available. Against the backdrop of a relatively favourable

macroeconomic environment and ﬁscal accounts, scaling
up efforts towards progressive extension and uniﬁcation
of insurance schemes in India to achieve a universal
and more equitable system should not only be desirable,
but also possible.
United Republic of Tanzania. The United Republic of
Tanzania is a low-income country where high growth rates
since the 1990s have failed so far to deliver sustained poverty reduction and social development (see ﬁgure 5.4). The
shift from pro-poor economic policies implemented by the
socialist party in the 1970s and 1980s to a market-driven
economy in the late 1980s and 1990s did not have a signiﬁcant impact on efforts to reduce poverty. Table 5.6 illustrates
the low decline in poverty rates and the insufﬁcient performance in non-income indicators compared to the goals
set by the MDGs. Agriculture and agro-processing remain
the largest economic sector, accounting for 45 per cent of
GDP and 74.2 per cent of total employment.57

all government expenditure, with child beneﬁts going to
just under one million children.60 With the state playing
a residual role, the provision of cash transfers, in-kind
assistance, services and capacity building by national and
international NGOs with funding from international
donors is signiﬁcant, though largely undocumented and
with low coverage rates since these efforts are mainly
targeted at the community level.61

Source: UNRISD elaboration, with data from United Republic of Tanzania (2007).

In the United Republic of Tanzania, high rates of informal employment (representing 94 per cent of the country’s
workforce in 2005–200658) pose signiﬁcant challenges to
the extension of social protection. Indeed, social security is
characterized by limited coverage in terms of membership,
scope and access to beneﬁts, with less than 1 per cent of
the entire population and about 6.5 per cent of the formal
working population reached by social insurance schemes.59
The majority of those employed in the informal economy
have limited access to public health care services, and generally rely on traditional and informal intra-family or intracommunity networks for income support during old age or
upon becoming sick or disabled.

In the United Republic of Tanzania,
high rates of informal employment pose
signiﬁcant challenges to the extension

Public social assistance is targeted to vulnerable groups
(people with disabilities, the elderly and vulnerable
children); in 2006/2007, it represented 1.7 per cent of

Free access to public health services is limited in the
United Republic of Tanzania due to the introduction of
user fees during the 1990s and inadequate coverage of
social insurance funds. As a result, community and informal insurance mechanisms, such as community health
funds and funeral associations, have proliferated. In community health funds, households or individuals contribute
according to their capacity rather than a fee-for-service
basis. Membership fees are matched by government subsidies encouraging people to join, ensuring the fund’s sustainability. Less than 10 per cent of households have enrolled
in this type of scheme, representing 2 per cent of government expenditure.62
Such forms of collective and informal welfare can be effective in protecting their members against various contingencies. However, due to their fragmentation, limited resources,
scale, coverage and risk pooling, they cannot provide comprehensive and sustainable solutions to the structural social
needs of the population. Nor can they compensate for the
inability of the state to deliver universal social rights.
The United Republic of Tanzania has a comparatively narrower ﬁscal space and a less favourable macroeconomic
context than India. Yet recent studies have shown that a
minimum package of social protection beneﬁts, including
targeted social assistance, universal old-age pensions and
child beneﬁts could be affordable, costing just over 1.8 per
cent of GDP annually in the longer term.63 However, given
the country’s current dependency on donor funding for its
social expenditures (33 per cent of all budgeted revenue
and 12 per cent of GDP), efforts to build a more comprehensive and inclusive social protection system will inevitably rely on the delivery of donor commitments.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Costa Rica. Costa Rica has been labelled the social democratic model of Latin America. It has achieved high levels of development, social inclusion and democratization,
ranking 54 among 182 countries in the 2009 HDI. Its
performance in terms of social indicators is much higher
than would be expected for its per capita income.64 This is
largely the result of universal social policies and resulting
low levels of inequality and informality.
Initially, in the post-war era, Costa Rica pursued a development path led by agriculture and import-substituting
industrialization policies. Following the economic crisis in
the early 1980s, the country diversiﬁed its productive sector. New activities in the service sector, such as tourism and
ﬁnance, as well as the expansion of export-processing zones,
are responsible for recent positive growth and the creation
of new employment opportunities. However, inequalities
have risen and a high dependence on imports of intermediate and capital goods is resulting in persistent trade deﬁcits.
The expansion of social policy from 1950 to 1980 was
supported by domestically driven economic growth, in
which the role for the state was prominent and connected
to increasing salaries and the expansion of wage labour.65
Costa Rica has also beneﬁted from a democratic trajectory,
which dates back to 1889, and the abolition of the country’s
military in 1949. State bureaucrats initially took the lead in
promoting a central role of the state in welfare provision
and social protection in particular. However, since the neoliberal reforms and retrenchment of the 1980s, civil society
and labour movements have gained signiﬁcant leverage.
The main features of the Costa Rican social model – forged
around the right to basic social citizenship – are a strong
commitment to universal education and health care as well
as efforts to constantly expand pension and health care coverage, reaching universality (see ﬁgure 5.5).66 Extension of
coverage is pursued by expanding the number of workers
contributing to social insurance schemes, while securing protection for those unable to contribute through social assistance. Speciﬁcally, the Costa Rican system has constantly
raised wage-ceilings for mandatory contributions of salaried

154

workers, introduced ﬁrst voluntary and then mandatory
afﬁliation for the self-employed, and established collective
insurance for non-wage workers through cooperatives.67

Towards a universal social protection model

Source: MIDEPLAN-SIDES 2009b.

Costa Rica has expanded social
insurance coverage while securing
protection through social assistance
for those unable to contribute
Targeted social assistance was introduced in Costa Rica during the 1970s as a complement to universal services and
insurance schemes. For more than 30 years, family allowances
have been at the centre of social assistance, representing
annual average spending of 0.4 per cent of GDP. This funds
a number of programmes, including transfers for families and
old-age social insurance, non-contributory health care and
other services, such as school meals and nutrition centres.
Total spending on social assistance as a proportion of GDP
is very high (5.6 per cent of GDP in 2008, as shown in table
5.7), especially when compared to the other countries analysed in this chapter. In addition, funding for social assistance
in Costa Rica relies on payroll taxes for more than two-thirds
of its budget, which requires a strong element of solidarity and
redistribution across workers and citizens in general.

The expansion of coverage increased more rapidly from the
1970s onwards and was maintained during the crisis of the
1980s. In contrast to the retrenchment trends experienced
by the rest of Latin America, radical privatization of public
social insurance was never considered an option. In terms
of pensions, Costa Rica did not follow the Chilean model
of privately managed savings accounts, but reformed its
pension system in 2000 by introducing a compulsory second pillar based on private savings accounts (so-called fully
funded pensions) in addition to the public pay-as-you-go
(PAYG) scheme. Costa Rica avoided some of the pitfalls
associated with multi-pillar pension reforms: since contributions remained unchanged in the public scheme and
the funded pillar was ﬁnanced by employers’ contributions,
no transition costs occurred. Meanwhile, the conservation
of the public – earnings – related pension beneﬁt plus social
pensions prevented a decrease in coverage rates.68
Labour market informality, reaching 39.9 per cent of total
urban employment in 2005, is low compared to other Latin
American countries such as Argentina and Brazil (with
shares of 43.6 and 49.1 per cent, respectively).69 Still, considerable efforts have been made to include groups typically

thought of as difﬁcult to cover, such as the self-employed,
domestic workers and peasants, into formal pension schemes.
Afﬁliation is obligatory and the state subsidizes a portion of
the contribution, leading to relatively high rates of coverage for these groups (24, 39 and 44 per cent, respectively).70
In terms of covering low-income groups, 50 per cent of the
poorest quintile in Costa Rica contributed to a pension
scheme in 2004, while the ﬁgure ranges between 1 per cent
and 25 per cent in other countries in the region.71
By 2007, retirement insurance covered 53.6 per cent of
the economically active population, and health insurance
reached 61.9 per cent of the same group.72 Income poverty
decreased from an estimated 29 per cent of the population in 1987 to 20.2 per cent in 2006, with a decrease in
extreme poverty from 9.1 per cent in 1987 to 5.3 per cent
in 2006.73 More recently, efforts to facilitate the participation of speciﬁc vulnerable and excluded groups (women,
children and teenagers, indigenous communities, the elderly and the disabled) in the design and monitoring of public policies as well as the negotiation of social pacts show
that bottom-up approaches to social reform are becoming
more prominent.74

155

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

In short, Costa Rica has been pursuing a heterodox development model entailing redistributive public investment
and deliberate efforts to combine economic growth with
social development and welfare. Improvements in living
conditions within a favourable economic environment
have allowed the country to become more socially and
politically integrated, and have fostered social mobility.75
Still, the country faces new sets of challenges, such as the
expansion of unemployment and the informal economy,
the persistence of ﬁscal deﬁcits and growing trade deﬁcits,
the growing importance of out-of-pocket expenditures for
health, and the increasing role of private actors in both the
funding and delivery of health services.

comprehensive public social protection programmes, that
are committed to expanding coverage and improving
equity, and that have the political and ﬁscal resources to
do so. The opposite route – bottom-up universalization –
involves the integration and scaling-up of local programmes
and is often discussed as a viable path for poorer countries
characterized by multiple, fragmented and largely informal
protection mechanisms. However, the ﬁscal and administrative challenges in terms of standardization, uniﬁcation
and institutionalization are steep.

3. Instituting Universal
Social Protection:
Implications for Policy

In all of the case studies presented, recent expansion of
social assistance programmes was aimed at overcoming
obstacles to social protection imposed by persistent (or, in
the case of East Asia, more recent) labour market problems. Non-contributory tax-ﬁnanced protection schemes,
including public works programmes and different types
of cash transfer programmes for the poor and vulnerable,
are especially important in contexts where the informal
economy is widespread, where the majority of the population work in the agricultural sector, and where chronic
poverty and persistent deprivation affect large sectors of
the population. In these settings, social protection must
include components that promote sustainable livelihoods,
with the aim of enhancing people’s living conditions on a
more permanent basis.

Social protection programmes are crucial instruments providing an income or access to other resources in times of
need. They enhance people’s well-being throughout their
lives and enable them to cope with contingencies or shocks.
Such programmes have the potential to reduce poverty in
all its dimensions, contributing to more equal and socially
inclusive societies. Social protection is particularly important for developing countries, since it has beneﬁcial effects
on productivity as well as economic and political stability,
and can cushion the adverse social effects of rapid structural change, including those associated with migration,
unemployment, rising inequalities and pandemics.
An analysis of social protection across selected countries
shows that the extension of social insurance and social
assistance can follow various paths. These depend on
policy choices as well as the nature of existing institutions,
the level of economic development and ﬁscal space, and
features of social and economic transformation. One route
to universality may be through top-down universalization
with the expansion of public programmes. This is more
likely to occur in countries that can build on a legacy of

156

Where poverty is widespread, social
protection programmes should promote
sustainable livelihoods and redistribution

In a development context, social protection goes beyond
income maintenance and must also tackle persistently low
incomes and their structural causes, therefore promoting
human capabilities, sustainable livelihoods and redistribution. The provision of an income source to poor and vulnerable households through the social assistance programmes
reviewed in this chapter is a step in the right direction. The
case of South Africa shows that these transfers reduce poverty, sustain consumption, foster investment and encourage labour market participation by recipients and other
household members. Social pensions are frequently shared

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 5 – TOWARDS UNIVERSAL SOCIAL PROTECTION

with other household members, often children, thereby
improving intergenerational justice. As Brazil and Mexico
demonstrate (see table 5.5), the impact of cash transfer programmes on the broader national poverty headcount and
inequality indicators is likely to be stronger and sustained
when their residual and targeted nature, aimed at the poorest individuals and households, is mitigated by extensive
coverage and consistent long-term ﬁnancial investment.

A rights-based approach to
social protection should seek to limit
conditionality and targeting
The evidence presented in this chapter supports the case
for the provision of cash transfers or a basic income on a
universal, stable and long-term basis. In addition, a social
protection approach grounded in the recognition of basic
human rights, and the understanding that individuals and
households make rational decisions for themselves, should
limit the use of conditionality whenever possible. Cash
transfer programmes, such as child beneﬁts (see chapter 7)
and social old-age pensions, based on categorical targeting
rather than means testing, seem to be promising instruments for the extension of social protection in developing countries. The rural pension scheme in Brazil is a good
example, together with pension schemes based on citizenship, as in Bolivia (see chapter 8) and several sub-Saharan
African countries.
Public works programmes in Argentina and India have
proved to be good buffers in times of crisis. They are effective in reaching informal labourers with no access to other
formal social programmes. However, they display a limited
ability to provide sustainable and durable solutions to poverty and inequality. Work is provided for short periods of
time and the wage rate is set at a value below equivalent
market wages to attract only those in desperate need. This
may entail ineffective targeting in those cases where only
individuals who can access other sources of incomes are
actually able to take up low-paid public works. However,
the initiatives reviewed seem to indicate that some degree
of policy learning is taking place, since the programmes

include new efforts to promote labour market mobility
for unskilled workers through training. Yet where unemployment is structural, providing adequate skills for which
unmet demand does exist will need to be combined with
expenditure-side and regulatory policies to promote the
demand for labour.

Social assistance should be complemented
by policies that promote redistribution
and decent work
Even a well-designed and well-performing social assistance programme – or sets of these – will have a limited
impact on vulnerability, poverty and inequality unless
complemented by broader interventions that address the
structural conditions that affect an individual’s ability to
live a decent life. Such interventions include broader social
policy efforts (described throughout this report), such as
land reform, promotion of rural livelihoods, care services,
active labour market policies and support to small- and
medium-sized enterprises. Such policies aim to expand
social and economic opportunities for the most disadvantaged and facilitate the pursuit of a sustained growth path
to create a favourable environment for decent employment
and income generation. Indeed, more people earning a living within conditions of decent work also allows the state
to base social policies on sustainable funding mechanisms
that promote solidarity and reduce ﬁnancial and political
dependence on external resources (see chapter 8).

Even a well-designed social
assistance programme will have
limited impact unless complemented
by broader interventions that
address structural conditions
Best practices in the extension of formal social insurance
schemes are numerous, as the examples in this chapter have
shown. They include speciﬁc measures for difﬁcult-to-cover

157

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

groups, such as mandatory legal coverage, regulation and
supervision of compliance with contribution payments
(by employers, employees and the self-employed); subsidies for low-income groups; and special incentives to join
insurance programmes, such as free additional beneﬁts
(for example, family allowances or scholarships) or coverage of dependants. Moreover, most countries not only aim
to extend coverage, but to harmonize and unify fragmented
systems in order to lower costs and increase equity.
Although social policy is implemented at the country
level, global actors such as international organizations and
donors play an important role. As this chapter shows, they
shape global debates on social protection, the international
normative framework and global funding for social protection initiatives. The international ﬁnancial institutions in
particular pushed for reform models to be adopted in the
developing world, as in Latin America and sub-Saharan
Africa, which have proved detrimental for social development and poverty reduction. International actors respecting countries’ development strategies and supporting

158

democratic political institutions and policy frameworks are
likely to have a stronger positive impact on social development and democratization.
The varieties of policy regimes examined demonstrate
that, far from converging on a similar paradigm, citizens
and their governments have the space to manoeuvre and
make choices. To avoid unintended negative outcomes in
political and economic terms, the right to social protection has to be realized in a context of reasonable economic
and social stability. And, as demonstrated by the successful
cases, the progressive realization of universal social protection needs to be grounded in a social contract and in
economic conditions that are conducive to this objective.
A policy regime most likely to confront these challenges
in a way that enhances welfare is one that is characterized
by a high degree of institutional complementarities, that
develops synergies between economic and social policies,
and that is based on a social contract grounded in the principles of universalism and solidarity.

Universal Provision
of Social Services
Social services – in areas such as health, education, care,
water and sanitation – can enhance individual well-being,
raise productivity and contribute to overall quality of life.
Such services enable families to care for and sustain their
members and reduce both the costs and time involved in
work and other daily activities. They increase the chances
that individuals and their families can lift themselves out of
poverty and live digniﬁed and productive lives. The kinds,
quantity and quality of services individuals enjoy provide
a good measure of their well-being: indeed, poverty can be
perceived as a failure to achieve certain basic capabilities
arising in part from the absence of social services.1
The instrumental value of services, particularly education
and health care, in promoting growth and alleviating poverty and inequality is now widely acknowledged in policy
circles. Evidence clearly demonstrates the complementarities among different services (health, education, water,
sanitation and nutrition, for example), as well as between
social service provision and other economic policy goals.
Moreover, access to certain social services, speciﬁcally education and health care, is considered a right enshrined in
numerous United Nations declarations. It is a key goal of
rights-based approaches to development and an essential
element in the achievement of most Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
This chapter argues that a universal approach to the provision of social services is essential to realizing their full
potential as a component of transformative social policy.
Achieving broad-based and inclusive coverage can contribute not only to improved well-being, but also to enhanced
productivity and earnings.
In addition, it can reduce inequalities across income, class,
gender, ethnicity and location. The challenge of extending effective provision to populations often marginalized

6

or excluded as a result of these inequalities lies at the
heart of efforts to reduce poverty and reach the MDG
targets. As argued throughout this report, narrowly targeted
interventions may make inroads into particular aspects of
poverty among speciﬁc population groups. However, without
broad-based coverage that aims to redress inequalities and
generate solidarity around development goals, these gains
may not be sustainable.

Narrowly targeted interventions may
make inroads into aspects of poverty
among speciﬁc groups; however these
gains may not be sustainable
Drawing on evidence principally from the health and
education sectors, this chapter highlights the following
key points.
• Integrated systems of social service provision that are
grounded in universal principles can be redistributive,
act as powerful drivers of solidarity and social inclusion,
and improve the capabilities of the poor.
• By contrast, systems that are fragmented – with
multiple providers, programmes and ﬁnancing
mechanisms aimed at different population groups –
have limited potential for redistribution, and generally
result in high costs, poor quality and limited access
for the poor.
• Dominant policy trends since the 1980s, in a context
of crisis, liberalization and public sector retrenchment,
have moved towards the commercialization of social
services, undermining previous progress towards
universal access in many countries, raising out-ofpocket costs, particularly for the poor, and intensifying
inequality and exclusion.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

This chapter draws on the experiences of countries that
have pursued different paths in the provision of social
services at varying levels of income. The evidence shows
that it is possible to institute social service regimes that
lean towards universalism at relatively low income levels.
It demonstrates the importance of substantial public
involvement, whether in direct provision or in the ﬁnancing or effective regulation of services. Public interventions
are essential to ensure that services reach rural and remote
areas, urban slums and marginalized groups, and thus that
their productivity-enhancing and distributional beneﬁts
are obtained.

A number of countries show
that it is possible to institute social
service regimes that lean towards
universalism at relatively low
income levels

Section 1 of the chapter discusses the case for a universal
approach to the provision of social services, how this can
be achieved and the barriers to extension.
Section 2 provides an overview of trends in service provision in developing countries.
Section 3 elaborates on these points with a discussion
of the effects of commercialization on provision and
outcomes.
Section 4 analyses patterns of social service provision
in a select number of countries classiﬁed as leaning
towards universalism, leaning towards universalism in
the context of dualistic economies, and fragmented and
exclusionary systems.
Section 5 draws conclusions that have implications for
policy makers.

1. The Case for Universal and
Public Provision
Social services improve the quality of life by creating,
protecting and sustaining human capabilities. Despite a
lack of consensus in deﬁning the range of basic capabilities, good health, adequate education and nutrition feature
prominently on most lists.2 The centrality of basic services
to improvements in people’s lives has driven various international initiatives, including the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and the MDGs, to promote the goal of
universal coverage. As chapter 5 has shown, universalism
is grounded in the principles of solidarity and citizenship;
it can foster social cohesion and build coalitions across
classes, groups and generations.3 If the poor are provided
with access to the same kinds of services enjoyed by the
rich, universalism may also act as an instrument for redistribution and social mobility.

Universal access to social services promotes
growth and social development
The widely acknowledged instrumental value of education
and health for economic growth and development4 further
underscores the importance of universal provision. This
is particularly true in poor countries where the quality of
human capital necessary for development is limited. An
educated and healthy workforce contributes to economic
growth and poverty reduction through improved skills and
labour productivity, and thus improved incomes and life
chances. The economy as a whole beneﬁts from the expansion of human capital and the acquisition and upgrading
of skills through education.5 Health care likewise contributes to better learning and productivity over the long term;
conversely, poor health or nutrition undermines learning at
school, impairs cognitive development and reduces future
productivity and earnings.
Important complementarities or multiplier effects exist
among different social services.6 Universal access to health
care, for example, enhances investment in education by

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 6 – UNIVERSAL PROVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES

ensuring that school enrolment and outcomes are not constrained by illness. Similarly, universal access to education
enhances investment in health by increasing access to
information about health practices, hygiene, nutrition and
sanitation. The use of reproductive health care facilities,
for example, tends to increase with education.
Health and education provision interact positively with
other social policy interventions, with particular implications for women (see chapter 7). Improved health and
education services may reduce the burden of caring for children and the sick. Early childhood care programmes can
improve child health and education outcomes. Such provisions may reduce the need for social protection or assistance if episodes of illness, and thus loss of employment and
income, are reduced. Social protection mechanisms such as
cash transfers may in turn relax ﬁnancial constraints that
impede access to social services (see chapter 5). Finally,
investments in basic infrastructure such as water, sanitation
and transportation can improve health outcomes, reduce
the time (often of women and children) spent collecting
water or travelling, and facilitate access to other services.

The state plays a critical role in social provision
While the justiﬁcation for universalizing service provision is
clear both on equity and efﬁciency grounds, how, by whom,
and under what circumstances barriers to extension can be
overcome remain critical questions. A variety of actors and
institutions, including states, markets, households, communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
external donors provide or ﬁnance social services. As discussed in section 4 below, the precise mix of actors and
institutions depends on a country’s development strategy
and policy choices, and its historical and institutional legacy. However, the potential beneﬁts of integrated systems
of provision may not be realized when market providers
and other non-state actors are dominant. Given that many
services require signiﬁcant investments in infrastructure,
they will tend to be underprovided by market actors. This
is exacerbated where populations are remote or scattered,
and thus unit costs are high. Active state involvement is

therefore essential – whether in direct provision or ﬁnancing; in coordinating among different providers and services; or in regulating and providing incentives to non-state
service providers to ensure coverage of neglected locations
or population groups, in order to maintain quality and to
ensure affordability.7 Countries that have achieved widespread access to basic social services have done so through
substantial public sector involvement.8 In all such cases,
the belief that the beneﬁts from income growth trickle
down to the poor was rejected. Instead, deliberate actions
were taken to provide social services, recognizing the links
between economic and social policy objectives.

Countries that have achieved
widespread access to basic social
services have done so through
substantial public sector involvement
Achieving universal provision, however, requires overcoming a number of barriers. Structural inequalities based on
individual or collective characteristics (such as gender, disability or ethnicity) may prevent individuals or groups from
accessing or paying for services. As chapter 5 has argued,
some degree of afﬁrmative action or targeted initiatives may
be necessary to resolve this problem. Investments in infrastructure in poor areas (rural and urban) or improvements
in transportation can reduce physical distance and the cost
of access. School feeding and subsidized medicine and transport programmes, along with free textbooks, can increase
attendance at schools or clinics. India’s school enrolment
rate, for example, rose substantially with the introduction
of a mid-day meal programme aimed at increasing enrolment and retention and improving nutrition among primary
school children. Since 2002, the programme has been universal in all government and government-aided schools.
Other barriers include the nature and quality of services. In
education, the content of the curriculum and language of
instruction, teacher-pupil ratios, and the quality of teachers and facilities, for example, affect attendance, learning

As the rest of this chapter shows, the policy trends affecting
mechanisms of delivery and ﬁnancing of social services in
recent decades have generally weakened universalist principles and outcomes. Even where policy objectives are pro-poor
and aimed at broadening coverage and reducing exclusions,
the strategies may still be at odds with the principles of universalism. Beneﬁt incidence analyses, for example, highlight
the skewed distribution of the beneﬁts of public expenditures on education and health towards higher income
groups (see ﬁgures 6.1 and 6.2). The poor beneﬁt relatively
more from investments in primary health and education,
while investments in basic services also demonstrate higher
rates of return. Such ﬁndings have been used to justify the
concentration of public spending in these sectors. However,
without complementary investments in post-primary education or curative care the quality of primary services and the
availability of qualiﬁed personnel declines, or does not keep
up with the expansion in demand. A study in India shows
how a policy prioritizing primary schooling, driven by an
analysis of the rate of return, resulted in the neglect of the
secondary sector, the rise of for-proﬁt schooling at all levels
of education and a fragmented formal primary education
system.12 Similarly, neglect of curative health care has the
greatest impact on the poor who are also susceptible to noninfectious diseases but are unlikely to have access to private
sector treatment. In addition, the separation between the
public and private sectors that results from an orientation
towards public spending on primary services undermines the
redistributive beneﬁts that a uniﬁed system can provide.

outcomes and subsequent employment opportunities. The
school curriculum is often irrelevant to the needs of poor
and marginalized sections of society,9 while gender stereotyping in content often denies girls access to the same subject
choices as boys.10 In multi-ethnic or multi-linguistic environments, the designation of a national language on grounds
of creating ethnic or linguistic unity or shared cultural values
often provokes resistance and places minority groups at an
even greater disadvantage in accessing education.11

During the 1960s and 1970s, public expenditure on
social services grew rapidly in many developing countries,
with social policies treated as integral to development
objectives of creating a modern economy, national identity and social cohesion.13 Looking at the long-term trends,
progress is visible: overall health and education outcomes
have improved considerably over the last 50 years, as
illustrated by increased primary and secondary school
enrolment and a decline in infant mortality across all
regions (see ﬁgures 6.3 and 6.4). The most signiﬁcant
expansion in provision took place prior to the 1980s.
During this period, in Latin America, public schools,
universities and health care networks expanded rapidly
although coverage remained low and, until the 1980s,
was concentrated in urban areas.14 Sub-Saharan Africa
also expanded public provision of education and primary
health care services.15

For many countries, the crises and trends towards market
liberalization from the 1980s led to severe cuts in social
sector spending, with varying effects on social policies and
outcomes. The international ﬁnancial institutions (IFIs),
notably the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), played a major role in determining the nature
of policy change during this period. Stabilization and structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) created substantial
pressure for neoliberal reforms particularly in crisis-hit
countries that were heavily aid dependent or indebted.
In Latin America as a whole, an already moderate share of
public expenditure on social services decreased further after
1982.16 In sub-Saharan Africa, stabilization and adjustment
programmes led to the “utter neglect” of public services,
largely shifting the ﬁnancing burden to consumers through
user fees.17 While experiences within each region varied
signiﬁcantly, in many countries in both sub-Saharan Africa
and Latin America progress in health and education stagnated or reversed during the lost decade.

Growing evidence of the high social costs of adjustment policies18 eventually led to their modiﬁcation, with increased
investment in the neglected social sectors alongside support for country-led development strategies.19 An explicit
focus on poverty reduction returned to the development

165

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

agenda of the IFIs, and was implemented through Poverty
Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), which had at least an
implicit social policy emphasis and paid more attention to
basic services.20 By 2000, for example, the World Bank had
adopted a “no blanket” policy on user fees,21 while under
the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative
countries were expected to use the resources gained from
debt relief for health and education purposes.

With the mobilization of
the international community
around the MDGs in 2000,
the poverty focus of development
assistance has strengthened

With the mobilization of the international community
around the MDGs in 2000, the poverty focus of development assistance has strengthened and, with it, the emphasis
on basic services. The MDGs contain a number of commitments in the areas of health and education and others that
rely on the availability and accessibility of quality services
for their achievement. They have mobilized resources and
efforts around certain goals, and progress – particularly in
basic education and infant mortality – has been signiﬁcant,
at least prior to the global economic crisis.22 Net primary
school enrolment in developing regions reached 89 per cent
in 2008, with major advances in sub-Saharan Africa and
South Asia, the regions that lag farthest behind; gender parity in primary education has been achieved in 60 countries.
In health, deaths of children under ﬁve have declined steadily worldwide, although with slower progress in sub-Saharan
Africa and South Asia. Since 1990, the percentage of births
attended by skilled personnel has improved overall, from
53 per cent in 1990 to 63 per cent in 2008, although in
South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa over half of all births
are still unattended. The least progress was achieved in

166

reducing infant mortality, which only declined marginally.
Increased access to antiretroviral drugs and improved knowledge about preventing the spread of HIV has meant that,
worldwide, the numbers of new HIV infections and AIDS
deaths have peaked; there has also been a dramatic increase
in the use of bed nets to protect people from malaria.
Despite positive trends, major challenges remain and have
been further exacerbated by the global economic crisis.
Underpinning the constraints to further progress in many
cases is the lack of an integrated and universal approach
to social service provision. As the discussion on commercialization below illustrates, approaches to address the
needs of the poor through targeted measures in a context
of inadequate public funding, supply and regulation lead
to fragmented systems where certain groups are likely to
be excluded or receive poor quality services. These exclusions exacerbate existing inequalities, based, for example,
on gender, ethnicity, wealth or disability, and present major
obstacles to universal access.
Public policies designed to reach the poorest and most disadvantaged groups, such as abolishing fees, constructing
facilities in underserved areas and boosting the recruitment
of teachers, can be effective.23 But these need to be part of
a broader approach. Narrowly focusing on primary education and health care in order to meet speciﬁc time-bound
targets risks neglecting investment at the tertiary levels;
the result is a lack of qualiﬁed personnel that, in turn, constrains quality as quantity expands. In South Asia and subSaharan Africa, expanded coverage without commensurate
investment means overcrowded classrooms with untrained
teachers.24 Similarly, overburdened public health facilities
and the poor quality of services may worsen inequality as
higher income groups opt for private services, hiring tutors
or buying the necessary materials or medicines that are
not provided through the public systems. The poor either
lack this option or face severe trade-offs over expenditure
choices.25 Effective delivery of the MDGs thus requires a
holistic, sector-wide and integrated approach to the provision and ﬁnancing of social services.26

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 6 – UNIVERSAL PROVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES

Neoliberal shifts since the 1980s have
produced a trend towards commercialization
One of the most signiﬁcant trends emerging as a consequence of neoliberal policy shifts since the 1980s,
which persists despite increased public investment over
the past decade, has been the commercialization of
social service provision. Driven by inadequate public
funding and pressures to liberalize markets, commercialization processes took various forms (see box 6.1). These
have included direct private-sector involvement in the
ﬁnancing and provision of services, the contracting-out of
social service management to private providers, and the
introduction of cost-recovery measures such as user fees
for public services – thus increasing reliance on private
insurance or out-of-pocket payments.27 These trends compound existing problems of access to reliable and quality
services by the poor, while also contributing to the fragmentation of provision.
Increasing evidence, including research undertaken by
UNRISD,28 points to ways in which commercialization

can undermine effective social service provision. In many
cases, accessibility, affordability and the quality of services –
particularly those available to low-income or marginalized
groups – has fallen, while systems of provision and ﬁnancing have become fragmented among multiple providers.
Often, commercialization has eroded public commitment
to service provision for all, in the interests of private actors
and proﬁt. Public and community systems that charge
fees in conditions of widespread poverty, for example,
tend to lose their public service vocation and become
semi-commercial facilities, changing the incentives and
behaviours of providers. In this process, both the effectiveness and redistributive potential of the system are
constrained. Where commercialization involves a mix of
private services for those who can pay and public provision for the poor, the redistributive mechanisms – rather
than being integral to the system – are separated out and
made visible through the targeting of particular services
to speciﬁc groups. This, in turn, may further fragment and
weaken the system of provision.29 These trends and consequences of privatization are illustrated by experience in the
water sector (see box 6.2).

BOX 6.1: Commercializing health and education services: Four paths
There are four widely observed paths of commercialization in health and education services. First, in predominantly middle-income
countries, the trend is towards privatization of public services or public-private arrangements to promote choice and competition and
therefore improve efﬁciency. This is carried out through the corporatization of hospitals, the introduction of voucher schemes or by
contracting management to private organizations that receive public subsidies. The second trend is towards commercial behaviour
and cost-recovery in public services, for example, through user fees. The third trend, in low-income countries such as those in subSaharan Africa and South Asia, is a growing tendency towards small-scale private and largely unregulated provision. This tends
to occur by default and in response to the underperformance or failure of public provision.a Such services are used of necessity by
the poor and payments are largely out-of-pocket. Finally, commercialization (particularly in the health sector) is also driven by the
globalization in input and labour markets, due to a combination of the operations of multinational companies and trade and industrial
policies. Multinational companies operate in increasingly integrated markets and have played a key role in norm setting on trade
in goods and intellectual property rights. In addition, international agreements, such as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects
of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), introduce product patents, increase the power of transnational ﬁrms and restrict access to
generic drugs in poor countries.b

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

BOX 6.2: Policy challenges in the provision of clean drinking water
The provision of safe drinking water can yield dramatic improvements in health and well-being. When combined with other
interventions, the beneﬁts are multiplied. Water is a basic necessity, and ready access to it can save household members several
hours a day – time that could be used for education or income-generating activities. Yet in spite of these enormous beneﬁts,
1.1 billion people worldwide still lack access to safe sources of water. One result is that 3,900 children die each day from waterrelated diseases.a The MDGs aim to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water.
The world is on track to meet the target, although many countries still face steep challenges. Of people who lack access to clean water,
84 per cent live in rural areas.b

Since the 1990s, private sector participation in the water sector has increased, albeit erratically, in response to rising public sector
deﬁcits and problems of infrastructure maintenance as coverage expanded. A key message of the World Bank’s World Development
Report 1994 was that the private sector should be involved in the management, ﬁnancing and ownership of infrastructure. Reforms
were intended to reduce deﬁcits, improve coverage, increase efﬁciency and reduce political inﬂuence. Consequently, between 1990
and 2005, 55 countries introduced some form of private sector participation in the water sector.

In analysing this trend, research conducted by UNRISDc and others reveals a number of problems, particularly in terms of access and
affordability. The private sector has not necessarily invested more than the public sector, and improved efﬁciency (where it exists)
has not resulted in lower tariffs (as shown in studies from countries including Burkina Faso, Colombia and France). In addition, the
poor have been disproportionately affected by private sector provision, as they tend to have less access to services and to spend a
larger share of their income on water. The pace of privatization has been slow and, since 2002, multinational companies have begun
to withdraw from developing countries. Consequently, the World Bank has recognized the difﬁculty of getting “the private sector to
focus on the alleviation of poverty and to design tariffs in a way that does not discriminate against the poor”.d It has acknowledged
that public funding will continue to be important and shifted its policy stance from reliance on the private sector to encouragement of
public-private partnerships.

The UNRISD research suggests that social policies and public sector investment have been instrumental in ensuring access to the
majority. The policies employed include income support linked to welfare systems; tariff adjustment; a fund for rural supply; and
policies to ensure that households are not disconnected due to non-payment. For example, increasing block tariffs, where water rates
adjust according to usage, are popular in many developing countries. Subsidy schemes to the poorest households are used in many
Latin American countries and even France has provided subsidies to rural areas. The state’s role in mobilizing investments has also
been signiﬁcant. Although initial construction is often largely initiated by the private sector, public investment is necessary to secure
improved supplies, particularly to the poor.

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 6 – UNIVERSAL PROVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES

Consequences for health
The commercialization of health services has been more
prevalent in lower than higher income countries, where
it is clearly associated with worse access and inferior outcomes.30 Overall, public spending on health as a percentage of both total health expenditure and gross domestic
product (GDP) are positively correlated with per capita
income. Socialized medicine, that is, health care that is
free at the point of use and ﬁnanced by general taxation
or social insurance, is more commonly found in wealthier
countries (see ﬁgure 6.5). Conversely, private spending,
as a percentage of total health expenditure, is higher in
low-income countries and among lower income groups.
Low-income populations are most likely to face the most
poverty-inducing form of health ﬁnancing: out-of-pocket
payments (see ﬁgure 6.6). For 5.6 billion people in low- and
middle-income countries, over half of health care spending
is through out-of-pocket payments, and over 100 million
people are pushed into poverty each year because of catastrophic health expenditures.31

Countries with lower levels of commercialization and higher
public expenditures or social insurance demonstrate better
health outcomes. Infant mortality rates tend to be lower and life
expectancy higher in countries with lower ratios of private to
public health expenditure (see ﬁgure 6.7). Similarly, countries
that spend more of their GDP on health through public expenditures or social insurance have signiﬁcantly better health outcomes and better care at birth (as measured by life expectancy,
infant mortality and births attended by skilled personnel).

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Consequences for education
In terms of education, there is greater consensus that the
government has a responsibility to provide all children
with quality education free of charge, at least at the primary
level.36 In most countries, public expenditures continue to
dominate educational provision and ﬁnancing, although
many instances exist of public-private partnerships.
However, user fees and other charges also persist, affecting
the accessibility and affordability of education. The correlation between per capita income and public spending

170

a percentage of GDP and per capita GDP, 2005–2006

Public education expenditure (% GDP)

The motivations behind the introduction of fees and
charges, and thus the push towards commercialization of
services, included cost-recovery, revenue raising, greater
efﬁciency through competition among providers, and
instilling in recipients a greater sense of value for services
obtained. In general there has been a failure to achieve
these aims due to ﬂawed assumptions about how markets
work. Nor have complementary targeted forms of assistance or exemption mechanisms, designed to improve the
access of marginalized groups to services in a context of
commercialized provision, been effective in increasing
coverage due to supply constraints, inadequate resources,
high administrative costs, leakages and stigma (see chapter
5). Overall, in the health sector, the commercialization of
services can thus be viewed as “an afﬂiction of the poor”.35

on education as a percentage of GDP is positive but weak
(see ﬁgure 6.8). However, as in health, commercialization
of education afﬂicts the poor, with a higher share of private
expenditure in countries with lower incomes (see ﬁgure
6.9). The average share of private ﬁnancing in education is
much lower than in health: 18 per cent in education versus
42 per cent in health. In the majority of countries, private
ﬁnancing in education is less than 15 per cent of the total,
and only ﬁve countries (Chile, the Dominican Republic,
Guatemala, the Philippines and the Republic of Korea)
have levels above 40 per cent.37

The proportion of hospital beds and use of ambulatory care
in the public and private sectors in developing countries
suggest that primary care provision (even if nominally public) is highly commercialized, while hospital and in-patient
care is not.32 As a result, the poor are in fact more likely
than the better-off to depend on private (that is, often
informal, small-scale and low quality) providers that charge
modest fees and lack government support and regulation.33
In terms of insurance, however, UNRISD research34 shows
that higher levels of commercialization of primary health
care and private insurers are associated with greater inequality in treatment among income quintiles and greater
exclusion of children from treatment when ill. In almost
all 44 developing countries with data analysed, more than
half of children treated for acute respiratory infection or
diarrhoea were treated privately.

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 6 – UNIVERSAL PROVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES

As in health, commercialization
of education afﬂicts the poor,
with a higher share of private
expenditure in countries with
lower incomes

The provision of private education, measured by the
percentage of the population enrolled in private institutions, displays a large variation among countries, though
it is not related to income level. As an average of primary
and secondary enrolment, almost half of all countries
have a percentage of private enrolment of less than
10 per cent. However, this ﬁgure is over 50 per cent in
13 countries, including Chile, Fiji and Zimbabwe. On
average, private ﬁnancing, as a percentage of GDP,
is slightly higher in secondary than in primary education, and private provision is more extensive in secondary
education.38 Combined gross enrolment is slightly higher
in countries with less private education ﬁnancing and with
higher levels of public spending. However, the relationship
between public spending and student performance is, at
best, weak, since poor learning outcomes and high levels
of inequality are possible at low, medium and high levels of
public spending.39
As in health, mixed public-private provision and ﬁnancing often results in high-cost social service systems that
are socially polarizing. Although mixed approaches can
improve educational quality through choice and competition under certain conditions, they also have the potential
to reinforce inequality. Choice is often constrained by a
lack of purchasing power, limited access to information and,
in many instances, by a lack of provision. Where schools
are able to select students based on ability, disadvantages
arising from characteristics such as income or ethnicity
may be magniﬁed. In Chile, which operates a voucher
programme, student composition differs between public
and private sectors with voucher schools outperforming

public schools.40 In other words, the system channels public resources to private schools that are able to select the
most competent and well-off students. Comparably, in the
health sector, private insurers are able to cherry-pick, insuring only the lowest risks and leaving higher cost patients to
the public sector.
Commercial activity by public education institutions,
such as cost-recovery and user fees, remains prevalent in
many developing countries, driven by underfunding and
poor regulation. Charges may include fees for uniforms,
books, materials, medicines and parental contributions,
as well as compulsory in-kind contributions, including for
school construction and repairs. As in health, such fees
were introduced under erroneous assumptions about the
nature of the market for such services: that cost-recovery
would limit “frivolous use”,41 raise revenues and improve
equity, efﬁciency and quality. Evidence from sub-Saharan
Africa illustrates, on the contrary, that pre-existing barriers
to access resulted in serious underuse of services, with user
fees only adding to these barriers.42
These trends arising from commercialization and underfunding in both the education and health sectors serve
to worsen pre-existing disparities in quality as public services are further overburdened. Trained personnel, who
are attracted by better pay and working conditions, tend
to move from the public to the private sector, thereby reinforcing the trends towards commercialization and further
reducing the quality of public sector provision.

In both health and education,
commercialization and
underfunding worsen pre-existing
disparities in quality as public
services are further overburdened

As argued above, underfunding and commercialization are
serious obstacles to the universalization of social services.
Nonetheless, countries and areas exhibit considerable
variation in their systems of provision. This section highlights three broad approaches based on case studies commissioned for this report. Countries and areas are grouped
in terms of health coverage, educational enrolment, educational quality and the roles of different actors in provision (see ﬁgures 6.10 and 6.11). Along these dimensions,
Costa Rica, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of
China lean strongly towards universalism; Botswana, Brazil
and South Africa are also oriented towards universalism,
but entrenched economic dualism produces what can be
described as fragmented universalism; and Kenya and India
display high levels of fragmentation and exclusion, despite
some commitment towards universalism.

Leaning towards universalism
The Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China and
Costa Rica show signiﬁcant variation in terms of the publicprivate mix in ﬁnancing and providing social services.
However, in all three cases, the state plays a signiﬁcant role
in ensuring universal provision. Notably, social policies are
well supported by other economic policies that reinforce
social investments. These countries and areas progressively
expanded coverage alongside the introduction of complementary policies to ensure that marginalized groups were
able to beneﬁt from a universal approach.
Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China. The
provision of education and health care in the Republic of
Korea and Taiwan Province of China is based on a strong
state regulatory role and bureaucratic capacity, under a
mixed public-private system of ﬁnancing and provision.
Interventions in health and education are enhanced by complementary policies: for example, in the Republic of Korea,
relatively low levels of income inequality have reduced
income constraints among the poor, thereby contributing to equal access to primary and secondary education.

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 6 – UNIVERSAL PROVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES

In addition, the early establishment of sectoral occupational
welfare programmes, such as health insurance and pensions
for personnel in both public and private schools, reduced
the incentive for skilled staff to move to the private sector
and thus maintained quality in public education.
Education has been a particular priority in both these cases,
receiving signiﬁcant public investment as a contribution
to economic growth. In the early stage of industrialization,
investments to improve productivity in labour-intensive
sectors pushed up enrolment and completion rates in both
primary and secondary education; with the shift to higher
value added sectors in the 1970s and 1980s, these gains
were also secured in tertiary education. The high enrolment ratios for the Republic of Korea can be seen in ﬁgure
6.10, with levels well above 90 per cent in primary and secondary education. Primary education is almost exclusively
provided by the public sector (only 1.3 per cent of students are enrolled privately); secondary and tertiary levels
are characterized by a higher share of private provision
(33.5 per cent in secondary education). Since the 1970s,
the Korean government has subsidized private schools.43
Private ﬁnancing is, however, substantial, accounting
for 40 per cent of total expenditures on education.44
The strong quest for education among the country’s
population, along with government subsides, has allowed a
proﬁtable private education business to ﬂourish and tended
to equalize the quality of education in both public and
private institutions. In Taiwan Province of China, public
schools dominate both primary and secondary education.
Although private institutions account for about half of the
total senior high schools and universities, the government’s
tight control on tuition fees has contributed to keeping
education affordable.
The delivery of health care in the Republic of Korea and
Taiwan Province of China is highly commercialized.45 In
2007, the private sector accounted for more than 93 per
cent and 97 per cent of medical facilities in the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China, respectively,46
with hospitals and clinics largely privately owned. Signiﬁcant government involvement and bureaucratic capacity
resulted in the introduction of health insurance schemes

in both places in the late 1980s and early 1990s, coinciding
with democratization and increased concerns with equity.
In the Republic of Korea, health insurance schemes were
established in 1977. Initially they included only formal sector employees, but coverage was progressively expanded.
In 1987, the new democratic government announced its
intention to establish universal national health insurance,
and within two years coverage had increased from less than
51 per cent of the population to over 94 per cent.47 Separate health insurance schemes were integrated and coverage increased, thereby enabling cross-subsidization and
redistribution. However, in spite of universal social health
insurance coverage, out-of-pocket payments remain substantial, accounting for around 50 per cent of total health
expenditures (see chapter 5), with implications for equity.
Similarly, Taiwan Province of China established a universal national health insurance programme in 1995, just a few
years after the democratic government declared its intention to do so.48
Costa Rica. Costa Rica has achieved impressive outcomes
in health and education, particularly primary education.
The state took responsibility for ﬁnancing and delivering social services, achieving increased coverage and a
signiﬁcant distributional impact. This was complemented
by programmes to improve income distribution, including
increasing real wages and providing universal social protection (see chapter 5).

In Costa Rica, the state took
responsibility for ﬁnancing and
delivering social services, and it has
achieved impressive outcomes in
health and education
The process of universalizing education in Costa Rica started
early. Beginning in the 1940s, public education was conceived as an integrated system from preschool to university
with free primary and secondary education. Coverage, especially of secondary education, was progressively expanded

173

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

with particular efforts focused on rural areas and marginalized groups in order to reduce disparities. Economic crisis in
the 1980s halted and even reversed the gains, especially in
rural areas, as public spending on education was cut by 44
per cent between 1980 and 1985.49 Educational quality also
diminished, since wages and investment in infrastructure
were cut and school duration reduced. Subsequently, spending levels were restored and efﬁciency improved, leading to
a revival of coverage gains. Disparities in education among
various income groups persist, however, and are more signiﬁcant than gender disparities or those between rural and
urban areas. A number of policies have been introduced
to address this: a programme targeting urban schools aims
to improve educational quality for low-income families,
and a universal school lunch programme was introduced
to encourage school attendance. Due to limited resources,
geographic targeting of the school lunch programme was
introduced in the 1980s; data on coverage show that it is
successfully reaching poor children.50
In the health sector, the Costa Rican Social Security Fund
(CCSS) was established in 1941 to provide health insurance (with tripartite funding from employees, employers
and the state), initially for employees in urban centres. It
gradually expanded to cover family members, independent
workers and lower income groups. In 1961 the constitution was amended to achieve universal health care within
10 years. The range of services provided by the CCSS and
contribution ceilings were expanded, and private providers
were replaced by services provided directly by the CCSS
through professional staff graduating from the School of
Medicine at the University of Costa Rica, founded in 1960.
Primary health care programmes, such as malaria eradication and rural health care, achieved an impressive level
of coverage, leading to dramatic improvements in health.
By the 1970s, health indicators were similar to those of
developed countries, demonstrating the success of public
health policies and of low-cost, efﬁcient technologies. The
improvements in health indicators were most pronounced
among low-income populations.51
The crisis of the 1980s led to decreased resources, but
halted rather than reversed achievements in health in

174

Costa Rica. The state maintained a dominant role: in 1986,
the private sector accounted for only 2 per cent of hospital beds and 3 per cent of discharges.52 From the 1990s,
the Ministry of Health took on more of a supervisory role,
with delivery increasingly the responsibility of the CCSS.
Increasing labour market informality (though lower than
in other Latin American countries, as discussed in chapter
5) led to decreases in health care coverage. However, the
government introduced voluntary insurance that, in 2006,
became mandatory for the self-employed. Partly as a result
of these policies, the level of health care coverage reached
89 per cent in 2008.53

Fragmented universalism
Countries that exhibit fragmented universalism are typically characterized by a dualist economic structure, with
a large share of the population excluded from the formal
labour market and thus formal social provisions. In states
such as Brazil and South Africa, government policies aimed
at expanding access to social services, particularly in rural
areas, have often been successful in achieving near universal coverage with impressive gains in basic health and
education. However, trends towards commercialization in
the context of high income inequalities and a large informal sector have resulted in polarized service provision
segmented between a high-cost private sector and lower
quality public services. With the policy shift of the 1980s
and 1990s towards privatization, public funding shifted to
targeted subsidies or social assistance to the poor, further
contributing to the underfunding of public facilities.
Brazil. In Brazil, education and health systems have
different historical trajectories. The education system,
which owes its origin to the ﬁrst Republican Constitution
of 1891, is nationally regulated and highly decentralized
in terms of funding and provision. A national education policy of eight years of free basic education became
institutionalized after the revolution of 1930 that centralized state power and propelled the country towards rapid
modernization and industrialization. However, the health
system remained fragmented and unregulated until the
late 1980s, when a national health system was created.
Overall, the democratic constitutional reforms of the 1980s

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 6 – UNIVERSAL PROVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES

pushed the country towards more universal provision of
health and education services.
For much of the post-war period, Brazil’s health sector was
characterized by a dualist structure that largely beneﬁted
formal sector urban employees. The institutional structure
for health provision was segmented, with a limited public
health system, some medical assistance for formal sector
employees, and extensive private provision. Medical assistance coverage was extended to rural workers, domestic
workers and those in the formal sector in the 1970s, paving
the way for a universal health service in the 1980s.
A uniﬁed health system that is highly decentralized was
introduced following democratization in 1985. The universal health policy was driven by a national coalition of
expert activists with roots in social movements. Under the
new system, the public sector can contract private health
care providers for certain services, and individuals and
enterprises can have their own private health insurance
plans.54 The publicly ﬁnanced system pays for public health
services, as well as reimbursing services provided privately
in cases where no public services are available.55 The target
population totals approximately 140 million, with 40 million of those covered by the private sector. A second wave
of reforms in the 1990s sought to improve the ﬁnancial
base and redistributive impact of the public system as well
as strengthen regulation of private provision. Observers
note improvements in health indicators, such as in infant
and maternal health.56 The number of births attended
by skilled personnel is approaching 100 per cent and the
infant mortality rate is fairly low at 20 per 1,000 live births
in 2007 (ﬁgure 6.11). Surveys comparing São Paolo (one of
the richest regions) and the northeast (the poorest) suggest
that although the number of people claiming to have regular health services has improved for all income quintiles in
both São Paolo and the northeast, the two regions are still
very unequal.57
Despite the provision of free public education for the ﬁrst
eight years of schooling before the transition to democracy,
more than 50 per cent of those enrolled in the ﬁrst grade
were obliged to repeat and many dropped out of school after

the second grade. Almost 50 per cent dropped out before
completing all eight grades. Since democratic reforms,
Brazil’s education sector has also expanded coverage. Nearuniversal access to primary education was achieved in the
second half of the 1990s, largely as a result of successful
reforms of primary education funding.58 Tertiary enrolment was promoted by substantial subsidies in the 1980s
(the highest in the world) that largely beneﬁted the rich.
In spite of considerable progress, educational opportunities
were concentrated in industrialized regions of the country,
while the northern and northeastern regions faced a lack
of schools and resources. Education reforms in the last two
decades have focused on reducing inefﬁciencies, resulting
in impressive improvements in public education.59 Net primary enrolment is approaching 100 per cent and net secondary education is nearing 80 per cent (ﬁgure 6.10).

In Brazil, education reforms
over the last two decades have
focused on reducing inefﬁciencies,
resulting in impressive improvements
in public education
Public ﬁnancing for education in Brazil comes from two
sources – general taxation and an education salary fund
raised through contributions by businesses as a percentage
of wages. Educational provision is mostly public at the preschool, primary and secondary levels (accounting for 73 per
cent, 91 per cent and 86 per cent, respectively, of schools),
while higher education is largely private (67 per cent).60
The Fund for the Development of Primary Education and
Teacher Development (FUNDEF) was created in 1996
to reduce large regional inequalities in per student funding by redistributing resources from richer to poorer areas.
Despite considerable improvements, inequalities remain a
challenge. The average number of years spent in school for
25-year-old Brazilians varies signiﬁcantly by income group
– from 4.3 years in the poorest income quintile to 10.3
years for the richest quintile. Inequality becomes more signiﬁcant beyond basic education. The relatively poor region

175

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

of Alagoas had a gross enrolment rate of 95.9 per cent for
the 7–14 year age group, and 76 per cent for the 15–17 year
age group, whereas São Paulo had rates of 98 per cent and
87 per cent, respectively, in 2008.61
The social policy innovations in Brazil have been impressive in both their number and coverage, and include Bolsa
Familia, as well as the National Fund for the Maintenance
and the Development of Basic Education (FUNDEB) and
the Family Health Programme. In particular, the increasing
centrality of conditional cash transfers has received international acclaim. However, research suggests that there is
not much difference in school attendance between beneﬁciaries and non-beneﬁciaries of Bolsa Familia.62 Bolsa
Familia is more successful in improving incomes than in
expanding educational enrolment.
South Africa. In South Africa, the 1994 post-apartheid
state inherited an education system that was characterized by signiﬁcant inequalities in quality and attainment –
the result of the highly unequal allocation of resources.
Education was one of the major concerns of the African
National Congress, and it immediately sought to tackle
inequalities by integrating regionally segregated education
departments into one national system. It also made education compulsory until grade nine and reallocated funding
from formerly white schools to formerly African schools.
The result was an equalization of funding: the share of
funding for African pupils increased from 58 per cent in
1993 to 79 per cent in 1997.
South Africa is characterized by fairly high levels of public
spending on education, with over 5 per cent of the country’s GDP allocated to that sector, ﬁnanced from general
taxation. Net enrolment exceeds 80 per cent at the primary
level and 70 per cent at the secondary level (see ﬁgure 6.10).
Differences in attendance among groups are marginal,
but large inequalities in educational quality and outcomes
persist, leading to the continued correlation between
ethnicity and attainment.
These inequalities can be attributed to a legacy of skewed
resource allocation during the apartheid era, in combination

176

with cost-recovery arrangements, which enable schools
in richer neighbourhoods to charge fees, which are not
regulated, and use the funds to appoint additional teachers
and improve facilities. The government has made efforts
to target the poor, for example through fee-free schools,
which account for 40 per cent of all schools, and the
National Schools Nutrition Programme, which fed
1.6 million primary school children in 2007. However,
such schemes have not been able to resolve imbalances
in the quality of education. Deeply entrenched social and
economic inequalities lock many children from black, poor
and rural households, who attend badly equipped public
schools in poor neighbourhoods, into an underclass in postapartheid South Africa.63

In post-apartheid South Africa,
deeply entrenched social and economic
inequalities lock many children from
black, poor and rural households into

Health care reform in the late 1980s led to a shift from a
regionally and racially segregated system to a public-private
dual system, with access dependent on ability to pay. South
Africa has an impressive public health system. The majority of the population has access to basic health care through
public facilities that charge user fees varying by region. 64
The minority (17 per cent) are covered by high-quality,
expensive, private insurance funded through various medical schemes for mainly formal sector workers. Levels of
immunization and births attended by skilled personnel are
high (see ﬁgure 6.11).
While access to health care is not signiﬁcantly affected
by income, the quality of provision is, with the poor overwhelmingly using underresourced public services, whereas
the rich opt for private ones. Regional inequalities also
exist, since provincial legislatures determine health budgets: public health expenditures per capita have declined in
some regions.65 Despite the fact that the high burden of

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 6 – UNIVERSAL PROVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES

disease in South Africa – particularly of AIDS – requires
more inputs than in countries with a similar income, the
initial neglect of the problem by the government exacerbated the health crisis, leading to severe criticism and
protest from civil society and affected communities. This
policy neglect is now being addressed and important steps
are being taken to combat the disease. In addition, a new
national health insurance programme, funded by general
taxation and a dedicated payroll tax for the formal sector, is
expected to be operational by 2010. It is estimated that the
programme will increase the total health budget by 40 per
cent and address the lack of funds for the public sector.
Botswana. Botswana has achieved impressive outcomes
in health and education. Not surprisingly, the country has
one of the most developed social service systems in Africa,
largely as a result of successful resource mobilization from
mineral rents. The government spends slightly more than
9 per cent of its GDP on education and more than
40 per cent of its total current government spending on
social services. Since independence, the government has
been the main provider of education and health services,
with only limited community or private sector involvement. Botswana has also introduced a social pension, which
directly beneﬁts education, since a strikingly high percentage of household income is spent on schooling expenses.66
However, since the 1980s, there has been a shift towards
privatization and decentralization, with the government
playing the role of facilitating community and private sector efforts to provide social services and the introduction of
cost-recovery measures in health.
In education, substantial government investment and
policies to remove barriers to access have dramatically
improved outcomes. In the 1980s, primary and secondary school fees were abolished, with subsequent improvements in enrolment. Other schemes, such as school feeding
and rural development programmes, were introduced to
improve access by marginalized groups. Consequently,
net primary and secondary enrolment have reached about
80 per cent and 60 per cent, respectively, and literacy is around
80 per cent (see ﬁgure 6.10). However, inequalities based
on geographic location persist, partly as a result of a lack

of trained teachers in rural areas. User fees, which were
reintroduced in 2006, and a growing tendency towards
private education are likely to further disadvantage poorer
groups. Schools where the language of instruction is the
native Tswana tend to be of poor quality compared to
schools with English as the medium of instruction, which
target higher income groups.67

developed social service systems

successful resource mobilization

In the health sector, a state-led and -ﬁnanced policy from
the 1960s succeeded in achieving virtually universal access
to primary health care. The percentage of births attended
by skilled personnel is over 90 per cent, and substantial
improvements have been made in the infant mortality
rate, which stood at around 30 per 1,000 live births in 2007
(see ﬁgure 6.11). A network of health facilities was established and run by the government with signiﬁcant public
investment. The initial emphasis was on creating a clinic
or health post in every village. Consequently, by the mid1980s, more than 85 per cent of the population were within
15 kilometres of a health facility.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the private sector played an increasingly important role in broadening the choice of facilities
and reducing the burden on government services. User fees
were introduced, with exemption mechanisms for lowincome groups. In spite of the shift to increased privatesector participation, the share of private health care in total
health expenditure is only 23 per cent. Thus, health and
education provision in Botswana is less fragmented than
in Brazil and South Africa. Formal sector employees are
able to access higher quality private care, largely in urban
areas, with shorter waiting times than overcrowded government hospitals. The AIDS epidemic poses considerable
challenges in Botswana, and in the 1990s and 2000s has

177

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

resulted in a reversal of previous gains in health. However,
the government provided free treatment to those living
with HIV or AIDS, irrespective of social and economic
status, ethnicity or gender.

Fragmented and exclusionary systems
In a large number of countries, social service provision
is fragmented and exclusionary. This is often the case in
low-income agrarian economies, where a large share of
the population may lack access to public services. Many
of these countries are aid dependent, and consequently
have come under donor pressure to reduce social expenditures and shift the burden to consumers, largely through
cost-recovery measures. Reduced public spending has
tended to diminish availability of services, particularly in
rural areas. Insufﬁcient investment in personnel, infrastructure and materials has led to a decline in quality,
exacerbated as trained staff move to the private sector or
abroad, where working conditions are better. Although
the state remains the main provider, social services have
been increasingly commercialized, with the emergence of
informal, small-scale providers in response to demand from
both rich and poor for better availability or quality of public services.68 A dual system of health and education provision has thus developed, consisting of “an underresourced
and neglected public sector, and a private sector”69 that is
unregulated and may also be of poor quality. Payments for
health care are largely out of pocket and user fees or other
informal charges in education increase barriers to access
and raise inequality.
Kenya. In Kenya, SAPs led to the introduction of costsharing measures and constrained spending on social
services. Real expenditure on basic services as a proportion of government spending fell from 20 per cent in 1980
to 12.4 per cent in 1997.70 As a result, low-income populations tend to have access only to poor services that
they can often ill afford, whether through the public or
private sector.
In the early post-independence period, the Kenyan government aimed to improve both coverage and access through
free health services. Progress was tremendous, with life

178

expectancy rising from 44 years in 1962 to 60 in 1993,
and infant mortality falling by one-third between 1963
and 1987.71 Although public spending was reduced and
user fees introduced between 1989 and 2004, the state has
remained the main funder of the health sector, contributing over 50 per cent. However, the government has commercialized the operation of some of its facilities, which has
led to disparities of access and problems of affordability for
the poor. Trained staff move to the private sector or run
private clinics within, or in parallel to, public facilities,
sometimes siphoning off public resources for private practice.72 Health expenditure has largely been skewed against
poor rural areas: 80 per cent of the population receives only
20 per cent of health expenditures.73 Although subsidized
health programmes have been introduced, even these are
unaffordable for many households.

In a large number of countries,
often low-income agrarian economies,
social service provision is fragmented
and exclusionary
Kenya’s PRSP for 2001–2004 prioritized rural and preventive health to address inequalities. However, in addition
to poor distribution, the health sector still receives insufﬁcient funding to achieve international commitments,
including the MDGs: public health expenditures in 2006
were 2.2 per cent of GDP. This translates into per capita
spending of $6.40 – far short of the World Health Organization (WHO) target of $34.
Kenya places a high premium on education, particularly
higher education. This need was particularly pronounced
in the immediate post-independence years, as the country struggled to ﬁll a large skills gap.74 School enrolment
increased dramatically from 1970: primary gross enrolment
increased from 61.7 per cent to 105.9 per cent in 2006;
similarly, secondary gross enrolment rose from 9 per cent
to 50.3 per cent in this period.75 Gender equality also
improved. Although public spending on education initially

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 6 – UNIVERSAL PROVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES

increased substantially, the SAPs of the 1980s reduced
funding and brought in cost sharing. The government met
the costs of salaries, administration and some ﬁnancing of
infrastructure, while parents were required to pay tuition
fees and textbooks, and communities contributed to school
infrastructure and maintenance.
Many households were unable to meet education costs, and
there was a subsequent decline in primary and secondary
enrolment in the early 1990s, as well as very high drop-out
rates.76 In addition, the quality of education declined and
facilities proved to be inadequate. The target pupil-teacher
ratio of 40:1 is yet to be attained and varies by region, from
35:1 to 70:1. Moreover, less than 50 per cent of pupils
enrolled in primary education complete their schooling,
although the situation has been improving. Government
commitment to full primary education has been a positive development, but there has been no programme for
ensuring continuation into high school, which affects
the poor most severely. Targeted programmes to improve
educational access have been introduced, such as school
feeding programmes that focus on poverty-stricken regions
as well as the provision of textbooks and scholarship
funds. However, these schemes serve less than a quarter of
those in need and the poor often cannot afford even subsidized services.77
India. India’s recent growth acceleration has not translated into substantial improvements in the provision of
basic social services.78 The levels of public expenditure on
health (about 1 per cent of GDP) and education (about 3.5
per cent of GDP) are very low for the country’s per capita
income. Low public funding, preference for higher education and curative medicine over primary education and
public health, and an extensive and largely unregulated
private sector have produced a highly segmented regime of
social service provision.
At independence, the Indian nationalist movement,
through the Bhore Committee report, had committed
itself to building a welfare state that would provide health
services to all citizens irrespective of ability to pay.79
However, private provision, including private practice

by government doctors, was widespread even before
independence and proved difﬁcult to control. Studies
suggest that private sector provision of health is among
the highest in the world.80 The share of private provision
in primary care rose from 74.5 per cent to 78 per cent
in rural areas between 1986/1987 and 2004, and from
73 per cent to 81 per cent in urban areas over the same
period;81 private hospital care rose from 40 per cent to
58 per cent in rural areas and from 40 per cent to
62 per cent in urban areas over the same period. Primary
health care accounts for less than 0.5 per cent of total
public health spending. Out-of-pocket payments account
for over 85 per cent of all health expenditures.
The current health system is unable to deliver standard
services to the vast majority of citizens, and is characterized
by problems of underinvestment, poor maintenance, poor
equipment, low-quality personnel and considerable distance to facilities for much of the population.82 The underﬁve mortality rate (87 per 1,000 live births) and infant
mortality rate (63 per 1,000 live births) are higher than the
world average, and the country’s percentage of underweight
children is also high for its level of per capita income. The
proportion of births that are attended by skilled personnel
is only 47 per cent, and 35.6 per cent of villages have no
health centre within ﬁve kilometres.
A National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) scheme was
launched in 2005 to reduce the rates of infant and maternal
mortality, universalize access to public health services and
promote indigenous systems of medicine by the year 2012.
The NRHM focused on 18 states with weak public health
indicators. Although it is too early to evaluate the impact
of the programme, reports from the ﬁeld and the Ministry
of Health’s own evaluations show that its most important
achievements are the institutionalization of deliveries and
the expansion of immunization coverage. The programme
seems to have had limited impact on other aspects of care,
such as full antenatal care. While institutional deliveries
have gone up substantially in all major states in which the
programme is operating, full antenatal coverage has not
improved in most of them and immunization coverage has
improved in only ﬁve.

179

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

In the ﬁeld of education, universalization of primary
education has been one of the important goals of
India’s development objectives.83 Unlike health, education (especially primary education) is still largely publicly
provided. Eighty-ﬁve per cent of primary schools are managed by central (43 per cent), state and local (42 per cent)
governments. However, the private sector accounts
for 40 per cent of secondary school enrolment. The National
Education Policy Statement of 1968 emphasized free
and compulsory education for all at the primary level,
better status and emoluments for teachers, equalization of
educational opportunities, support for vocational education, and allocation of 6 per cent of GDP to education.
This policy of universalism was reinforced in the New
Education Policy of 1986, which called for a reduction of
inequalities in educational opportunities for women and
disadvantaged castes.
However, improvements in educational indicators have
been less spectacular than shifts in policy. Public expenditure on education steadily rose from 0.5 per cent of
GDP in 1950–1951 to 2 per cent by 1970 and to 3 per cent
to 4 per cent at present, which is still well below the
6 per cent target. Net primary enrolment is reported to
be over 80 per cent, and net secondary enrolment is
around 50 per cent, although studies indicate that national
data may be overestimated and regular attendance levels
may be lower.84 Data for 2005 suggest that 29 per cent of
pupils in grade one through eight drop out of school.85
Health and education expenditures and outcomes vary
considerably across Indian states. States in which governmental power rests on a broad political base and
that have embraced a redistributive agenda tend to
perform well. The state of Kerala, for example, which is
well known for high standards in the social sector, spends
40 per cent of its budget on social services, whereas the
all-India average is 32 per cent. Kerala has a long history of literacy and education movements. In addition,
political and social activism have been employed on
occasion to keep health centres open, and elections have
been won on the basis of a candidate’s support for public
social services.86

4. Providing Universal
Social Services:
Implications for Policy
Comprehensive provision of health care and education
enhance well-being, improve productivity and incomeearning potential, and reduce poverty and inequality.
Underfunding, cuts in social sector expenditures and
commercialization lead to segmentation, inequality and
exclusion in service provision. High-quality private provision for better-off groups may coexist with low-quality
services for the poor, undermining the effectiveness
and redistributive outcomes of an integrated system. In
addition, focusing public spending exclusively on basic
social services can exacerbate inequalities: the resulting
deterioration in secondary and tertiary education may lead
to a decline in the number of trained personnel to staff
schools and hospitals. This concluding section highlights
the importance of publicly ﬁnanced provision and public
regulation of commercialization to achieve universal,
equitable and quality outcomes.

Publicly ﬁnanced systems can be affordable
Lessons from countries leaning towards universalism demonstrate the importance of substantial public involvement
in ensuring that the majority have access to social services.
They also show that public ﬁnancing of social service provision is affordable. Domestic public ﬁnancing instruments
are best suited to minimize exclusion of certain groups from
access, to promote the redistributive role of social service
provision through progressive funding arrangements, and
to strengthen links that promote democracy and social solidarity. However, as chapter 8 will show, external resources,
such as aid and remittances, can complement domestic
public ﬁnancing, especially in low-income countries.
Problems of equity in public spending, highlighted by
beneﬁt-incidence analysis, should be dealt with through
a wider distribution of social services, encompassing
rural and disadvantaged urban areas. In conjunction,

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 6 – UNIVERSAL PROVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES

policies should be introduced to alleviate the structural
constraints that may impede access to universal provision.
Examples of such policies include school meal programmes,
subsidized transport and free medicines, either as targeted
initiatives to complement universal provision or as universally provided schemes. In addition, in the case of health
insurance, initiatives should ensure the coverage of the
informal sector through mandatory, voluntary, free or subsidized programmes.

Lessons from countries leaning
towards universalism demonstrate
the importance of substantial public
involvement in ensuring that the
majority have access to social services

In countries that have achieved high levels of success
in the provision of social services, faith in trickle-down
beneﬁts from income growth was rejected and deliberate
policies were adopted to support comprehensive coverage.
Effective state intervention is required to maximize the
synergies and complementarities among services and their
links to other parts of the political economy, and to promote equity, improve coverage and avoid coordination failure. The synergies within social policy interventions can
be enhanced through comprehensive social protection –
grounded in claimable entitlements – covering the majority of the population, along with effective care policies.
Social service provision should also be embedded in and
support a broader macroeconomic policy, based on productive investment and employment that alleviate inequality
and poverty.
In highly unequal societies that are leaning towards universalism, such as Botswana, Brazil and South Africa, there
have been impressive levels of coverage, especially of basic
health and education. However, the systems tend to be
fragmented and have not eliminated inequalities based on
geographic location or income level. In Brazil and South

Africa, universal provision has largely been achieved due
to social service reforms and commitment to ensuring
accessibility in education and health in recent years, which
should form the basis for further policy reform in the social
sector. Additional efforts should aim to incorporate the
poor into better quality social services by increasing and
improving the distribution of ﬁnancing and by improving
the distribution and quality of social services in rural and
disadvantaged urban areas.
Cost-recovery schemes that result in unequal ﬁnancing of
schools and health services and uneven quality should be
removed. Financing should be balanced out through public expenditures based on tax revenues or social health
insurance. Adequate public funding should minimize private sector involvement, which should also be regulated
to ensure that premiums do not restrict access. In terms
of health, insurance should be extended to hard-to-reach
groups, such as informal and subsistence workers, through
voluntary, mandatory or subsidized insurance schemes,87 as
was successfully done in Costa Rica and the Republic of
Korea. These efforts should be supported by comprehensive
social protection in order to enhance income and access to
social services.
In countries with fragmented and exclusionary systems, such
as India and Kenya, public spending should be increased
and directed to rural and disadvantaged urban areas.
Fees, which create barriers to access, should be removed,
and complementary policies, such as school feeding programmes, should be introduced or expanded to encourage
enrolment and attendance.

Effective commercialization requires regulation
Commercialization of health care and education is both
a market-driven process and one that responds to policy decisions. The experience of the Republic of Korea
demonstrates that, even with high levels of commercialization, access to health and education can be widened.
In the case of health, this has occurred when ﬁnancing
is via social – not individual private – insurance and is

181

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

increasingly extended to the whole population. In the case
of privatized secondary and tertiary education, access has
widened when schools are subsidized and fees are regulated
by the state.

the poor to make claims on the public sector that match the
rights of the socially and privately insured to health care,
and then rebuilding public sector provision to respond to
those claims.

Effective commercialization therefore requires effective
regulation. However, commercialized health and education
systems in developing countries are largely unregulated,
and formal regulation is not only hard to achieve in liberalized markets, but also costly, as experiences in developed countries show. A more effective policy framework
would focus on deﬁning and enforcing the form and limits
of commercialization appropriate to health and education
objectives at different levels of development and in diverse
political contexts. Key policy tools for this purpose include
national ﬁnancing mechanisms that promote solidarity,
along with public provision. Rebuilding public sector provision reshapes the market and competitive framework for
the private sector. It also means establishing the rights of

In the past, macroeconomic policies focused primarily on
containing public debt and inﬂation, liberalizing markets,
privatizing state assets and liberalizing external trade and
capital ﬂows. Protecting livelihoods, incomes and social
services was not a priority. Instead, poverty reduction was
perceived as an outcome of growth, which was expected
to occur following stabilization and liberalization. Yet as
described in various chapters of this report, growth performance and poverty reduction in many countries have
been unsatisfactory. While progress has been made in meeting the MDGs in the areas of health and education, more
remains to be done to tackle inequalities in provision,
transcend the focus on primary health and education, and
improve quality.

CHAPTER

Care and Well-Being
in a Development Context
As previous chapters in Section two of the report have
shown, conditions of poverty and well-being are affected
not only by incomes and wages, but also by social services
and social protection. This chapter argues that another
important – but often invisible – contribution to livelihood and well-being is the unpaid care work that goes into
sustaining families, households and societies on a daily and
generational basis. This constitutes a central part of social
reproduction, which is a key element of transformative
social policy (see overview).
Unpaid care work includes housework (meal preparation
and cleaning) and care of persons (bathing a child or watching over a frail elderly person, for example) carried out in
homes and communities. Such work contributes to wellbeing and fuels economic growth through the reproduction of a labour force that is ﬁt, productive and capable of
learning and creativity. Women perform the bulk of unpaid
care work across all economies and cultures. It is estimated
that if such work were assigned a monetary value, it would
constitute between 10 and 39 per cent of a country’s gross
domestic product (GDP).1

If unpaid care work were assigned
a monetary value, it would constitute
between 10 and 39 per cent of a
country’s GDP
Despite its considerable economic value, unpaid care work
is not included in labour force surveys. Nor is it brought
into the calculation of a country’s GDP. It is therefore
not reﬂected in economic indicators that inform policy
making. Similarly, despite its importance in meeting many
of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (such as

7

reducing child and maternal mortality, achieving universal
primary education and combating HIV/AIDS), unpaid care
work is not explicitly mentioned in the MDGs.
Paid care services, such as childcare, elder care, nursing and
teaching, also constitute a growing part of the economy and
of employment in many countries. In the United States, for
example, professional and domestic care services have grown
from employing 13.3 per cent of the workforce in 1900 to
22.6 per cent in 1998 (representing almost as many workers
as are in the manufacturing sector).2 In India, the number of
domestic workers has increased signiﬁcantly over the last decade of economic liberalization. When care work is decently
paid and protected, it can meet the interests of both workers
and the users of those services. But this is rarely the case.
Why should development policy be concerned about care?
Some would emphasize its importance to economic growth,
whether in terms of its contribution to human capital formation or as a component of social investment. Others see
care more broadly, as part of the social fabric and integral to
social development. How societies address care also has farreaching implications for gender relations and inequality.
The need to address care through public policy is now
more urgent than ever. Women’s massive entry into the
paid workforce – a near-global trend – has squeezed the
time available for unpaid care of family and friends. Ageing populations in some countries, and major health crises
(especially HIV and AIDS) in others, have intensiﬁed the
need for care services. Meanwhile, as public provisioning
of infrastructure and welfare services falls short of need and
demand, especially in times of crisis, care responsibilities
are shifted back onto families, with women and girls often
acting as the ultimate safety net.3 There are, however, serious limits to how far burdens can be unloaded onto the
unpaid care economy without damaging human capabilities

185

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

and weakening the social fabric. In recent years, perhaps in
recognition of these risks, care has begun to be seen, at least
in part, as a public responsibility.

Asian developmental states; middle-income countries in Latin
America and sub-Saharan Africa; and lower income agrarian
economies where the policy challenges are most severe.

This chapter challenges the view that only more developed
countries can afford specialized care provision by the state
and market, and that poorer countries, by necessity, must
rely on unpaid family and community solutions. In fact,
many developing country governments are experimenting
with new ways of responding to care needs in their societies. The variations across countries in how social and care
policies are taking shape hold important policy lessons.

Section 4 sets out key principles that need to inform policy
and policy priorities for developing countries.

The evidence provided in this chapter points to four main
conclusions.
• Unpaid caregiving is the bedrock of social provisioning
and underpins economic growth and social development.
However, it is largely invisible and undervalued.
• Women carry out the bulk of care work.
• Policies that are good for care are not a luxury that only
rich countries can afford.
• Explicit care policies may be inadequate in many
developing countries. But policies in other areas, which
affect access to income, infrastructure and technology,
and social services, can be important sources of support
for unpaid caregivers.
Section 1 of this chapter sets out the key concepts and framework for the analysis of care and policy responses to it.
Section 2 focuses on one signiﬁcant component of care
provisioning: the extensive scope of unpaid care work carried out in families, households and communities in both
advanced industrialized and developing countries. It also
looks at the gender characteristics of such care, using data
available through time use surveys.
Section 3 explores the institutional conﬁgurations, policies and inputs that affect caregiving in a range of countries. The section takes a brief look at the commonalities
and differences in care policy in advanced industrialized
countries. It then focuses on three other clusters of countries
or areas that have not been as extensively researched: East

1. Care in Context:
Institutional Arrangements
and Enabling Policies
Diverse institutions have a hand in caregiving
Four main institutions are involved in the design, funding and delivery of care: households and families; markets;
the state; and the not-for-proﬁt sector. These institutions
can be represented as a care diamond (ﬁgure 7.1).4 In addition, evidence from many low- and lower-middle-income
countries, outlined in section 3, suggests that multilateral,
bilateral and non-governmental international organizations also fund and shape many care-related policies and
programmes in aid-dependent countries.5

Not-for-proﬁt sector
These institutions interact in complex ways, and the
boundaries between them are neither clear-cut nor static.

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 7 – CARE AND WELL-BEING IN A DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

For example, the state often funds care services that are
delivered through non-proﬁt organizations.6 Furthermore,
the role of the state is qualitatively different from that of
other institutions of the care diamond, because it is not just
a provider of public care services, but also a signiﬁcant decision maker when it comes to the rights and responsibilities
of the other institutions. Whether and how the state makes
use of its role is fundamental in deﬁning who has access to
quality care and who bears the costs of its provision. The
effective creation, regulation and funding of care services
can increase the access, affordability and quality of care and
reduce time burdens placed on unpaid caregivers. Similarly,
parental leave or family/child allowances can be ﬁnanced
through taxes or social insurance programmes, thereby
socializing some of the costs assumed by unpaid caregivers.
When the state lacks the capacity (or political will) to adequately provide, fund and regulate care, families and households inevitably take on a greater share of its provision.
Excessive reliance on the unpaid work of family members is
not limited to developing countries. In countries as diverse
as Italy, Japan, Spain and Switzerland, most families are left
to make their own arrangements for care provision, sometimes by hiring informally employed migrant workers.7
Care diamonds also vary across income groups. Highincome households, for example, are often in a better position to choose among different options (such as public or
fee-based private services or hiring of domestic workers),
while low-income households have more limited choices
(for example, public childcare facilities with long waiting
lists or unpaid care by family members).

An enabling environment can ease
the burden of care
Good care requires a variety of resources, including time
and material resources.8 Time is a key input into care in
both developing and developed country contexts (see section 3 below). However, the question of time cannot be
considered without the material dimension. It is one thing
to be time-poor and income-rich (middle-class profession-

als), another to be time-poor and income-poor (women
wage labourers in rural India), and quite another still to
be time-rich and income-poor by being forced into idleness because of very high rates of structural unemployment
(as in South Africa). There are, therefore, three preconditions for caregiving, including the availability of:
• paid work (or, in its absence, social transfers) to ensure
sufﬁcient income with which to purchase the necessary
inputs into direct caregiving (such as nutritious food or
transportation to reach the nearest health centre);
• appropriate infrastructure and technology (including
water and sanitation and time-saving domestic
technology), to increase the efﬁciency and lessen the
burden of unpaid domestic work; and
• enabling social services (such as health care and
primary education) to complement unpaid caregiving.
None of these preconditions can be taken for granted in
developing countries.9 In addition to this broader enabling
environment, ensuring adequate care also requires speciﬁc
policies that have a direct bearing on care provision.

Speciﬁc care policies can also lighten the load
Speciﬁc care-related policies can be broadly categorized into
three areas: time-related measures (such as parental leave),
ﬁnancial resources (such as child and family allowances or
pension credits) and services (childcare services, for example).
Such policies cannot substitute each other, however. They are
complementary, ensuring that the rights and needs of caregivers and care recipients are met in an appropriate way.
Paid care leave (such as parental leave) provides caregivers
with time and resources with which to care for dependants.
However, paid leave is rarely offered to workers who are informally employed. Paid leave can also reinforce the notion of
caregiving as women’s work if it is restricted to female workers.
Cash transfers can assist families with the cost of bringing up children. However, when transfers are targeted to
mothers and made conditional (on children undergoing
regular health checks, for example, or mothers attending

187

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

workshops on nutrition), they can add to the already heavy
workloads of poor women and lack any incentive for sharing work between women and men.
Accessible and affordable care services can give unpaid caregivers the option of engaging in other activities, including
income earning, while ensuring a level of care and safety for
their dependants. If done properly, investment in preschool
and childcare services can generate new employment opportunities, free up women’s time for participation in the paid economy and yield future returns in terms of child development.

on all activities carried out over a speciﬁed period, including the time spent on:
• non-productive activities: sleep, leisure, study and self-care;
• employment-related work, which in developing
countries includes both market work and subsistence
activities, such as subsistence agriculture and gathering
fuel and water (also called SNA work); and
• unpaid care work (also called extended–SNA),
which includes unpaid housework and person-care.11

What happens to caregiving and well-being in the process
of development? Does capital accumulation – a necessity
for developing countries – facilitate caregiving and enhance
human well-being? Or does it come at their expense? As
this report explains, the process of structural change often
entails an increase in agricultural productivity and diversiﬁcation of the productive base through manufacturing,
typically by increasing the output of items produced for pay
by women (see chapter 4). There is a good deal of evidence
to suggest that growth and poverty reduction strategies
that rely on increases in women’s paid work are not always
matched by a reduction in their unpaid care work. In such
situations, the result is often an extension of the total time
spent by women on paid and unpaid work, as well as a
reduction in the quality of the output produced by unpaid
work, especially through a squeeze on time for care.10

To highlight the signiﬁcance of unpaid care work in terms
of the amount of time that is allocated to it, ﬁgure 7.2

selected high-income country clusters.12

How much care families and households provide can be
quantiﬁed using the metric of time. The main sources of
data are time use surveys. These differ from standard labour
force surveys in that they typically ask respondents to report

provide it in the form of ﬁnancial obligations, lost opportunities and foregone earnings – which is not to deny that it
also generates intrinsic rewards, stronger family and social
ties, and good quality services for dependants.17 The costs,
however, are unequally borne. Women in general tend to
bear a disproportionate share of the work, while many of the
beneﬁts go to society more broadly, as children grow up and
join the workforce and pay taxes. The cost is also unequally
borne across social classes, given the generally higher rates
of fertility among lower income households.

Extended SNA work

Notes: The SNA distinguishes production that is included in calculations of GDP
and that which is not. SNA work includes the production of all goods (whether
or not they are sold on the market) and services that are sold on the market.
Extended SNA – or unpaid care work – refers to work that is excluded from the
calculation of GDP, such as housework in one’s own home and unpaid care for
children, the elderly, and people who are ill or disabled. In contrast to the mean
actor time, the calculations for the full sample population include those who
spend no time on caring. Source: Budlender 2008a.

It should not come as a surprise that, in all countries, women’s
hours of paid work (or SNA work) are fewer than men’s, while
men contribute less time to unpaid care work. Among the
six countries in ﬁgure 7.3, the mean time spent by women on
unpaid care work is more than twice the mean time spent by
men. The gender gap is most marked in India, where women
spend nearly 10 times as much time on unpaid care work as men.
Men in India and the Republic of Korea tend to do noticeably
less unpaid care work than men in the other countries.

It is evident from these two ﬁgures that, despite the wellknown difﬁculties of capturing unpaid care work through time
use surveys,15 the volume of such work provided by women
and men is signiﬁcant. Also remarkable is the large quantity
of unpaid care work in high-income countries. While nonmarket work remains important within the advanced economies, its composition seems to shift in the course of economic
development, with a decline in the relative share of time
devoted to housework and an increase in the relative share of
time devoted to the care of children and other dependants.16

If paid and unpaid work are combined, women in all six countries allocate more time to work than men – which means less
time for leisure, education, political participation and self-care.
A similar pattern is found among most high-income countries
(with the exception of the Nordic cluster), as shown in ﬁgure
7.2. In general, therefore, it is fair to say that time poverty is
more prevalent among women than men. But this statement
relates to averages (or means) calculated across the population. In fact, the distribution patterns for men and women are
very different, with low variability among men (that is, men
do a consistently low amount of unpaid care work) and high
variability among women (some women do signiﬁcantly more
unpaid care work than others). As a consequence, there is a
notable level of intra-group inequality.18

Women spend more time on paid and
unpaid care combined than men

Several factors affect the amount of unpaid
care work performed by both sexes

To say that a large part of care work in all societies is provided
on an unpaid basis does not mean that unpaid care carries
no costs. In fact, it imposes substantial costs on those who

Age, gender, marital status, income/class, ethnicity/caste
and the presence of young children in the household are
some of the factors that inﬂuence the time people spend

189

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

on unpaid care work. These factors can also reinforce each
other. A simple tabulation by age, for example, would show
a clear pattern of increased engagement in, and time spent
on, care of persons as age increases, up to a point. Part of
this pattern can be explained by the fact that adults are
more likely to be married and to have children. Both of
these factors in and of themselves tend to result in an
increase in time spent on care of persons.

BOX 7.1: Measuring the burden of care:
The care dependency ratio
The care dependency ratio is intended to reﬂect the relative
burden placed on cargivers in a society. As with the standard
dependency ratio, the care dependency ratio is deﬁned
in terms of age groups. Those with intense care needs
(0–6 years of age and 85+ years) are given full weight, while
those with less intense needs (7–12 years and 75–84 years)

Looking at unpaid care work more broadly, cross-country
data show that being male tends to result in doing less of this
type of work. As far as the age of the caregiver is concerned,
the common pattern is an initial increase in the amount of
unpaid care work performed, followed by a decrease. Meanwhile, household income tends to have an inverse relationship to women’s time spent on unpaid care work. In other
words, in low-income households, women allocate more
time to such tasks than in high-income households, possibly reﬂecting limited options for purchasing care services,
the lack of infrastructure and larger household size.19

get half-weights. Potential caregivers fall in the age category

Having a young child in the household has a major impact
on the amount of unpaid care work assumed by women and
men. At ﬁrst glance, this would suggest that falling fertility rates could yield a care dividend in the form of reduced
unpaid care burdens. In reality, however, demographic variables alone (for example, a simple ratio of young children
to adults) do not determine care needs and burdens. Rather,
they are ﬁltered through social, cultural and economic factors that, in turn, shape what is considered to be sufﬁcient
or good care.

The care dependency ratio tends to undercount the number

190

Those needing care:
A=0–6 years; weight: 1

B=7–12 years; weight: 0.5

C=75–84 years; weight: 0.5

E=15–74 years

Care dependency ratio = (A+B+C+D)/E

of people needing care (and overestimate the number of
caregivers), since it does not take into consideration those in
either group who are disabled or ill (due to lack of adequate
data). Undercounting is most likely to occur in countries
affected by HIV and AIDS. The care dependency ratio also
disregards the fact that all people require a certain amount
of care.

This point is illustrated by the ﬁgure in box 7.1, which shows
that the care dependency ratio is lowest in the Republic of

of the under-six cohort. Demographic structures thus suggest
a lower care burden in the Republic of Korea and Argentina
than in the United Republic of Tanzania, India and South

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 7 – CARE AND WELL-BEING IN A DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

3. Care Arrangements across
Countries
This section explains how care needs are being addressed
through public policy in a range of countries – from the
institutionalized welfare states, where the issue of care is
an established element of the policy agenda, to East Asian
developmental states and middle-income countries. Finally,
it looks at agrarian and lower income developing countries,
where the policy challenges of care are most severe.
From the analysis it becomes clear that despite relatively
similar levels of income within each cluster, there is considerable variation in how care needs are being addressed. The
comparative ﬁndings hold important policy lessons, which
are summarized in section 4.

How care policies affect outcomes
Lessons from advanced industrialized economies
Most high-income countries have gradually moved away
from the male-breadwinner model (see chapter 4). Women’s labour force participation has been growing in most
countries, reducing the time spent on unpaid care work at
home. As a consequence, recognition of care as a public
policy issue is also on the rise. Institutionalized welfare
states have responded differently to this scenario.

Recognition of care as a public
policy issue is on the rise in most
high-income countries, largely as
a result of women’s increased
labour force participation

Policy interventions in these countries have ranged from
allowances for caregivers or care recipients, to tax breaks,
paid and unpaid leave provision, social security credits and
social services. Some assist caregivers in carrying out their
tasks; others partly substitute for their labour. Yet others
allow care recipients (including those with disabilities)
to buy-in the assistance they consider necessary. Crosscountry comparative research provides critical assessments
of these policies based on a number of criteria, including
gender equality, women’s access to paid employment and
the rights of caregivers and care recipients.20
Table 7.1 shows a trend across Europe that favours multidimensional responses to care and thus some degree of convergence. However, it also reveals that, across high-income
countries, overall spending on family policy varies (indicating different levels of state commitment to care) and that
policy emphasis is not uniform. Some states, including the
Nordic countries and France, have placed the accent on
the provision of care services. In addition to services and
transfers, the Nordic countries also provide generous leave
systems and comparatively long and well-compensated
paternity leave or father quotas in parental leave. They
have therefore been characterized as “caring states” that
provide families with multiple options.
Other states are more active in supporting family care
through cash beneﬁts, particularly the United Kingdom
and Ireland, rather than offering services. Germany and the
United States spend more on tax breaks towards families
than they do on service provision, which favours higher
income households. Canada, the United States and the
Southern European countries, which are particularly low
spenders, have therefore been called “non-caring states”.21

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 7 – CARE AND WELL-BEING IN A DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

The combination of employment opportunities and state
social provisioning has consequences for the poverty risk
of single mothers who have to juggle income-earning and
care responsibilities (see chapter 4). While the relationship
between public spending on families and poverty outcomes

is not straightforward, concern is growing about child poverty in several high-income countries of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),
and rightly so, as table 7.2 suggests.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Anglophone and Southern European countries, and Germany, show the highest child poverty rates. Moreover, poverty tends to be higher among children than among the
total population in these countries. The four Nordic countries in the sample outperform all others in terms of reducing
child poverty, mirroring the ﬁndings on low poverty rates
among single mothers in those countries (see chapter 4).
Child poverty levels are actually lower than overall poverty
in the Nordic countries. This suggests that high performers in terms of child welfare (that is, countries where child
poverty rates are very low both absolutely and relative to
overall poverty rates) tend to be high spenders with a balanced mix of public spending on services, parental leave
and transfers. However not all high spenders perform well
(such as Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom).

High performers in terms of child
welfare tend to have a balanced mix of
public spending on services, parental
leave and transfers
Time, money and services are thus complementary rather
than alternative policy inputs. Cash transfers can assist
families ﬁnancially with the cost of bringing up children,
but transfer-heavy and service-lean systems also tend to
undermine women’s participation in paid work. Tax cuts,
on the other hand, display a clear class bias, failing to reach
households whose income is below the tax threshold. The
provision of accessible and affordable care services, on the
other hand, can give unpaid caregivers the option of engaging in other activities, including paid work, thus improving
the income level of their households.

Catching up: Care and developmentalism
in two Asian Tigers
The export-led industrialization period for Taiwan Province of China and the Republic of Korea relied heavily
on the use of female labour in the manufacturing sector
(see chapter 4). Since the 1980s, both have followed a
similar decline in total fertility rates and, hence, are

194

experiencing population ageing. Concern over demographic change and possible labour shortages has led to
greater attention to women’s care responsibilities. However, government response and the institutional set-up for
childcare and family welfare appear to be quite different.
Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea – where caregiving has been largely left to families – has been undergoing important changes over the last two decades. Both
political contestation and demographic imperatives have
catapulted social care onto the national policy agenda. The
state has extended and redesigned parental leave, expanded
early childhood education and early childhood care, and
integrated the two systems. It has also provided subsidies to
childcare centres and tax exemptions for families. In 2008,
the Elderly Care Insurance programme was introduced to
cover long-term care needs.
Despite the increase in social spending since 1990, the
proportion that goes to the family remained a marginal
0.39 per cent of total government expenditure in 2003.22
Most of this spending has focused on service provision. While
the Republic of Korea was lagging behind most member
countries of the OECD in coverage of children under age 3,
the country has been proactive in its efforts to catch up. For
example, from 2004 to 2006, under-3 coverage increased from
19 per cent to 31 per cent, outperforming 20 of 36 OECD
countries.23 Most enrolment is part-time, reﬂecting the country’s female employment patterns (see chapter 4).
The state partially ﬁnances and regulates the provision
of care, but does not actually deliver most care services.
Indeed, only around 6 per cent of the childcare centres are
truly public; the rest are subsidized private-for-proﬁt and
non-proﬁt centres, mimicking the role of the private sector
in the delivery of health care (see chapter 6). Government
subsidies, on a sliding scale based on parents’ income, are
paid directly to the institution where the child is enrolled.
Hence, the same institution may be frequented by children
from low- and high-income groups, with the participation of those from lower income families subsidized by the
state. A distinguishing feature of public childcare centres
is that they are run as part of the public service; their staff

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 7 – CARE AND WELL-BEING IN A DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

members, often with strong educational qualiﬁcations, are
classiﬁed as public servants, enjoy good working conditions
and salaries, and are represented by public sector unions.
This is not the case with workers in the subsidized sectors,
both for-proﬁt and non-proﬁt, who tend to have fewer
qualiﬁcations and lower salaries.
Even though the country’s Ministry of Gender Equality
and Family, and policy think tanks linked to it, had proposed the Nordic path of direct public care provisioning,
opposition from the Ministry of Planning and Budget as
well as the Private Childcare Providers’ Association ﬁnally
led to the adoption of a less state-centred delivery mechanism. Childcare subsidies have been presented not only as
a family-friendly social policy, but also as a family-friendly
economic policy, framing social services as the growth
engines of the new economy. In a similar vein, the Elderly
Care Insurance services are expected to be provided primarily by the market and non-proﬁt sector. The expansion
of social care in the Republic of Korea is therefore hardly
market challenging.24

Social services have been framed
as the growth engines of the new
economy in the Republic of Korea
In addition to services, the government has introduced
a number of policy reforms to harmonize work and family life. For example, the 2001 Maternity Protection Act
extended paid maternity leave from 60 to 90 days (at 100
per cent wage replacement) and introduced ﬁnancial support for parents taking one-year parental leave. In response
to high non-compliance rates by employers, maternity leave
legislation was revised again in 2005, shifting the ﬁnancial burden of wage replacement from the employer to the
state and social insurance. To encourage uptake of parental
leave, a monthly ﬂat-rate wage of approximately $250 per
month was added to the remaining nine months of leave in
2004. This rate was subsequently raised, reaching $500 in
2007. A non-transferable “daddy quota” in parental leave
was also introduced in 2006.25 However, the total take-up

rate of parental leave is still very low: 5 per cent of eligible
mothers and less than 1 per cent of eligible fathers. Surveys
show that the main reason for the low take-up rate is workplace discrimination against workers who take the leave.
Taiwan Province of China. In Taiwan Province of China,
state activity in social care appears to be lower than in the
Republic of Korea. The maximum length of paid maternity leave, for example, is 56 days compared to 90 days in
the Republic of Korea. State provision of childcare services also appears to be limited, as in the Republic of Korea,
and private and for-proﬁt childcare organizations outnumber publicly provided services there.26 The relaxation of
immigration laws for foreign caregivers suggests another
method of privatizing care responsibilities by shifting the
care burden away from the state and down a gendered, and
ethnicized, global care chain.27 The Taiwanese government
opened up immigration laws in 1992 to allow the inﬂow
of foreign domestic workers to solve the care deﬁcit.28 In
2003, there were around 120,000 documented migrant
domestic workers in the country – most of them from Indonesia and Viet Nam and, to a lesser extent, from the Philippines – with their presence making up for “the absence of
the state and the husband”.29 In the Republic of Korea, in
contrast, the immigration of foreign domestic workers has
so far been minimal, due to its more conservative stance on
labour migration.

The challenge of inequality:
Care in dualist economies
Argentina, Chile, Mexico, South Africa and Uruguay.
While primary school enrolment is close to universal
in most upper-middle-income countries, many of them,
including Argentina, Chile, Mexico, South Africa30 and
Uruguay have been experimenting with a range of carerelated social policies. These include early childhood
education and care, full-day school programmes, pension
credits for child-rearing, conditional and unconditional
cash transfers and home-based care of the sick, to name just
a few. All of these countries are characterized by fairly segmented labour markets and high levels of income inequality. These inequalities are often reproduced in the type of
care services accessible to children.

195

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Dualist labour markets leave large parts of the working population excluded from employment-related beneﬁts, such as
paid maternity or parental leave. In Argentina, for example, the law that stipulates a three-month maternity leave
at 100 per cent wage replacement applies only to half the
female workforce due to pervasive informality.31 In none of
the above countries can fathers signiﬁcantly share parental
leave. A similar spillover from labour market inequalities
to care entitlements can be observed when childcare service provision is through social security, excluding informal
workers from this beneﬁt, as is the case in Mexico. Where
access to childcare has been introduced as a right of working
mothers and provision is left to employers, as in Argentina
or Chile, weak enforcement often leads to low compliance
and coverage. There is thus a dire need for accessible care
services that are not linked to employment, particularly in
the face of increasing labour market informality.
Some of these countries have made progress in early childhood education and care services for children aged 3 to
5. Figure 7.4 shows, however, that enrolment levels vary
considerably – as does private sector participation. Thus,
Uruguay outperforms Chile at lower levels of per capita
income, and all of the Latin American countries in ﬁgure
7.4 do better than South Africa.

In Argentina and Mexico, preschool coverage increased
signiﬁcantly after attendance was made mandatory for different age groups. In Mexico, preschool enrolment for children aged 3 to 5 was made compulsory in 2002 and, since
that time, has grown from 3.5 million to almost 5 million
children. Almost universal coverage of 4- and 5-year-olds
was achieved in 2008. While coverage of 3-year-olds had
doubled, it remained at a low 34 per cent.32 Most preschools
are public and run only half-day programmes, limiting the
extent to which they can address working parents’ needs
for childcare. A recent evaluation also shows huge differences in quality and student achievement across public preschools in rural and urban areas, as well as the few private
schools performing considerably better.33
In Argentina, preschool attendance was made mandatory for 5-year-olds and coverage is now close to universal.
Nevertheless, coverage and quality of preschool education
are still characterized by regional disparities (particularly
with regard to the availability of full-day programmes).
Furthermore, for 3- and 4-year-olds, access to quality preschools is limited for children from families who cannot pay
for the service, as ﬁgure 7.5 shows. The gap between different income groups shrinks signiﬁcantly in the age group for
which attendance was made compulsory (age 5), indicating that this measure has had a positive effect on reducing
inequalities in access to early childhood education.34

Chile, where preschool education is not mandatory and
private sector participation is much more pronounced,
displays similar inequalities. According to a 2006 household survey, 70 per cent of 4- and 5-year-old children from
the poorest income quintile attended preschool in 2006,
compared to 87 per cent from the richest quintile.35 There
is also clear segmentation along the lines of household
income with respect to the type of institution children
attend. Half the children from the richest quintile enrolled
in private institutions, while coverage in the poorest quintile is largely concentrated in public institutions.
For younger age groups (0–3 years), the picture is less
encouraging in most countries. In Uruguay, where overall enrolment rates are high by Latin American standards,
approximately 75 per cent of the 3-year-old children from
poor households are without access.36 In Chile, coverage
was low and negligible for children under the age of 2 until
2006, when the government launched a programme to
expand the availability of public daycare facilities. Similarly, public childcare for lower age groups is still scarce in
Argentina, and the market plays a dominant role in its provision – an arrangement that is also heavily class-biased.37
Child-centred cash transfer schemes. In advanced industrialized countries, child allowances were never intended
to pay for care. The idea, rather, was to assist families with
some of the material costs of raising children. In developing
countries, a new generation of cash transfer programmes
is often framed as a measure for reducing poverty and
enhancing children’s capabilities. While these transfers are
thus not meant to pay for care, many of them are explicitly
targeted to mothers or primary caregivers and facilitate the
care work they do by allowing them to purchase essential
inputs (food, school supplies, health services) or to buy-in
care substitutes (by drawing on family members or informal
carers). Social assistance pensions or disability grants, on
the other hand, can help elderly people and those with disabilities to care for themselves by purchasing care where
necessary. The disability movement in particular has tended
to take a more positive attitude towards the availability of
cash beneﬁts (as opposed to service provisioning). It has
argued that cash beneﬁts enable people with disabilities

to exercise greater choice in accessing the type of services
they need and hence foster greater independent living.38
In several Latin American countries, child-centred cash
transfer schemes tend to be conditioned on compliance
with care requirements, such as taking children for regular
health checks, ensuring school attendance and participating in health and nutritional workshops. The two largest
long-standing programmes in this area – Mexico’s Progresa/
Oportunidades and Brazil’s Bolsa Familia – have served as
blueprints and, by 2008, at least 10 Latin American countries had initiated similar schemes. Progresa/Oportunidades
and Bolsa Familia now reach signiﬁcant proportions of the
population (see table 5.5 in chapter 5). In most countries,
transfers are targeted to the poor and beneﬁts are channelled through women, usually mothers, who are in charge
of fulﬁlling the conditionalities.
Despite their limitations (see chapter 5), positive effects
on child development are evident as a result of some of
these schemes. These include improvements in primary
and secondary school enrolment and attendance rates,
food consumption and height, as well as a decline in school
drop-out rates and child labour.39 In several programmes,
incentives are designed in ways that promote school
attendance among girls in particular in order to equalize
the educational opportunities of boys and girls. In Mexico,
there is evidence that such incentives have helped reduce
the gender gap in schooling.40
The South African Child Support Grant, which is given to
the primary care provider, is not conditional on a recipient’s
behaviour. The programme, which replaced the ethnically
based State Maintenance Grant in 1998 as a poverty-oriented policy measure, is a means-tested grant payable to the
primary caregiver (not necessarily the biological mother
or father).41 Estimates suggest that well over 80 per cent
of eligible children are beneﬁting from the grant, with a
positive impact on their development.42 Some of the existing research shows that conditional cash transfers increase
children’s school enrolment and attendance rates (research
on Bolsa Familia in Brazil excepted) and result in improved
health. However, there is very little evidence that it is the

197

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

conditionalities that have brought about these changes, as
opposed to the simple injection of additional cash into a
household. Indeed, evidence from South Africa reveals the
markedly positive impact of unconditional grants.43

care-related tasks, but also risk overburdening women
whose (paid and unpaid) inputs into household survival
have both diversiﬁed and intensiﬁed in many developing
countries.48

Positive ﬁndings notwithstanding, the proliferation of
cash grants targeted to children and the elderly in poor
households raises some important issues. First, while cash
transfers may assist poor households in paying user fees and
accessing poor-quality public health and education services, they are no substitute for quality public services as
evidence from advanced industrialized countries shows.44
Despite South Africa’s child support grant, for example, the
country lags behind in coverage of preschool for children
aged 3 to 5 (see ﬁgure 7.4). This may reﬂect the fact that
spending on cash grants has taken the policy and advocacy
focus away from the need for public investment in decent
social and care services. While welfare spending increased
sharply between 2000 and 2007, the budget for social services remained fairly stable.45

Social assistance pensions for the elderly. Positive ﬁndings have also been documented for social assistance pensions (see chapter 5). In South Africa, for example, the
means-tested Old Age Pension has been praised for being
well targeted in ethnic and gender terms, and valued for
its reliability. There is also evidence that the Old Age
Pension stimulates care provision, bolsters the security of
households in which elderly people live, contributes to
the livelihood of elderly people themselves, and of other
and younger family members.49 However, the fact that
such pensions may be spent on other household members raises the question of the adequacy of such fungible
cash beneﬁts for securing adequate care for elderly people
themselves. This is especially true for elderly women, who
cannot rely on a spouse to care for them in the way that
elderly men often can, given the fact that women very
often live longer than men and marry or cohabit with men
older than themselves.

Positive ﬁndings notwithstanding,
the proliferation of cash grants targeted
to children and the elderly in poor
households raises contentious issues
A second contentious issue is whether these cash beneﬁts
empower women and increase their autonomy vis-à-vis men
in the same household. While an evaluation of the Mexican programme found that access to cash had increased
women’s voice in household decision making,46 others have
raised concerns about men withholding their ﬁnancial contributions in households where women receive the transfer.47 A regular and reliable source of income in the hands
of women can assist them in their responsibilities as caregivers, particularly in contexts where a large proportion of
women have to juggle household survival and care on their
own, as in South Africa. However, conditional cash transfers that come with heavy co-responsibilities that women
have to assume not only discourage men from assuming

198

The policy debates on care for old and very old people
often focus on ﬁnancial issues (pensions). This is to some
extent understandable. However, it also presents a partial view of the policy challenges that population ageing
entails. The organization and distribution of the practical
work of caring for the elderly constitutes another important set of considerations often left out of policy debates;
in many countries these are now urgent issues requiring
policy redress.50 Gender inequalities can also be found in
this domain. For example, women are the main caregivers
for the very old and frail, yet they are in a weaker position
than their male counterparts to demand care (whether paid
or unpaid) when they become old and frail themselves.

Confronting deﬁcits: Care in agrarian economies
with large informal labour markets
Many low- and lower-middle-income countries face formidable challenges in addressing even basic care needs.
Explicit care policies and programmes are few and far

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 7 – CARE AND WELL-BEING IN A DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

between, and those that do exist are often characterized by
low coverage and poor quality. This section offers evidence
from three countries – India, Nicaragua and the United
Republic of Tanzania – to show how care has entered the
public policy agenda.

Many low- and lower-middle-income
countries face formidable challenges in
addressing even basic care needs

All three countries have extensively informal labour markets; their social protection measures are largely directed
to the smaller segment of the population that is engaged
in formal employment. Coverage of public health and primary education tends to be inadequate and of poor quality,
and specialized care services (for preschoolers or those with
AIDS) are also rudimentary. To this must be added the
heavy demands that poor and inaccessible infrastructure
place on such households, especially on women and girls
(see box 7.2). Hence, much of the burden of caregiving
is shifted to the unpaid economy, with women putting in
relatively long hours of work (see ﬁgure 7.3).

BOX 7.2: United Republic of Tanzania: The time burden of collecting water and fuel
The time it takes to collect water is signiﬁcant in many developing countries. In the United Republic of Tanzania, people spend an
average of 16 minutes each day collecting water (if the time spent on water collection is averaged out over the entire population aged
5 years and older). If the time spent by only those who collect water is averaged, it rises to 28 minutes each day. One-tenth of water
collectors spend 54 minutes or more on average per day fetching water.

These time use data also show that 69 per cent of those who reported that they collect ﬁrewood or other forms of fuel were female.
When age and sex are considered together, 39 per cent of women aged 18–49 years, and 16 per cent of men, reported some collection
of fuel over a seven-day period. Engagement in fuel collection is noticeably lower for girls and boys, at 27 per cent and 19 per cent,
respectively, but higher than suggested by what household heads reported.

As with water collection, the poorest households bear the heaviest burdens. Data show that 42 per cent of females and 22 per cent
of males from the poorest households collect fuel, compared to 15 per cent of females and 7 per cent of males in relatively wealthy
households. In rural areas, 33 per cent of respondents collect fuel compared to only 7 per cent in urban areas.

In terms of time spent, those who collect fuel spend an average of 25 minutes a day on this speciﬁc task. Nine in 10 collectors spend
48 minutes or more on average a day collecting fuel. Given that fuel collection may not be carried out on a daily basis, the amount of
time spent on a particular day could be much longer.

As illustrated in table 7.3, public spending on education
constitutes a smaller percentage of GDP in the United
Republic of Tanzania than in India or Nicaragua. While
both India and the United Republic of Tanzania spend very
little on the health of their citizens (compared to Nicaragua), government health expenditure per capita is higher
in the United Republic of Tanzania than in India. Health
spending in the United Republic of Tanzania, however,
needs to be considered alongside the substantial increase
in the demand for health services as a result of HIV
and AIDS.
On a range of outcome indicators – including infant mortality rates and births attended by skilled personnel – the
United Republic of Tanzania does more poorly than the
other two countries, as might be expected from the combination of very low levels of income, relatively low spending
on public health and formidable health challenges.
However, India’s relatively poor performance compared to
Nicaragua, despite their roughly similar levels of per capita

200

income and poverty, is striking. If we add to this India’s
impressive growth rates over the past decade, stronger state
administrative capacity compared to both Nicaragua and
the United Republic of Tanzania,51 and the fact that the
country enjoys greater policy and ﬁscal space due to the
marginal role of international donors, it is reasonable to
conclude that political impediments to state action in
India are daunting.
The following sections describe some of the social programmes that directly or inadvertently address the care
burden of households, focusing on HIV and AIDS in the
United Republic of Tanzania and on children in the other
two countries.
United Republic of Tanzania. In this country, as in
other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, creeping liberalization of health services, together with the introduction of
market principles in the public system during the 1990s,
have led to the exclusion of large segments of the population.52 Though exemption and waiver systems were

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 7 – CARE AND WELL-BEING IN A DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

designed to mitigate the impact of user fees on the poor,
widespread difﬁculties in their implementation suggest a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial burden on poor households.
The impact of HIV and AIDS has placed enormous additional stress on the formal health care system, which
had serious problems addressing citizens’ basic needs
even before the epidemic. While HIV and AIDS create
an ever-increasing demand for health services, human
resources are not often sufﬁcient to meet it. The total health
workforce declined by 28 per cent between 1994/1995 and
2000/2001, and by a further 10 per cent by 2005/2006,53
in part due to the out-migration of health personnel,
particularly nurses, to countries that offer better wages
and working conditions.

Home-based care services are
severely underfunded, receiving only
about 1–2 per cent of government
and donor spending on HIV/AIDS
in sub-Saharan Africa

In several sub-Saharan African countries, including the
United Republic of Tanzania, home-based care programmes
are being promoted to complement public health services
in coping with the enormous care demands imposed by
AIDS. In theory, trained nurses are supposed to offer skilled
support and training to community-based volunteers, and a
functional referral system is assumed to be in place to provide specialized care to patients where needed. Community
volunteers are theoretically supplied with a small transport
allowance and a kit of gloves and food supplements. Their
responsibility is to visit patients affected by HIV or AIDS
in their homes and provide some basic care and support,
thereby relieving the burden on family members. The government has advocated strongly in favour of home-based
care programmes. And with funding from external donors,
several non-governmental, faith-based and community
organizations have responded positively to this call.

However, in practice, home-based care programmes face
innumerable challenges. Referral systems are weak. Volunteers, most of whom are women and poor, receive little training on even the rudimentary skills of caring for
an ill patient or even themselves while in the caregiving
role, nor are they always supplied with basic supplies and
stipends. Moreover, home-based care services are severely
underfunded, receiving only about 1–2 per cent of government and donor spending on HIV/AIDS, since the emphasis continues to be on treatment, which is heavily skewed
towards antiretroviral medications.54 Field research in the
United Republic of Tanzania suggests that home-based care
volunteers spend long hours every day on care activities
that impose major physical and emotional stress, without
receiving any compensation.55 Heavy reliance on external
sources of funding has also created serious problems of sustainability, with little opportunity for individual organizations to accumulate experience in this ﬁeld, as they shift to
other forms of intervention in the hope of attracting funds,
or simply collapse.
India. Overall enrolment in primary education has
improved substantially in India, and drop-out rates have
decreased for both boys and girls over the past 25 years.
Preschool care, however, has been largely neglected. The
policy assumption is that women are either full-time mothers or engaged in types of work (home-based, self-employed
and informal) that enable them to combine paid work with
care responsibilities. There is a lack of childcare facilities
even in legally mandated work sites, public or private,
including those established through the National Rural
Employment Guarantee Act.56
Among the urban middle classes, grandparents and domestic workers may help with care in the ﬁrst year after a
child’s birth. Outside the elite and upper-middle classes,
mothers try to interweave paid jobs with domestic and care
work through the day, carrying their children with them.
In both rural and urban working-class neighbourhoods,
children may be left with kin, neighbours or even on their
own, on the assumption that, in an emergency, the neighbours will take charge or make contact at the nearby work
sites.57 While this represents extreme cases, it also indicates

201

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

that the compulsion to work among the income-poor can
mean that women’s paid work, often as domestic workers
in middle-class and elite households, leads to a care deﬁcit
in their own homes.
Public responsibility for childcare has entered government
policy rather inadvertently through attempts to improve
levels of nutrition and lower infant and child mortality
rates. The Integrated Child Development Scheme, probably the largest child nutrition programme in the world,
emerged in India as a result of a focus on nutrition and
infant and maternal mortality, and has been expanding
since the 1990s. It has taken on a minimal care function
over time to the extent that delivery of some of the nutrition programmes required children’s presence at anganwadis
(government childcare facilities). However, opening hours
are short and erratic, staff-to-child ratios are abysmally low
and facilities and teaching materials are lacking. Anganwadis are thus not tapped by parents for daycare. Indeed,
most children come to the centres only at meal times.58

Though enrolment in primary
education has improved substantially
in India, preschool care has been
largely neglected
Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, too, coverage of primary education has increased over the past two decades. However,
unlike India and many countries in Latin America, both
preschool programmes (catering to children between 3
and 5 years of age) and childcare services (which accommodate children from birth until age 5) were created and
expanded in the early 1980s after the Sandinista revolution. A universal vision underpinned this expansion, even
if, in practice, coverage remained limited and expansion
was only possible through the mobilization and organization of volunteers that sought to bring about social change
from below.59 Over the past two decades, this element of
volunteering or community involvement has remained a
key feature of Nicaraguan social programmes, albeit for

202

different reasons (ﬁscal constraints imposed by public
sector retrenchment under structural adjustment) and
harnessed to a different model of social and economic
policy (embracing certain neoliberal elements, such as
targeting and co-responsibility).
Social programmes aimed at improving children’s nutrition and retaining them in school, as well as preschool
care, have proliferated in recent years, with many of them
highly dependent on external funding sources. This has led
to a certain degree of duplication, conﬂict of interest and
institutional discontinuity, with some externally funded programmes working at cross-purposes with already established
public social programmes. This has reduced overall impact.
Again, a common feature of social programmes, be they nutritional or preschool programmes or conditional cash transfers,
has been heavy reliance on the voluntary work of beneﬁciaries and community members, often the mothers of targeted
children. Such reliance has been particularly onerous in the
education sector, where a radical decentralization policy has
devolved school management, fundraising activities, maintenance and improvement of facilities, responsibility for
food preparation and even the hiring and ﬁring of teachers
in autonomous schools, demanding an excessive amount of
time from both teachers and parents, mostly mothers.60

4. Putting Care on the Agenda:
Implications for Policy
This chapter has shown that policies that are good for care
are not a luxury that only high-income countries can afford.
While social care services (such as those oriented towards
children or the elderly) tend to be underdeveloped in many
lower income developing countries, caregiving is facilitated
by a much wider range of factors – including access to water
and sanitation, a decent income, social protection and good
quality health and education services.
A policy environment that recognizes and values care as the
bedrock of social and economic development needs to move

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 7 – CARE AND WELL-BEING IN A DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT

progressively towards respecting the rights and needs of those
who give and receive care. The goal is to provide universal
and affordable access to care to everyone who needs it, as
well as control over how such help or assistance is given,
in order to ensure the greatest degree of independence, if
desired. In this ideal scenario, unpaid caregivers should be
able to provide care in ways that strengthen the well-being
and capabilities of those they care for without jeopardizing
their own economic security. And caregiving should become
a viable option, with adequate recognition and reward.

The goal is to provide universal
and affordable care to everyone
who needs it
While concrete policy options are country- and contextspeciﬁc, a number of priorities can be identiﬁed, guided by
the following principles.

paid work or appropriate social transfers, such as pensions
or child/family allowances. The latter are particularly
important in contexts where caregiving absorbs a signiﬁcant amount of time.

Create synergies between social
transfers and social services
Pensions and child/family allowances complement, but cannot substitute for, quality and accessible care services. The
state has an important role to play in ﬁnancing, regulating
and providing care services. This is increasingly recognized
in the area of childcare, where the challenge is to expand
coverage in ways that reduce class and regional inequalities.
One or two years of mandatory preschool can be an effective step in this direction. Policy debates on care for the
elderly, on the other hand, often focus on ﬁnancial issues,
such as pensions. Meanwhile, the need for practical support
in carrying out daily activities and the demand for longterm physical care are often neglected. In many countries,
these are now urgent issues requiring policy attention.

Invest in infrastructure and basic
social services
Investment in infrastructure (water, sanitation, electricity)
in low-income countries can signiﬁcantly increase the efﬁciency of unpaid domestic work. The availability of basic
social services (such as primary education and health care)
enhances the well-being and capabilities of service-users
and reduces the time that family members allocate to those
tasks. And both types of investment allow people more
time for other pursuits, such as self-care, education, political participation and paid work.

Ensure an adequate and reliable
source of income
In addition to time, caregiving also requires a reliable
and adequate source of income with which to access the
inputs (food, housing, transport) required for a decent
standard of living. This can be achieved through either

Build on existing programmes
to cover care needs
Low-income countries should build on existing social care
programmes. The expansion of child nutrition centres into
quality preschool/educational centres with wider coverage, or support for community-based health programmes
(through training, and resources for meals, transport and
medical kits, for example) can help provide better working
conditions for care workers and improve the quality of the
care they provide.

Recognize care workers and
guarantee their rights
Evidence from both developed and developing countries
shows that shifting some components of care work from
households to markets or the public sector does not, in and

203

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

of itself, enhance its perceived value. Nor does it change
the fact that it is carried out predominantly by women.
Policy makers must lead the shift from a strategy that relies
on market and voluntary provision of care of the most
informal and exploitative kind to one that nurtures professional, decently paid and compassionate forms of care.
This requires effective regulation and monitoring by states.
Organizations of care workers and of care recipients also
need to be involved, in order to build public conﬁdence in
such services and sustain their ﬁnancing through general
taxation. Non-proﬁt organizations and civil society associations play an increasingly important role in the delivery of
care services. It is the duty of the state to create clear standards on the rights of volunteers (including their health
and safety at work and regular stipends), and to recognize
them as workers.

Make care work more visible
In short, care has important features of a public good whose
contribution to economic growth, social development
and social cohesion extends far beyond the individual

204

care recipient. The costs of care must therefore be more
evenly distributed among all members of society. In order
to increase policy support for caregivers and care recipients, care must emerge from the private realm and become
a public issue. Towards this end, it is important to make
care work more visible through statistics as well as in public
debates. Timely and regular indicators, such as those provided by time use surveys, are needed to monitor policy
effectiveness in reducing and equalizing care burdens. Such
indicators, along with in-depth qualitative research, can
provide a care lens for assessing how policies and processes
of social change impact on care.

CHAPTER

Financing Social Policy
Previous chapters in Section two of the report have provided substantial evidence of the positive economic and
social impact of expenditures on basic social services and
social protection programmes. Although the value of such
social policies in reducing poverty and inequality is recognized, concern over their affordability remains widespread.
As ﬁscal constraints and the costs of health and elder care
grow, even mature welfare states have come under pressure
in recent decades, leading to predictions of their imminent
demise. For the most part, however, such states have managed to adjust their social systems to these pressures. Most
developing countries, on the other hand, operate within
more severe ﬁscal constraints. Moreover, globalization and
accompanying neoliberal policy prescriptions have had a
negative impact on public revenues, forcing governments
to reduce expenditures, curtailing social spending severely.
These trends have had a particularly strong impact on lowincome and aid-dependent countries.

A clear case can be made for
increasing investments in social
protection and social services in order
to make meaningful dents in the
multiple manifestations of poverty
In light of the positive development synergies explained
in previous chapters, a clear case can be made for increasing investments in social protection and social services in
order to make meaningful dents in the multiple manifestations of poverty. The United Nations Millennium Project
recognized this in calling on most developing countries to
mobilize up to an additional 4 per cent of their gross domestic product (GDP) to promote poverty reduction.1

8

Such funds can be raised from a variety of sources: internally via taxation and social insurance schemes, externally
in the form of aid or, in the case of mineral-rich countries,
by taking advantage of favourable commodity prices and
channelling rents into social programmes. Social protection
and social services can also be ﬁnanced privately through
household income, including transfers from migrant workers, and unpaid work. Obviously such public and private
sources lead to signiﬁcant differences in terms of outcomes.
This chapter analyses the contrasting effects of different
ﬁnancing sources and instruments on social development,
equality and poverty outcomes.
The availability of resources to ﬁnance social policies
depends on a country’s economic performance, including
its capacity to produce income and savings and to generate
government revenues; the performance of its domestic capital markets; and the availability of external funding such as
foreign investment, loans or grants. A dynamic economic
environment and a stable world economy are therefore key
determinants of national public ﬁnances, and it is here that
the global economic crisis has had severe consequences for
developing countries. Many are faced with sharply declining private and public revenues and falling growth rates due
to a decrease in foreign capital inﬂows, domestic credit and
remittances, falling commodity prices and worsening terms
of trade. Mobilizing additional resources or even maintaining existing levels in such a context is a major challenge.
Nonetheless, in response to the crisis, many countries are
making efforts to implement social protection programmes
alongside ﬁscal stimulus packages. Meanwhile, the international donor community has made commitments to
increase development assistance.
Mobilizing resources is, however, only part of the battle. Decisions about revenue policies and the allocation of public funds are the result of political processes,

207

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

often dominated by elite groups. Consequently, such policies may not lead to the best outcomes in terms of providing public goods and reducing poverty (see chapter 11).
Furthermore, institutional capacity, including the quality
and efﬁciency of public administration and service providers, inﬂuences how successfully resources are translated into
social outcomes (see chapter 10).

Mobilizing resources is only part of the
battle: decisions about revenue policies
and the allocation of public funds

Section 2 focuses on the links between different revenue
sources and ﬁnancing instruments and the various dimensions of social policy – redistribution, reproduction, production and protection.
Section 3 analyses the impact of selected revenue sources
on development outcomes and equality across various
social policy regimes and development contexts. It compares domestic resources such as taxation, social insurance
contributions and pension funds with sources such as mineral rents, aid and remittances.
Section 4 highlights policy lessons and remaining challenges, particularly with regard to the political economy of
ﬁnancing social policy.

1. Spending on Social Policy
The analysis in this chapter points to four main conclusions.
• To signiﬁcantly reduce poverty, more funds have to be
invested in universal social policies, especially in lowincome countries.
• Domestic ﬁnancing instruments such as taxation and
social insurance can create synergies between economic
and social development and strengthen democracy and
solidarity within states.
• Other ﬁnancing sources, such as aid, remittances
and mineral rents, can play an important role in
complementing domestic resources. This is especially
true in low-income countries characterized by high
degrees of informality, low tax revenues and low
coverage of social insurance schemes.
• The ultimate challenge is to build social programmes
on ﬁnancial arrangements that are themselves
sustainable in ﬁscal and political terms, equitable and
conducive to economic development.
Section 1 of the chapter describes how social expenditures
and public ﬁnances vary according to income level and
policy regime, how they have been affected by globalization and why social policies are affordable even for
low-income countries.

208

Social spending reﬂects both national
incomes and policy choices
In general, public social expenditure as a share of
GDP rises with income, with high-income countries in
the North spending the most. However, countries with
a comparable income level display signiﬁcantly different levels of expenditure on social protection and social
services.2 Within member countries of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),
for example, Sweden spends as much as 30 per cent of
GDP on cash beneﬁts and social services, whereas the
United States and Ireland spend only half that amount
(around 16 per cent). Middle-income countries such as
Mexico and the Republic of Korea spend between 6 and
7 per cent – lower than their respective regional averages
of 12.7 per cent for Latin America and 8.4 per cent for
emerging economies in Asia.3 Within the same region,
Brazil and Mexico, both middle-income countries, spend
13.2 and 3.5 per cent, respectively, of GDP on social protection. Mongolia spends 10.5 per cent versus 1.9 per cent
in Indonesia (see table 8.1).

The amount of public resources channelled into social
sector policies is determined by the availability of
funds and policy priorities, but administrative effectiveness also plays a role. As the case studies throughout this
report show, the size of government spending is also
determined by the division of labour between the state,
markets and households in providing social services,
which, in turn, is strongly inﬂuenced by a country’s
policy regime.
As discussed previously in this report, the amount of social
expenditure does not reveal how much of this money
actually reaches lower income groups or how effective
these expenditures are in reducing poverty or increasing
equality (see chapters 5 and 6). Nonetheless, a comparison of the shares of public social expenditure in domestic income demonstrates two important points: ﬁrst, that
social expenditure is clearly a policy variable and, second,
that the amount of resources invested in social policy (and,
most importantly, how they are spent) is determined largely
by the policy regime in a country, rather than its income
level. High-expenditure levels in former socialist countries,
such as Mongolia, and in welfare state pioneers in Latin
America, such as Argentina and Brazil, illustrate this point
(see table 8.1).

The amount of resources invested
in social policy – and how they are
spent – is largely determined by a
country’s policy regime

The global context inﬂuences the
ﬁnancing of social policy
Following the debt crises in the early 1980s, many developing countries, particularly in Latin America and subSaharan Africa, were forced to undertake signiﬁcant ﬁscal
adjustments. The radical rethinking of the role of the state
and ﬁscal expenditures during this phase of neoliberal
reform undermined the interventionist policies of developmental states, leading to the withdrawal of the state from
many policy areas and the retention of only a residual role
in social provisioning. This paradigm shift led to the substantial privatization of social programmes, public sector
retrenchment and considerable decreases in social expenditures. The reforms had differing effects on public budgets:
in some cases the privatization of public enterprises led to

209

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

transitory inﬂows of capital, whereas in the case of pension
privatization, considerable ﬁscal costs over several decades
were incurred (see below). In addition, government revenues fell as liberalization policies and international tax
competition led to shrinking revenues from trade taxes and
levies on mobile production factors such as capital. Economic crises and recessions also had adverse effects on public accounts due to a combination of higher expenditures
(including social transfers, economic subsidies and debt
service) and lower ﬁscal receipts, a scenario that is once
more a reality for many countries affected by the global
economic crisis.
Even when countries managed to maintain expenditure
levels as a percentage of GDP or the budget, especially for
health and education,4 per capita expenditures fell each
time an absolute decline in per capita GDP occurred.5
Overall, ﬁscal policy has been highly procyclical in Latin
America and sub-Saharan Africa, reducing states’ capacities

to protect the vulnerable and the poor. East Asia’s ﬁscal
policy, on the contrary, has been more countercyclical
in the post–Asian crisis period, with social expenditures
increasing during economic downturns.6
During the last decade, some countries, especially those that
performed weakly with regard to domestic revenues, have
seen increases in other types of revenues, such as development aid, remittances and natural resource rents. Increasing numbers of international migrants (usually escaping
from adverse economic conditions in their country of origin), temporarily booming commodity prices (especially
for selected minerals, oil and gas) and global initiatives to
increase aid (including the Highly Indebted Poor Countries/
HIPC initiative which aims to free up resources through
debt relief) are at the heart of this trend. The questions
then become how different sources of ﬁnance affect social
development and how ﬁnancing policies can be made more
sustainable and equitable.

BOX 8.1: Social policy is affordable – for all countries
Evidence that social policy is affordable, even for countries with low levels of income, has recently been provided by research
conducted by the International Labour Organization (ILO). A basic social protection package (comprising pensions for the elderly
and the disabled, child beneﬁts and essential health care) for low-income countries, such as Bangladesh, India, Kenya and Pakistan,
was estimated to cost around 10 per cent of GDP. Although this is more than most of these countries currently spend, it is less than the
average now spent on social protection in transition countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and some Latin American countries.
It is also far below the average spent by OECD countries, which stands at 17.3 per cent of GDP.

In a similar vein, a recent UN study of 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean suggests that the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) would be achievable for all countries in the region if they mobilized additional MDG–related public spending of between
0.9 and 6.1 per cent of GDP per year until 2015.

2. Revenue Sources and
Their Impact on Development

FIGURE 8.1: Revenue type, distribution and social
relations
Regressivity

As discussed in previous chapters, adequate levels of
social protection and the universal provision of essential
social services can improve the distribution of income
and assets in a society, transform gender relations and help
reconcile the burden of reproduction with that of other
social tasks. They also enhance the productive potential
of members of society and protect people from the vagaries of the market and the changing circumstances of age.
Achieving universal social policies and ultimately reducing poverty and inequality in developing countries requires
that both expenditure and revenue policies respond to the
principles of equity, gender equality, progressive redistribution and sustainable economic development. This section analyses how different revenue sources and ﬁnancing
mechanisms relate to these principles and dimensions of
social policy.

Expenditure and revenue
policies need to be equitable,
progressive and sustainable

Different ﬁnancing instruments
affect redistribution and reproduction
in different ways
Financing instruments can be classiﬁed according to whether
they are distributionally progressive (redistributing from rich
to poor), neutral or regressive, or based on normative principles of individualism or solidarity (see ﬁgure 8.1). For any
level of resources, ﬁnancing instruments become preferable
as their progressiveness increases (in terms of redistributing
resources towards lower income, disadvantaged or vulnerable
groups, including ethnic minorities, rural dwellers, children,
the elderly and the chronically ill).

Financing social policies through self-provisioning,
user fees or cost sharing
In the case of domestic ﬁnancing sources, as ﬁgure 8.1
indicates, the most regressive and individualistic forms of
ﬁnancing for social services or social protection are those
in which people provide for themselves (self-provisioning)
or that require out-of-pocket payment of user fees. Selfprovisioning means that households and families provide
their own services, or smooth consumption in the event of
income shocks by performing unpaid care work, drawing
down savings, selling household assets or increasing their
paid labour. User fees include informal payments to health
care providers at the point of service and cost sharing, the
latter requiring the individual to pay part of the cost of the
health care actually received. Cost sharing, whether in the
form of a ﬁxed or proportional amount per service received,
is therefore different from the payment of an insurance premium, contribution or tax, which is paid whether health
care is received or not. Particularly during the 1980s, user
fees were promoted by the international ﬁnancial institutions (IFIs) as mechanisms for raising additional revenues
and improving access, efﬁciency and quality of social services, such as health care and education. It was also thought
that people would value services more if there was some
notional fee attached to them (see chapter 6).7
The evidence, however, suggests that the adoption and
expansion of user fees has not resulted in these potential
beneﬁts (see chapters 5 and 6).8 In fact, user fees are linked
to a decline in the utilization of services, with adverse

211

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

effects on equity. Any redistribution that takes place is
usually limited to members of the same household, rather
than across different income and risk groups, and is often to
the disadvantage of women and girls within households
(see chapters 4 and 7).

since lower income groups and women spend a higher share
of their income on these goods and services.9 In theory,
taxes such as VAT can include exemptions for goods and
services related to basic needs and impose higher rates on
luxury goods in order to make distributional effects more
progressive and gender neutral.

Pre-paid schemes and public social insurance
Private insurance or pre-paid schemes, in which contributions are collected before a contingency occurs, are superior to user fees paid at the point of use in terms of both risk
pooling and administrative costs, which tend to be lower if
schemes allow for economies of scale. Insurance contributions, whether private or public, can be a ﬁscally neutral
way of ﬁnancing social protection, because the insurance
principle establishes a close link between contributions
and beneﬁts, based on the risk proﬁle of the insured and
possible dependants. However, ﬂat rate contributions are
regressive, and even proportional contributions levied as
a percentage of salaries usually do not apply to incomes
earned from investments and saving. Moreover, insurance
schemes, whether private or public, are less redistributive
in gender terms than general revenues. This is because
women tend to have lower earnings and less stable work
and earning trajectories due to their reproductive and caring roles and, especially in developing countries, because
they are concentrated in low-paid informal jobs.
With regard to private programmes, redistribution is limited to risk pooling, making them a more expensive option
for low-income earners and families unless the state intervenes to provide subsidies. Public social insurance is more
effective in increasing solidarity and redistribution. This is
especially true if the system is ﬁnanced through progressive
payroll taxes, if contributions are shared between workers
and employers, and if subsidies are provided for disadvantaged groups of the insured.

Indirect taxes levied on consumer
goods and services
Indirect taxes levied on consumer goods and services (sales
tax or value added tax/VAT), trade or speciﬁc products
(excise tax) are more regressive than progressive income
taxes. They are also more problematic in terms of gender,

212

Direct taxation of personal and corporate
income and of property
Finally, direct taxation of personal and corporate income,
along with property, is the most redistributive and gender
equalizing way of mobilizing revenue. This is especially true
if couples are taxed as individuals, if the system does not discriminate against single female-headed households, if marginal tax rates increase with income, and if no exemptions
and allowances are granted for high income earners.10
Thus, governments have a variety of domestic ﬁnancing
instruments to choose from, ranging from regressive forms
of self-provisioning to public transfers and services ﬁnanced
by direct progressive taxation, which entails potential gains
with regard to distributional justice and social reproduction.
In many developing countries, however, the more progressive options are constrained by a widespread informal economy, lower administrative capacity and the entrenched
power of domestic economic elites and external investors
to negotiate favourable tax conditions.

Mineral rents, remittances and aid
The impact of mineral rents, remittances and aid on redistribution and gender equality is more complex and is mediated by a number of context-speciﬁc factors. For example,
the effect of mineral rents on redistribution and reproduction depends on the ﬁscal regime and social policy system
in place in a country, which determine how rents from mineral wealth are extracted and redistributed. Moreover, the
concentration and enclave nature of the extractive sector,
coupled with the type of manual work involved in it, are
less likely to contribute to more equal gender opportunities
in a given country.
While sustaining the social and economic reproduction of
migrant-sending communities, remittances can transform

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 8 – FINANCING SOCIAL POLICY

but also reinforce existing inequalities and social structures,
such as gender relations, care arrangements, class and ethnic hierarchies.11 As international migration is a selective
process, most direct beneﬁts of remittances are also selective
and do not tend to ﬂow to the poorest members of communities, nor to the poorest countries.12 In general, data suggest that the non-poor often beneﬁt more, and remittance
inﬂows can initially lead to increasing inequality. However,
the poorest people might beneﬁt indirectly through positive effects of remittance expenditure on wages, prices and
employment in the communities and countries from which
migrants originate.

Remittances can transform but
also reinforce existing inequalities
and social structures
Aid represents a form of international redistribution of
resources. However, its redistributive impact at the national
level depends on the type of instrument used (loan or grant),
the sector it is intended to support (such as social services,
infrastructure, rural development or capacity building),
and the way in which it is channelled (through budget support, project funding or non-governmental organizations/
NGOs). Furthermore, its redistributive effects depend on
the conditionalities attached to it, which can include provisions related to mainstreaming gender equality. In particular, the payment of interest on loans in low-income
countries is not likely to have positive redistributive and
equity-enhancing effects when the local ﬁscal regime relies
disproportionately on indirect taxes, overburdening lowincome citizens and women.

Different ﬁnancing instruments affect
production and protection in different ways
The conventional view on public ﬁnance dominated by
neoclassical economists tends to separate funding from
expenditure policies and to ground them in different principles. Revenue policies, according to this view, should be

guided by efﬁciency norms rather than distributing from the
rich to the poor, in order to minimize adverse incentives for
domestic demand, labour supply, savings and investment.
Redistribution should then take place through targeted
expenditure policies and not through taxation or social insurance schemes. However, while some economists see possible distortions that could undermine efﬁciency and growth,
others consider the so-called automatic stabilizers – progressive tax-transfer schemes – as a means to combining redistribution with macroeconomic stabilization. In addition, as
shown in chapter 5, social insurance programmes ﬁnanced
through contributions can support economic development
in a variety of ways. For example, funded social protection
schemes such as pension funds can be a source of ﬁnance,
stimulating ﬁnancial sector development and, in the case of
occupational funds, providing “patient capital” (long-term
ﬁnancing) and wage moderation to ﬁrms, while supporting
employment stability and incentives for workers to invest in
industry-speciﬁc and/or ﬁrm-speciﬁc skills.13
An additional concern is whether domestic resources have
a different impact on economic development when compared to alternative or external resources. Export earnings
or private and ofﬁcial transfers and loans (in the form of
ofﬁcial development assistance/ODA, and remittances) are
denominated in foreign currency and have a potentially
negative effect on macroeconomic stability. In addition,
aid – grants and low-interest loans – is subject to conditionality, while loans might adversely affect debt sustainability.
Remittances, on the other hand, are difﬁcult to tap because
of the private and often informal nature of these ﬂows. The
fact that these resources are of growing importance to many
developing countries, especially lower income countries,
justiﬁes a closer analysis of their potential and challenges.
The impact of different revenue sources on protection
depends on how revenues are used. Revenues are usually not
tied to a speciﬁc spending purpose and are fungible, except
for the case of earmarked taxes, social insurance contributions and aid targeted to social provisioning. Consequently,
the impact of any revenue source on protection depends on
the level, type (public versus private) and structure (sector)
of social expenditure it ﬁnances. The social policy regime

213

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

determines the extent to which revenues are invested in
public or private provision, universal or targeted social
programmes, which implies different ways of protecting
against a range of individual and market risks with different outcomes (see chapters 5 and 6). Concrete examples of
how the relationship between revenue sources and protection plays out are examined in the following section.

3. Mobilizing Resources
for Social Policy
How have countries mobilized resources in different national
contexts and a changing global environment? This section
illustrates, through speciﬁc country experiences, the relative importance of each of the revenue sources discussed
above in terms of their impact on social development and
social policy. The ﬁndings suggest that domestic resources
should form the bedrock of revenue policies, while remittances, aid and mineral rents, if properly managed, can provide additional funds for investments in social policy.14

ownership and accountability as compared to external revenues, which in the case of aid, for example, is tied to donor
conditionality, therefore bypassing national constituencies
and political institutions (see chapters 10 and 11).17
While tax shares tend to grow as GDP does (see ﬁgure 8.2),
important variations can be found within each income
group.18 The Netherlands and Sweden collect over 45 per
cent of GDP in taxes. In Japan and the United States, the
share is less than 40 per cent; in Brazil and South Africa, it
is over 35 per cent; and in Colombia and Mexico, less than
15 per cent (all include social insurance contributions).
How can these differences be explained?

Designing equitable and efﬁcient tax
systems is key to development
In developing countries, designing equitable and efﬁcient
tax systems is key to ﬁnancing social policy in a context
of consistent national development strategies and strong
state-citizen relationships. The mobilization of domestic
resources through tax reform was considered a pillar of the
2002 Monterrey Consensus on Financing for Development
and its follow-up declaration in Doha in 2008.15 It is also
recommended as the principal ﬁnancing strategy (together
with limited public and foreign borrowing, reallocation
of funds and efﬁciency-enhancing measures) for Latin
America and the Caribbean for achieving the MDGs.16
Taxation revenue is generally deemed superior to other
sources because of its stability and its potential for distributional justice and for ﬁnancing programmes with universal coverage. Tax systems are also said to enhance state

Tax capacity in developing countries is determined by
the level of development, economic structure (size of the
informal sector, size of wage employment, share of agriculture or primary products, reliance on trade), institutional
legacies, and political-institutional factors such as state
capacity, credibility and what could be labelled tax effort.
In many countries, trade liberalization policies have led to
the shrinking of total tax revenues, despite the fact that
efforts were made to make up for losses through new and
supposedly less distortionary taxes, such as consumption
taxes. Several studies19 show mixed results for the recovery

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 8 – FINANCING SOCIAL POLICY

of lost trade revenues, but the positive trends largely reﬂect
gains in middle-income countries from the implementation of VAT.20 In contrast, low-income countries, by and
large, have not enjoyed revenue gains from such taxes due
to problems with refund and credit mechanisms, underpayment and high levels of informality.21

corporate income, proﬁts and capital gains have, on average, fallen. Tax revenues have also been negatively affected
by economic crises, de-industrialization and growing informalization – particularly in Latin America, sub-Saharan
Africa and transition economies.

Tax systems across regions and selected countries
Recent tax reforms have not only led to shrinking tax revenues; they have also switched the overall tax structure
towards more regressive consumption taxes. Table 8.2 shows
that revenue from VAT as a percentage of GDP increased
in Latin America, East Asia and South Africa between the
second half of the 1970s and 2002. Meanwhile, in Latin
America, personal income and property taxes, and taxes on

East Asia. In East Asia, tax rates, especially payroll taxes
for social insurance, have been moderate to low. However,
a diversiﬁed tax structure, high compliance and positive
economic performance in recent decades have resulted in
relatively high and increasing tax receipts, especially with
regard to progressive direct taxation (see table 8.2), which
is now three to four times higher than in Latin America.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Brazil and South Africa. These two middle-income countries, featuring dualistic structures in both their economic
and social systems, exhibit high tax-to-GDP shares when
compared to their regional averages (see tables 8.2 and
8.3). In the case of Brazil, tax receipts as a percentage of
GDP increased from 17 per cent in 1980 to 21.1 per cent in
2004. When social security contributions are included, they
rose from 22.7 to 35.9 per cent, with the highest receipts
obtained from the value added communication and transportation tax collected at the state level.24
Tax policy in Brazil is caught between competing demands.
On the one hand, it is shaped by relatively orthodox economic policies aimed at higher revenues in order to service Brazil’s huge debt and to achieve budget surpluses for
the purpose of macroeconomic stabilization. On the other
hand, it is confronted with social demands due to persistent
problems of poverty and inequality. More recently, Brazil
is among the countries aiming at a gradual rebalancing of
expenditure, away from social insurance and towards social
assistance (see chapter 5).25 The country is also experimenting with forms of direct involvement by citizens in the
budget process (see chapter 10). In Porto Alegre, the support of the Workers’ Party has been central to the success of
participatory budgeting initiatives, which have raised the
legitimacy of local government among the poor and middle
classes, created more and better pro-poor expenditure, and
raised local tax collection from wealthier groups.26

216

In South Africa, institutional legacies, a strong party system, and strong economic growth (when compared to the
rest of sub-Saharan Africa) have all contributed to positive
tax performance. In addition, the South African Revenue
Service has successfully managed to broaden the tax base and
to improve tax compliance.27 Increased revenue, in combination with decreasing expenditure, has helped to reduce the
ﬁscal deﬁcit, as ﬁgure 8.3 shows. With 14.6 per cent of GDP in
tax receipts from corporate income, proﬁts and capital gains
(see table 8.2), South Africa holds the highest rank in the
developing world. The South African ﬁscal system, on both
the revenue and expenditure sides, is considered to be fairly
progressive. National studies of ﬁscal incidence demonstrate
that there is considerable redistribution through the budget,
from rich taxpayers to poor households, especially through
old-age pensions, other welfare programmes and educational
spending.28 Personal income tax has declined as a proportion of GDP, but company tax has risen. Overall, direct taxes
(57 per cent of total) have risen slightly, whereas indirect
taxes have fallen (comprising 43 per cent).

The Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China show
the highest rates of progressive income tax, whereas direct
taxes are considerably lower in Hong Kong, China and
Singapore. In Taiwan Province of China, similarly to the
Republic of Korea, democratization brought some fundamental changes to the local ﬁscal policy, which has become
much more expansive in an attempt to ﬁnance a new
emerging welfare state.22 In comparison to other regions of
the developing world, Asia – East Asia in particular – still
beneﬁts from healthy ﬁscal balances. This inheritance provided states with more options to expand public insurance
and services as democratization and world market integration advanced,23 with scope to increase tax rates to mobilize higher public revenues.

India. Largely due to the informal nature of the Indian
economy, tax revenue accounts for a low 15 per cent of

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 8 – FINANCING SOCIAL POLICY

with multiple exemptions for direct taxes on income and
proﬁts indicate that the overall structure tends to be regressive. Incomes below a threshold of $206 per month are
exempt from taxation, narrowing the tax base to around
40 million taxpayers.29 Additional factors contributing to
the low tax intake are the lack of a social security system,
the large informal sector, large-scale evasion and legal tax
avoidance via exemptions and incentives, as well as tax
reforms reducing tariffs, especially on trade. Improved tax
administration and compliance are considered of crucial
importance in raising public revenues in India. Also, from
the point of view of equality and growth, there is ample
room to improve the system, which at present largely
favours bigger enterprises and higher income groups.

Mineral-rich countries. The diverse group of mineral-rich
countries, including Norway (one of the richest countries
in the world), many middle-income countries such as Chile
and Malaysia, as well as very poor countries such as Angola,
Bolivia and Chad, also reﬂect huge differences in existing
welfare systems and underlying ﬁscal and tax regimes.30
As table 8.3 shows, many of the higher tax states in subSaharan Africa, such as Botswana, Nigeria and Zambia,
are in fact mineral-rich countries, receiving the bulk
of their revenues from the minerals sector. In contrast,
trade and, more recently, consumption taxes are relatively
more important in the group of so-called merchant states
– countries relying on export of primary products, such as
Kenya and Senegal.31

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Within Latin America, Chile, one of the world’s leading
copper producers, is also among the group of relatively
strong tax states. Tax receipts from mining account for
roughly 35 per cent of total ﬁscal revenues, and more than
half of these receipts originate from CODELCO, the stateowned Chilean copper company.32 After extensive public
debate on the capture of mineral rents by the private sector,
which beneﬁted from extensive tax privileges in the past,33
a speciﬁc tax on mining activities (the so-called Royalty 2)
was introduced in 2005. As a result, $544 million was collected in 2006 and $730 million the following year.34

Taxation as a social contract between
citizens and the state
The analysis presented in this chapter highlights the importance of recognizing taxation as an intrinsic dimension of
the state, and the need to design tax systems that reﬂect a
social contract that inextricably links citizens and the state.
There is a clear case as to why progressive forms of taxation
are best suited to foster nation building and social cohesion
over the long term, although it is well known that direct
and progressive taxation policies are difﬁcult to implement
in a context of highly unequal distributional patterns, low
wages, a predominantly informal economy, and low state
capacity and legitimacy.

Progressive forms of taxation are best
suited to foster nation building and
social cohesion over the long term
More than with other revenue sources, therefore, it is critical to establish a culture of taxation based on mutual trust,
and to adapt systems to local circumstances. This tends
to make tax reform a long-term endeavour rather than a
quick ﬁx. Furthermore, this means that, at times, taxing
exports or land or establishing marketing boards can serve
as a functional equivalent to taxing landowners or highincome earners directly (see chapter 10).35 The surplus generated by marketing boards, to give an example, was often
similar to total tax collection from other sources, especially

218

in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1960s and 1970s. It should,
however, be acknowledged that not only rich peasants
but also many rural poor were taxed by the controlled
price policy of the boards. As a second possible device,
earmarked taxes, although criticized by some economists
for reducing the ﬁscal autonomy of the government,
can be another way of fostering political support for new
revenues.36 The challenge is to ﬁnd ways of guaranteeing
that both parties – taxpayers and the state – will comply.
The latter also calls for coordinated action at the international level to complement national efforts for reducing
tax avoidance and tax evasion, which has been estimated
to account for revenue losses of $385 billion per year in
developing countries.37

Extension of social insurance schemes
is a challenge for developing countries
Social insurance schemes are a common instrument to
ﬁnance and provide social transfers. They can be initiated
on a small scale and gradually extended to other groups
of citizens as the formal economy expands, as shown in
chapter 5. Nevertheless, the fact that demographic change
and, more recently, labour market ﬂexibility are resulting
in shrinking numbers of active contributors and growing
numbers of beneﬁciaries raises a key question: how can
extending social insurance programmes become a viable
ﬁnancial option for developing countries?
In most countries, the supposed attraction of contribution-ﬁnanced schemes – their ﬁscal neutrality – no
longer holds true. Increasing subsidies to make up for
deﬁcits, unless explicitly used to incorporate low-income
groups (see chapter 5), not only creates a ﬁscal problem,
but is also questionable in terms of equity: most low income
earners in developing countries are excluded from formal
social insurance programmes. If these programmes beneﬁt from subsidies ﬁnanced via general revenues, regressive redistribution might take place, especially if subsidies
beneﬁt special programmes such as civil servants’ pensions (see chapter 5), and the tax system relies heavily on
consumption taxes.

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 8 – FINANCING SOCIAL POLICY

Pension funds: A balance between social
protection and development
Social insurance programmes can be set up for contingencies, such as sickness, disability and death of the main
breadwinner, old age, work accidents and unemployment.
This section concentrates on pension insurance, given its
relevance in terms of competing reform models and the
magnitude of funding involved. Pension insurance can be
organized according to different models, such as public, private or occupationally based (enterprise-related) insurance
schemes. They can be further broken down into funded
schemes, in which beneﬁts depend on past contributions
and the individual characteristics of the insured, and redistributive (pay-as-you-go/PAYG) schemes. Both models
are ﬁnanced through contributions. In the case of PAYG
schemes, such contributions are usually shared between
workers and their employers and are ideally designed as
progressive payroll taxes. The extent to which the state is
involved in social insurance schemes depends on the characteristics of a country’s social policy regime, ranging from
basic normative and regulatory interventions, as in the case
of East Asia,38 South Africa and parts of Latin America,39
to extensive ﬁnancial contributions, as in the case of
the Western European, former socialist and some Latin
American welfare states.
At the macro level, pension funds have constituted a
domestic source of ﬁnance. In Finland, for example, funds
from the partially funded pension scheme were used in
the post-war era for investments in housing, electriﬁcation
of the country and to build up national industry.40 The same
applies to provident funds in East Asia. Such funds in Hong
Kong, China; Malaysia; and Singapore have partly ﬁnanced
domestic investment, housing in particular, or contributed
to stabilization through forced savings and investment of
funds abroad.41 In successful cases, national pension funds
have contributed to economic development, and their
growth contribution has secured their own long-term
solvency.42 In unsuccessful cases, the erosion of funds
due to inﬂation and mismanagement or gradual depletion
of funds in the case of maturing pension schemes
has resulted in the conversion of funded schemes into
PAYG systems.

In Finland, funds from the pension
scheme were used for investments in
housing, electriﬁcation and to build
up national industry
Privatizing pension funds. Against this “natural” transition from pre-funding to PAYG ﬁnancing, Chile, in 1981,
chose the opposite sequencing. The country privatized
the public pension scheme and introduced fully funded
individual pension accounts for the insured. Since then,
privately managed and decentralized funds have been created in a number of Latin American and Eastern European countries, as well as in China and in Nigeria.43 These
reforms have been justiﬁed on the grounds of efﬁciency and
accumulation, as part of structural adjustment and greater
reliance on markets.44 It has been argued that these reforms
will not only lead to greater personal savings and reduced
ﬁscal burdens in the future, but will also contribute to the
establishment of stock markets and deepening of the ﬁnancial sector, which is considered necessary for efﬁciently
allocating capital and promoting growth.45
Privatizing pension funds raises a number of issues in the context of ﬁnancing development. First, preconditions for implementing private schemes are demanding. Funded schemes
are risky when ﬁnancial and banking systems are not well
developed and regulated, and they are especially vulnerable
during ﬁnancial and economic crises, as the recent situation
forcefully shows. Chile lost almost 12 per cent of GDP in
accumulated pension assets between 2007 and 2008.46
The second issue for concern regards the actual investment
of pension funds. In the case of transition from a public
PAYG system, the majority of funds are invested in public debt in order to ﬁnance transition costs. Transition
costs occur once contributors start paying into individual
accounts and the public scheme is left without revenues,
but still has to pay current pensions and compensate the
insured, who switched to the private scheme, for their
past contributions. In order for pension reform to remain

219

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

cost-efﬁcient – one of the key objectives of pension privatization – governments must usually cut beneﬁts and
entitlements, potentially undermining social goals such
as coverage, gender equality, income security and poverty
reduction. The insured not only bear these costs as taxpayers and future beneﬁciaries, but they also shoulder high
administrative costs associated with decentralized funds (in
Latin America, these amounted to an average of 9 per cent
of collected contributions in 2009),47 considerably lowering rates of return on their pension savings.
In Chile, transition costs are spread over a 30-year period.
They were as high as 4.7 per cent of GDP in 1984 and are
expected to decline gradually until they reach approximately 1.5 per cent in 2010.48 To close the rising coverage
gap caused by privatization, Chile introduced a non-contributory basic pension and subsidies to low-income groups
in 2008, at an estimated cost of around 1 per cent of GDP
annually.49 In the case of Argentina, the transition costs
associated with the introduction of a second pillar of private
pension accounts in 1994 caused a ﬁscal deﬁcit that was
deemed unsustainable in view of the country’s monetary
regime. These costs also prompted creditors to withdraw
their funds in 2001, leading to the worst crisis in the history
of the country (see chapter 5). After implementing several
small reform measures to strengthen the public pillar of the
Argentine pension system, the government ﬁnally opted
to re-nationalize it. In the midst of international ﬁnancial
turmoil in November 2008, accumulated pension assets of
approximately $30 billion were transferred to the public
sector. The government justiﬁed the reform by referencing
numerous shortcomings of the private scheme, including
its demonstrated vulnerability in times of ﬁnancial crisis,
and its objective of using the funds to reactivate the economy.50 Critics suspect ﬁscal motives played a major role in
the reform project, fearing funds could be decapitalized
when used as a cheap ﬁnancing instrument for the public
sector (for example, if invested in securities with negative
real interest rates), as has happened in the past.51
As shown above, the challenge with pension insurance
is to strike a delicate balance between designing models guaranteeing adequate protection levels for the aged,

220

while also contributing positively to economic development and creating appropriate governance structures for
these institutions. The stronger the economic and institutional environment, the more likely that pension systems will contribute to both objectives: social protection
and economic development. Given the inherent risks and
shortcomings of the private model, however, it seems reasonable to focus reform efforts on enhancing equity and
efﬁciency in public PAYG schemes and on strengthening
basic pensions that beneﬁt the majority of the population.

A wealth of mineral resources does
not necessarily enrich people
If the lack of sufﬁcient revenues is considered a major
problem for social policies in developing countries, those
countries that are richly endowed with natural resources,
especially oil and gas, should presumably be fortunate. For
many developing countries, natural resource rents represent
a substantial and growing proportion of total government
revenues, either by means of taxation or royalty payments
or direct ownership, with potentially enormous implications for the design and delivery of social policies. Before
commodity prices dropped in the context of the recent global economic crisis, these countries experienced a mineral
bonanza (especially due to skyrocketing oil prices, as shown
in ﬁgure 8.4), which could potentially produce a big push
for the development process.52 Yet there is considerable evidence that many resource-abundant countries have not been
able to utilize their resources to induce a process of sustained
economic growth, let alone social development involving
equitable distribution of the fruits of this natural wealth and
overall improvements in the welfare of their citizens.

However, numerous resource-rich countries do not suffer
from these symptoms, which points to the more interesting
issue of explaining these variations in outcomes. The main
task for research should therefore be to identify intervening
variables, such as economic and social policies, or political
institutions, that mediate the relationship between mineral-led development paths and developmental outcomes.

Mineral-rich countries are often said to suffer from a
“resource curse”, a supposed correlation between natural
resource abundance on the one hand, and a set of negative economic, political and social outcomes on the other.53

One precondition for successfully tapping mineral wealth
for social development is to avoid falling into the trap of
“Dutch disease” (see box 8.2). This requires macroeconomic policies that counteract inﬂationary pressures arising from the huge inﬂow of foreign exchange stemming
from the mineral sector, with negative effects on stability
and the competitiveness of manufacturing. Equally important are investments in infrastructure, such as electricity
and transport, and in technologies that reduce the adverse
environmental effects of mining. Lastly, improved taxation
systems and contracts with private investors are crucial to
ensure a fair share of income for the state.54

BOX 8.2: Mineral rents and “Dutch disease”
Dutch disease is one of the most extensively studied conduits through which revenue booms affect development in mineral-rich
countries. It refers to a situation in which the real exchange rate appreciates in periods of resource booms, thereby negatively
affecting competitiveness in non-mineral tradable sectors, in particular agriculture and industry. Dutch disease was ﬁrst recognized
in the Netherlands following that country’s discovery of natural gas in the North Sea in 1960. In 1976, gas revenue in the Netherlands
amounted to $5.5 billion, most of which was too quickly spent, pushing up internal demand and prices. This led to a strong guilder (then
the Dutch currency). Subsequently, the manufacturing sector declined sharply and experienced a 16 per cent loss of employment. The
state struggled to save jobs and to maintain its welfare commitments. By 1982, its budget deﬁcit was 7 per cent of GDP.

Countries can act to prevent or mitigate Dutch disease: instead of spending windfall revenues on domestic non-tradables, they can
buy imports or remove the money from circulation by saving it or paying off debt. In this way, the relative domestic price of tradables
and non-tradables would remain the same, implying no change in the real exchange rate. Thus, real exchange rate appreciation is
determined by the spending and savings decisions of governments. Dutch disease is thus as much a policy phenomenon as it is a
macroeconomic one.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Resource-rich countries such as Botswana, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia and Norway have managed the challenge
of Dutch disease reasonably well, applying different policy
instruments. These include monetary sterilization, reserve
accumulation, repayment of foreign debt, purchase of
imports, forced savings through budget surpluses or creation of stabilization or pension funds, capital controls to
reduce speculative short-term inﬂows, and social pacts to
enforce wage restraint. However, some of these countries
have not been as successful in terms of fostering democratic
governance and equitable social policies. Chile, Indonesia
and Malaysia have undermined democratic rights and civil
society during long-term dictatorships or electoral democracies with one-party rule and with social policies whose
main purpose was to legitimize authoritarian rule.

The Norwegian model
One way of using mineral windfalls to ﬁnance social protection schemes is to channel revenues into long-term
pension funds. Doing so can simultaneously accomplish
the two objectives of stabilization and social protection,
at least during the build-up phase of the pension funds. In
Norway, the Government Petroleum Fund established in
1990 (renamed the Government Pension Fund Global in
2006) is a model of such a policy. The aim of the fund is
to ensure sustainable and transparent use of income from
the oil sector by channelling all proceeds (in terms of tax
revenue and gains from direct public ownership) into this
fund. Accumulated wealth in the Government Pension
Fund amounts to about $400 billion, which is slightly less
than Norway’s annual GDP.55 Since 2001, only 4 per cent

222

(the supposed long-term rate of return) of the fund has
been transferred annually into the state budget. However,
the fact that domestic investment of the fund is forbidden,
which in normal times adds to macroeconomic stabilization, has been disastrous in the recent economic crisis: the
fund incurred losses of over $90 billion in 2008.56
Among other factors cited as most relevant to Norway’s
success in overcoming the resource curse are the quality of
its institutions; parliamentary democracy and active civil
society; development of a technology-intensive industry for
offshore drilling; high involvement of the Norwegian state,
including direct ownership of the national oil company,
Statoil; and the fact that Norway was already an advanced
industrialized country when oil was discovered.57 A considerable part of the country’s oil wealth has been transferred
to citizens in the form of increased welfare spending on
social protection and social services, rather than through
tax cuts or gasoline subsidies that tend to favour higher
income groups.58 The expansion of the welfare state has
also been reﬂected in increased employment (especially
among women) in the social sector, thus compensating for
some job losses in the manufacturing sector.

Bolivia: Financing social pensions
though mineral wealth
In contrast to Norway, mineral-rich developing countries
such as Bolivia, Nigeria and Venezuela are characterized
by intense pressure to spend revenues quickly in order to
improve the intolerable living conditions of the majority of
their populations. This is especially true if political leaders
have been voted in on the basis of a popular platform that
advocates redistribution of income. Such pressure often
leads to social and political conﬂict, as the case of Bolivia
clearly demonstrates.
Bolivia’s ﬁrst non-contributory pension scheme for the elderly, Bono Solidario or Bonosol, was ﬁnanced by dividends
generated from state-owned shares in a number of energy,
oil, gas and communications enterprises privatized in the
1990s.59 It paid an annual beneﬁt of $235 to people over
65. In 2006, oil and gas industries were re-nationalized and
private companies compelled to sign new contracts with

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 8 – FINANCING SOCIAL POLICY

the Bolivian state, thus undermining Bonosol’s funding.
A new and expanded universal pension, Renta Dignidad,
replaced Bonosol in 2007. The scheme is ﬁnanced through
the direct hydrocarbons tax, a levy of 32 per cent on the
production of hydrocarbons introduced in 2005. The tax
aims at redistributing mineral rents to poorer regions,
indigenous peoples, agricultural communities, universities
and other public institutions. Resources are invested in
education, health, infrastructure and productive activities
that lead to the generation of employment.
The ﬁnancing of Renta Dignidad was not among the
original uses of the tax, and it provoked strong resistance
from entities that would see their share of the tax revenue
reduced, especially in regions governed by the opposition
to President Evo Morales’s party. First payments began in
February 2008, amid strong support from the pensioners’
federation, peasant organizations and other social groups,
with claimants totalling 676,000 at the end of 2008.60
Tensions between the government and the other sectors
and groups beneﬁting from the hydrocarbon tax revenue
exploded in August 2008, when it was decided to increase
the annual amount of the pension due to high international
gas prices. Thus, while Renta Dignidad has gained the status of an acquired right, at least among its recipients, the
way towards progressive improvements and extensions of
the scheme is still subject to negotiations among different
actors and development priorities competing for the use of
mineral rents, and will ultimately depend upon the volume of these rents. In this sense, recent declines in exports
(in March 2009 export levels were 25 per cent less than
for the same month in 200861) and in prices of natural gas
(a 42 per cent decline between January and early April 2009)
due to falling demand highlight the risks associated with
ﬁnancing Bolivia’s social pension, and social policies in
general, with highly volatile resources.
Overall, it is reasonable to posit that successful management of mineral rents is a demanding task, especially
for developing countries with weak political and economic
contexts and where distributional struggles and inequality loom large. In spite of tremendous social needs, the
capacity of low-income countries to absorb funds without

causing macroeconomic instability is often limited, which
calls for a cautious approach in terms of the ﬁscal and
monetary management of these ﬂows. The contrasting
examples of Norway and Bolivia show that it is crucial to
construct a social consensus about the use of mineral rents
for development.

Aid can contribute to social development
and international justice
When identifying possible ﬁnancing sources for development,
taxation and aid are often juxtaposed against each other due
to their different effects on economic and political systems.
Yet external funding through international development
cooperation remains an important pillar of development
ﬁnance. International donors have agreed to substantially
increase ODA for low-income countries in order to accelerate the MDG process. And, although development assistance
in the past has shown a procyclical pattern with regard to
global economic boom and bust cycles, donors have promised
to maintain ODA levels despite the recent economic crisis.

The upsides and downsides of aid
Additional funding for poor countries can ease ﬁnancial
constraints. But, like rents from natural resources, aid
ﬂows are volatile (see box 8.3), tend to parallel global and
national economic trends, and pose a variety of political
and economic challenges. These challenges are related to
conditionality, accountability and the effects of Dutch disease (see box 8.2), which have to be addressed successfully
in order to make aid more effective for development.

223

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

BOX 8.3: Aid – Good intentions are slow to materialize
Despite rich countries’ recurring commitments to provide 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to ofﬁcial development assistance,
total ODA from OECD donors as a percentage of their combined gross national incomes consistently falls below this target (see
ﬁgure 8.5). In absolute numbers, ODA has been on the rise since the 2000s. It peaked between 2005 and 2006 due to large Paris
Club debt-relief operations for Iraq and Nigeria, and special humanitarian assistance provided for the Indian Ocean tsunami and
earthquake in Pakistan.a After a slight decrease between 2006 and 2007, aid reached $119.8 billion in 2008, the highest dollar ﬁgure
ever recorded.b However, as a proportion of gross national incomes, aid ﬂows have been decreasing since 2006.

The volatility of aid ﬂows is increased by geopolitics, which tends to play a decisive role in the global redistribution of funds. Postconﬂict countries, such as Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iraq, accounted for over 60 per cent of the total
ODA increase between 2001 and 2004. Estimations of the volume of aid needed to help developing countries cope with the global
economic crisis and achieve the MDGs have included the proposal to dedicate 0.7 per cent of rich countries’ stimulus packages (about
$15 billion) to a vulnerability fund for the poorest developing countriesd and to raise $1 trillion in aid.e A portion of these funds will be
needed to help developing countries classiﬁed as highly indebted cope with debt distress brought about by the crisis, as growth rates
and export earnings fall and shifts in exchange rates affect repayment ability.f

Though aid has recently picked up (see ﬁgure 8.5), future trends may not be promising. Indeed, the global economic crisis could well
lead to cutbacks in aid budgets as advanced industrialized countries strive to deal with growing domestic ﬁscal deﬁcits and take up
huge ﬁnancial commitments to rescue their domestic markets.g In addition, recent injections of resources into multilateral agencies,
such as the IMF, the World Bank and the regional banks, are shifting the composition of assistance ﬂows towards loan facilities
rather than development aid strictly interpreted (based on non-refundable grants). At the same time, UN agencies are not being
allocated additional funds. Despite the recapitalization and creation of new ﬁnancing facilities within the Bretton Woods institutions,
there is a danger that these new funds will largely bypass the poorer, most vulnerable countries and instead be directed mainly
towards emerging markets and middle-income countries.h Indeed, substantial reforms of the IMF’s and World Bank’s loan design
and governance mechanisms, which currently exclude developing countries, are being increasingly advocated in order to ensure
that policy recommendations and conditionalities attached to the loans promote countercyclical policies, protect social spending and
target poverty reduction.

Besides bilateral and multilateral aid, new international sources of development ﬁnance are emerging. Some of these, such as global
funds and special drawing rights, already exist; others have been proposed or introduced only recently, such as luxury taxes, currency
transaction taxes or taxes on activities with a negative environmental impact, such as air ﬂights.i In addition, South-South transfers are
becoming increasingly important as a means of international redistribution, including ODA by Southern donors (China or Venezuela),
regional integration initiatives and South-South banks.j

Besides inﬂuencing government social spending, aid also
affects measures of aggregate welfare – either directly,
by creating income-earning opportunities and providing
services, or indirectly, by contributing to growth.63 Finally,
there is robust evidence that aid does indeed ﬁnance government social spending to reduce poverty and improve
human welfare. Still, government social spending is less
likely to have an impact on aggregate welfare in lowincome countries. One reason is the low quality of public services generally, and consistently low levels of social
spending. Positive effects of aid increases will be enhanced
if backed up by measures to improve state capacity, especially in terms of allocating funds and delivering services
(see chapter 10).

Aid can contribute to poverty reduction and have a positive impact on social sector spending. A recent study62 that
measured changes in government social spending on health,
education and sanitation as a function of variations in aid
ﬂows, tax revenue as a share of GDP, and per capita GDP
over a given period shows that foreign aid, on average, has
a small but signiﬁcant effect on government social spending (1.7 per cent increase for every 10 per cent increase
in aid). However, the effect of increases in tax revenue on
government and social spending is found to be signiﬁcantly
larger, at 3.2 per cent.
Aid has a greater impact on social spending in low-income
countries than in middle-income countries. This is not only
because middle-income countries tend to spend more, on
average, on social services regardless of aid or tax revenues,
but also because aid to middle-income countries is more
likely to go towards investments in infrastructure.

Aid has a small but signiﬁcant
effect on public social spending;
the effect of increases in tax
revenue is signiﬁcantly larger

Perhaps the most striking aspect of
the current global economy is the net
transfer of ﬁnancial resources from
poor countries to rich countries

Finally, aid is important not only in terms of ﬁnancing
social expenditure (and pro-poor economic infrastructure)
in recipient countries, but also as an element of international justice. Enormous global wealth disparities – half
the world’s population have access to just 1 per cent of
the world’s assets – give rise to debates about international
redistribution.
Perhaps the most striking aspect of the current global economy is the net transfer of ﬁnancial resources
from poor countries to rich countries (see table 8.4).
Overall, debt interest payments, investment proﬁt remittances, and the portfolio of central bank reserves offset net
ﬁnancial inﬂows to developing countries. Rich countries,
most notably the United States, are at the receiving end
of the vast majority of global savings, which has been
identiﬁed as one of the main causal factors of the global
economic crisis.

Remittances are a ﬁnancing source for
development and household welfare
If social insurance and pension funds have a clear and direct
link to social policy, remittances arguably stand at the opposite end of the spectrum. Nevertheless, in a context where
global capital ﬂows are increasingly volatile and aid commitments lagging, the steady growth of global remittance ﬂows
has generated optimism in policy circles (see ﬁgure 8.6).

FIGURE 8.6: Annual remittance ﬂows to developing

Remittances are seen as stable, countercyclical development ﬁnance from below, providing foreign exchange at
the macro level and increasing income, consumption and
investment for receiving households at the micro level. Yet
the positive effects of remittances are countered by problems associated with migration, including brain and care
drain, social disintegration and remittance dependency, as
well as the effects of Dutch disease (see box 8.2). Moreover,
the countercyclical nature of remittances does not hold
once home and destination countries are exposed to similar
external shocks, such as the global economic crisis. Questions therefore arise as to the impact remittances have on
the different dimensions of social development, how they
shape patterns of social provisioning and the implications
for social policy.

What has been observed is that remittances are more
important when public social protection programmes are
less developed and welfare provision is largely informal.
Guatemala and Haiti are two low-income countries following a service-led development path, with agriculture
remaining important in terms of employment and livelihoods. Remittance expenditure patterns in these two countries show that households spend a considerable portion of

SECTION TWO – CHAPTER 8 – FINANCING SOCIAL POLICY

transfers from abroad on social services such as health and
education. In Guatemala, for example, households receiving remittances use them to ﬁnance more than half of their
expenditures on health and education.64 However, the
impact on out-of-pocket payments (or insurance contributions) is not the only link between remittances and social
protection. UNRISD research reveals that remittances can
lead to higher tax receipts, which, in turn, contribute to
the ﬁnancing of public policies.65

In Guatemala, households receiving
remittances use them to ﬁnance more
than half of their expenditures on
health and education

International migration generated $5.5 billion in remittances for Viet Nam in 2005, a ﬁgure nearly equal to combined ODA ($3 billion) and foreign direct investment
(FDI) ($3 billion) that year.66 Besides revenues sent by
migrant workers abroad, internal migration, mainly from
the countryside to urban and industrial areas, accounted
for 80 per cent of the transfers received and reported
by Vietnamese households in 2002.67 Remittances in
Viet Nam are considered crucial for reducing poverty and
sustaining livelihoods.
Nevertheless, in the context of the global economic
crisis, remittance ﬂows have decreased considerably
(the World Bank estimates a global decline of 5–8 per cent
in 2009),68 exposing the risks associated with heavy reliance on a development model based on migration.
Admittedly, remittances produce an increase in migrant
households’ monetary income, which can then be spent
for different purposes, including social protection and community projects. However, it is also generally agreed that
remittances, like any other form of private revenue, cannot
substitute for public social policy. They can merely serve to
complement it.

4. Financing Social
Development: Implications
for Policy
UNRISD research has shown that social policies cannot
be divorced from the ﬁnancing structures that underpin
them. Affordability arguments effectively foreclose discussions about the possibility of expanding and diversifying
the existing resource base. Research and policy makers
must begin to explore the complex challenges of mobilizing resources in a way that not only increases ﬁscal space
for social policies, but also reinforces it. The quality (and
not simply the quantity) of ﬁscal resources is important for
creating and strengthening synergistic feedback with social
policy systems.

Create ﬁnancing mechanisms that are
sustainable, equitable and conducive to
economic development
Ideally, revenue and expenditure policies for social provisioning should respond to the principles of efﬁciency, equity
and democratic accountability. They should be embedded
in and support a broader macroeconomic framework that
is conducive to productive investment and employment.
In a nutshell, the challenge is to build social programmes
based on ﬁnancial arrangements that are themselves sustainable in ﬁscal and political terms, equitable and conducive to economic development. This chapter has argued
that domestic ﬁnancing instruments, such as taxation and
social insurance, if well designed, are best suited to create these synergies, to strengthen democracy and social
solidarity, to support a social contract among citizens and
with their political leaders, and to provide the latter with
more policy space. Private and external resources (including mineral rents), although second best from an economic
and equity point of view, have the potential to complement
public domestic ﬁnancing.
Although no clear-cut links can be found between speciﬁc growth patterns, policy regimes and revenue sources,

227

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

high-tax (including social contributions) regimes are
more frequently found in countries following the manufacturing-led growth path. These include East Asian developmental states, former socialist countries in Eastern Europe
and Central Asia and some dualistic states, such as Brazil
and South Africa. Tax shares are usually lower in countries following growth paths led by services, mineral rents
or agriculture.
The composition of revenues is strongly determined by a
country’s level of development and prevailing economic
structures, in particular labour market characteristics.
Economies characterized by high proportions of informality do not perform well in terms of taxation, especially
direct taxes, and few people contribute to social insurance
schemes. Therefore, these countries rely heavily on the
more regressive forms of consumption taxes and user fees
to ﬁnance social protection and social services. External
resources such as aid, remittances or resource rents often ﬁll
in the gaps, but they are also bedevilled with problems of
volatility, conditionality and adverse effects on macroeconomic stability.

The way in which social expenditure is ﬁnanced is not neutral in its distributional or productive effects. Reforms entail
potential losers and winners, which may or may not correspond to groups beneﬁting from public transfer schemes and
social investments. The macroeconomic effects of different
ﬁnancing sources, such as the impact on domestic demand,
investment and savings, monetary stability and currency risks,
have to be considered carefully.70 Similarly, the implementation of progressive direct taxes on wealth and income tends to
create opposition from inﬂuential social groups and can lead
to reform blockades. Therefore, the more universal social programmes are, the easier it is to ﬁnd convincing arguments for
progressive funding structures, which are built on relatively
greater contributions from higher income groups.

programmes are, the easier it is

progressive funding structures

Consider the political and
macroeconomic effects of various
types of ﬁnancing

Anchor a country’s social policy system with
domestic sources of ﬁnancing

Whether improved funding opportunities eventually
increase social expenditures, are channelled into productive investment, pile up in central bank reserves, or reduce
public debt (not to mention corruption and other types
of illegal appropriation of public funds) is a political decision. The more democratic, accountable and transparent
the political process is, the more likely social programmes
and the corresponding budget allocations will reﬂect the
public interest and a reasonable balance between transfers and investment, economic and social spending.
As mentioned earlier, some countries have started to
experiment with alternative budget processes in order
to improve budget analysis and outcomes of ﬁscal policy
for local communities or speciﬁc groups, such as women.
The results are encouraging.69

Like the budget process, ﬁnancing structures are inherently
political. The source of funding has profound implications
for the political economy of building and sustaining social
policies. External sources of funding, in particular ODA,
are only sustainable as long as donor commitments last.
Internal sources, on the other hand, if designed effectively, have the potential to create intergenerational and
interclass linkages that are more difﬁcult to break over
the long term. These domestic ﬁnancing structures are
the core or the anchor of social policy systems. Domestic
ﬁnancing instruments are levied on national economic
activity and they redistribute among different groups.
Macroeconomic policies that foster income creation and
decent, formal employment are therefore the foundation
for any successful ﬁscal strategy.

THE POLITICS OF
POVERTY REDUCTION
Section Three

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

The success of strategies to reduce poverty and inequality hinges on shifts in the relationships
and exercise of power. In recent decades, economic liberalization, democratization and changes
in governance have profoundly altered the relative power and inﬂuence of key actors within
the state, business and civil society. This section shows why patterns of development that
are conducive to poverty reduction require a regulatory and political context characterized by
effective state institutions, social pacts, democratic governance and active citizenship.
The presence, responsibilities and authority of organized business interests have increased
considerably in areas such as regulation and social policy. This enhanced role for business
has occurred to a large extent through corporate social responsibility, private regulation and
public-private partnerships. Such approaches, however, are found wanting from the perspective
of inclusive development and democratic governance. They often ignore key institutional and
political conditions conducive to corporate accountability and the constructive engagement of
business actors in public policy. These conditions include social pacts that encourage business
to support social policies; strong state capacities in areas such as labour regulation; appropriate
norms and laws governing the participation of private interests in public governance; and
institutional mechanisms and forms of collective action for holding corporations accountable
and facilitating redress.
State capacity is crucial for business regulation as well as for the types of structural change and
transformative social policy discussed in previous sections. Strong capacity is associated with
enhanced policy space and political legitimacy, reducing the likelihood of government capture
by powerful groups. Such capacity facilitates the enforcement of rules, and the mobilization and
allocation of resources for development purposes. While authoritarian developmental regimes
have been able to reduce poverty, it has often come at the cost of suppressing civil rights.
Democratic developmental states have been equally successful in reducing poverty where they
have had a broad power base, a coherent bureaucracy, healthy public engagement, and various
commitments and compromises by business. The contemporary focus on good governance and
new public management, however, often ignores such conditions.
Successful poverty reduction requires both that governing elites are committed to changing
power structures in favour of the poor, and that citizens engage in policy-making processes.
Allocative and enforcement capacities, for example, can be improved through citizen participation
in monitoring development agents and service providers. Democracies deliver outcomes that
are beneﬁcial to the poor when groups with strong ties to the poor demonstrate the capacity for
organization and mobilization, transcend or reconcile ethnic, regional and other divisions, and
create links with actors involved in policy making. Electoral processes that can vote parties in
and out of ofﬁce can be conducive to redistribution and progressive reforms, but sustaining such
outcomes requires effective group organization and contestation. Agency and representation
remain key issues in development politics. Poverty reduction is ultimately a question of political
power and active citizenship.

232

CHAPTER

Business, Power and
Poverty Reduction
As the role of the state in key aspects of social policy and
labour market regulation has declined, that of business has
increased. Pro-market ideology and strategies in recent
decades have generated fundamental changes in relations among state, society and business actors. Economic,
regulatory and governance trends that have characterized
globalization and liberalization have not only expanded
commercial opportunities for business enterprises; they
have also drawn them more directly into the arenas of social
policy and poverty reduction. This is particularly apparent
in four areas: the role of business in the privatization of
social services, discussed in chapter 6; the adoption of corporate social responsibility (CSR) principles and practices;
new roles for business organizations in standard setting and
other aspects of business regulation; and the participation
of transnational corporations (TNCs) and business associations in processes of global governance and public policy.
These changes contrast with the traditional role of business in social development. In countries where poverty was
reduced in relatively short periods of time, this role could
vary signiﬁcantly but often featured employment generation, tax payments, philanthropy, corporate social welfare
and insurance obligations, and implicit support for social
policy or a welfare state model.
Today’s world is quite different. The number of TNCs has
vastly increased, as has their economic power through
foreign direct investment (FDI) and global value chains.
Moreover, corporate tax rates have declined sharply over
the past two decades, the percentage of workers covered
by company health plans has decreased in many countries, and social pacts that aligned business interests with
a welfare state model have weakened. At the same time,
international initiatives to control company behaviour
through harder regulations have ceded ground to efforts to
engage the private sector far more directly and proactively

9

in national and international strategies to raise social and
environmental standards and reduce poverty. More and
more companies are associating themselves with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), participating in
public-private partnerships concerned with the provision
of basic services, adopting voluntary initiatives associated
with an expanding CSR agenda, and targeting the world’s
poor in their investment, production and marketing strategies. However, whether or not such approaches enhance
corporate accountability and promote inclusive development remains an open question.
How business relates to poverty and poverty reduction
is complex. Business activities both cause and alleviate
poverty, and poverty generates both costs and beneﬁts
for business. These diverse relationships give rise to varied and often polarized views regarding the new roles that
business actors are assuming in the social and public
arenas. Are such roles effective from the perspective of
inclusive development? Do they do more to legitimize
business-as-usual than enhance well-being? Can organized
business interests play a constructive role in democratic
governance, and if so, under what conditions? This chapter addresses these questions, paying particular attention to
how transnational corporations and business associations
facilitate or constrain poverty reduction via their relationship to public policy and more direct interventions associated with CSR and private standard setting. It draws three
main conclusions.
• The movement towards corporate responsibility
has heightened awareness of how business impacts
development and human rights. But there are
major shortcomings in regulatory and commercial
approaches that aim to enhance the social and
environmental performance of business through
corporate self-regulation, voluntary initiatives and
inclusive business models.

233

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

• Far greater attention must be paid to corporate
accountability, which obliges corporations to
systematically address stakeholder concerns; imposes
some form of penalty on non-compliant ﬁrms; and
enables workers, smallholders, indigenous peoples
and others whose livelihoods and rights have been
negatively affected by business activities to channel
grievances and seek redress.
• The key challenge is to reassert social control over
markets and large corporations via various institutional
arrangements and the reconﬁguration of power
relations. Among other things, this requires new ways
of linking CSR and private regulation with public
policy and law; a strengthening of state regulatory and
inspection capacity; attention to conﬂicts of interest
and responsible lobbying; complaints procedures;
an active role for civil society in advocacy and
social dialogue; and broad-based domestic business
associations and coalitions for progressive social
change. It will also demand an international CSR
agenda that does not shy away from sensitive issues
such as labour rights, corporate lobbying, tax evasion
and avoidance, as well as the social and developmental
effects of the concentration of economic power in
global corporations.
Section 1 of the chapter examines the effectiveness of
recent developments in business practices and international development policy that aim to engage business
more proactively in social development and poverty reduction. The remaining sections examine different dimensions
of business power and inﬂuence, with a view to understanding when business is likely to play a constructive role in
crafting models conducive to inclusive development.
Section 2 looks at the changing nature of state-business
relations.
Section 3 examines the countervailing forces and social pressures associated with civil society and subaltern groups.
Section 4 explores variations in the preferences of different
types of ﬁrms and industries.

Section 5 analyses the role of various types of collaborative
institutions.
In conclusion, section 6 highlights key policy implications
of encouraging greater corporate accountability.

1. The Rhetoric and Reality
of Corporate Responsibility
In the 1980s and 1990s, the rise of FDI and industrial restructuring centred on subcontracting, and the lengthening of
supply chains, rapidly expanded the presence and inﬂuence
of TNCs in developing countries. Although concentrated
in relatively few countries, FDI in developing countries
increased from $7.7 billion in 1980 to over $500 billion in
2007, constituting 27 per cent of global inﬂows.1

The social agenda of business is expanding
In response to mounting concern that globalization and neoliberal policies were generating heavy social costs, and that
TNCs were exacerbating the problem of global injustice, a
worldwide movement emerged that called on ﬁrms to become
more socially responsible.2 CSR embraces the notion that businesses need to consider not only the economic ramiﬁcations
of their activities, but also their social and environmental performance and impacts, wherever they operate in the world.
The movement also called for more constructive engagement
with stakeholders (groups that affect or are affected by business activities). CSR has thus become an umbrella term that
refers to an ever-widening agenda of voluntary initiatives and
various forms of private regulation in which non-state actors
play a key role in setting standards related to the workplace,
the environment and human rights, and promoting or overseeing their implementation. CSR initiatives typically relate
to working conditions, eco-efﬁciency, community support
and anti-corruption. And CSR instruments include codes of
conduct, reporting and disclosure, monitoring, certiﬁcation
and stakeholder dialogues.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 9 – BUSINESS, POWER AND POVERTY REDUCTION

In recent years, the CSR agenda has broadened, moving beyond TNC afﬁliates to their supply chains, beyond
production-based TNCs to the ﬁnancial services industry,
and beyond environment, labour and community issues,

to other dimensions of human rights. It has also embraced
new business models that engage communities and the
poor in commercial activities, as well as myriad forms of
public-private partnerships (see box 9.1).

BOX 9.1: Engaging business in international efforts to reduce poverty
The idea that business in general and TNCs in particular should engage proactively in poverty reduction has been widely supported by
bilateral and international development agencies. Prominent within this agenda are initiatives and approaches aimed at improving the
market climate for the poor; promoting inclusive business models; and mobilizing additional resources for poverty reduction through
philanthropy and partnerships.
Improving the market climate for the poor involves responding to conditions that lead to market failures. These can be related to
property rights, corruption, regulation, information, infrastructure and bargaining power.a Devising inclusive business strategies has
two main objectives: ﬁrst, building new markets that offer products and services adapted to the situation of the poor and that generate
income and employment – for example, providing nutritionally rich yoghurt distributed through community networks. And, second,
improving existing markets by offering better opportunities to entrepreneurs in supply chains and enhancing linkages between
companies and local producers.b Within such strategies, considerable attention has been focused on the potential of the “bottom of the
pyramid” approach, which aims to integrate the poor and the informal sector into the formal economy and value chains as consumers,
producers or employees. According to some estimates, the bottom of the pyramid comprises four billion people.c
Although there is a growing body of best practice examples, the assumption that business can actively promote poverty reduction and
pursue proﬁts through such models is questionable. It runs the risk of ignoring several realities, including:
• the limitations posed by the lack of income among the poor. This means that inclusive business strategies will most likely connect
only with those at the top of the poverty pyramid;
• the constraints imposed on businesses by the environment in which they operate. This limits the extent to which they can pursue
strategies that do not generate high short-term proﬁt projections (see section 2 of this chapter);
• inclusive business models that tend to focus more on engaging the poor as consumers rather than as producers; and
• market-oriented solutions that often ignore the key role of social, redistributive and labour market policies in poverty reduction.
More recently the idea of multinational social business has attracted attention. Deﬁned as a non-loss, non-dividend company dedicated
to achieving a social goal, this type of enterprise upholds the importance of proﬁtability but uses surplus to expand operations while
investors may only recoup what they put in.d As in the case of the Grameen-Danone Foods joint venture in Bangladesh, such initiatives
currently tend to be highly dependent on the idiosyncrasies of individual entrepreneurs. The absence of an enabling institutional
environment raises considerable doubt about the extent to which they can be replicated on a signiﬁcant scale.e
The role of business in social development has been further enhanced by international efforts to cultivate new sources of ﬁnancing
for development. The private sector is being courted as a key source of ﬁnancing for the MDGs.f Philanthropic foundations, such as the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, and public-private partnerships such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization are mobilizing and channelling private sector funding
to various ﬁelds of social development.g Such initiatives have mobilized signiﬁcant resources and resulted in many tangible beneﬁts,
particularly in ﬁelds related to health, agriculture and microﬁnance. But they also raise serious questions about the fragmentation of
health systems, stress on national capacities, conﬂicts of interest and the inﬂuence of private actors in public governance, as well as
the sustainability of such funding sources – not least in the context of the global economic crisis.h

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Consequently, businesses are increasingly expected to move
beyond their conventional role and engage with social and
sustainable development objectives as part of their core
strategies. CSR is often held up as a third way between
heavy-handed government regulation and a market-oriented
approach to development that marginalizes social concerns.
From the perspective of poverty reduction and inclusive
development, how constructive an approach is CSR?
This question has generated much heated debate among
those who lean towards the view that ﬁrms should not be
distracted from their central focus on proﬁt maximization
and responsibilities to shareholders; that smart companies
must manage risk and reputation; that their license to operate implies being responsive to societal concerns and proactive in good governance; and that CSR and public-private
partnerships tend to legitimize big business and facilitate
institutional capture. Such diverse views partly reﬂect
the multiple ways in which business relates to poverty and
poverty reduction (see box 9.2).

Assessments of CSR reveal
major shortcomings
The scope and substance of CSR have developed
considerably in recent years. Over 5,000 businesses,
including one-third of the Fortune 500 companies,
participated in the world’s largest CSR initiative – the
UN Global Compact – in 2009. Business-oriented
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have mobilized
considerable company support for CSR in numerous countries. By mid-2009, for example, nearly 1,400 companies
were members of Instituto Ethos in Brazil, and 300 companies belonged to an organization called Philippines
Business for Social Progress. The business universe,
however, is vast. Transnational corporations alone number
82,000, and their 810,000 afﬁliates source from millions of
suppliers.3 As can be seen in table 9.1, the number of enterprises participating in some of the high-proﬁle international and sectoral CSR initiatives still represents a small
fraction of this universe.

BOX 9.2: Business, poverty and poverty reduction – A complex relationship
How business relates to poverty and poverty reduction is complex. In some circumstances, business activities and the power of certain
business interests can be seen as cause of poverty. Power asymmetries in trade relations, competitive pressures in global value chains
and skewed business-labour relations, for example, can result in small agricultural producers and low-skilled workers receiving
prices or wages that fuel absolute or relative poverty and indecent work. The benign-sounding term externalities is used to refer to
the fact that economic activities can have spillover effects on third parties that are not compensated. But such language can mask
the human consequences of situations where oil, mining, agribusiness and many other business activities pollute the environment,
damage people’s health and dislocate livelihoods and communities. Tax avoidance and evasion deprive governments of the revenues
needed for social and other expenditures associated with poverty reduction, while bribery and lobbying can undermine governance
for the public good.
Business itself may be negatively affected by poverty, when, for example, poverty reduces the size of consumer markets, diminishes
the pool of healthy and educated workers, or undermines the stability of a particular country or region. Business can also be a
fundamental part of the solution to poverty by generating employment, lowering prices through competition, facilitating access to
basic goods and services, and stimulating economic activity through linkages with micro- and small enterprises. It can promote
corporate social welfare and social responsibility, engage in philanthropy, support progressive social policies and provide much
needed expertise, taxes and royalties to governments.a

While thousands of enterprises
participate in CSR initiatives,
this represents a small fraction
of the business universe
Despite the increasing popularity of CSR within business circles and the international development community more generally, there is surprisingly little systematic
research into what it has achieved.4 Attention has focused

primarily on understanding how CSR affects business – in
particular ﬁnancial – performance. But even this analysis
is inconclusive, relying heavily on case studies and using
varied and often poor methodologies that tend to provide
snapshots that say more about inputs and outputs than outcomes and change.
Research is beginning to raise awareness that the impact of
CSR cannot be taken for granted. One of the few comprehensive assessments of a large CSR effort is that of the UK –
based Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), which promotes
CSR in global value chains of mainly large supermarket

237

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

groups, agrifood or clothing companies. The study found
some improvements related to overtime, occupational
health and safety, and compliance with minimum wage
legislation, but considerable neglect of labour rights related
to collective bargaining and freedom of association.5

Pros and cons of the human rights agenda
The recent attention to human rights as another pillar of
CSR, particularly through the work of the UN SecretaryGeneral’s Special Representative on business and human
rights, appointed in 2005, is potentially a signiﬁcant development from the perspective of poverty reduction. While
concerns persist about the voluntary nature of many of the
proposals, the framework not only recognizes the multiple
dimensions of poverty (economic, social and cultural), but
also suggests the need for companies to address CSR more
systematically, rather than in an ad hoc manner. The evidence shows, however, that the way powerful actors and
institutions choose to apply and interpret a rights-based
discourse can be problematic.
Mining companies and international ﬁnancial institutions
(IFIs), for example, are now paying more attention to issues
of indigenous rights. They have developed a variety of voluntary standards and other initiatives to address the negative impact of natural resource extraction on the livelihood,
identity and environment of indigenous peoples. UNRISD
studies in Australia, Cameroon, Chad, India, Nigeria, Peru
and the Philippines show, however, that TNCs, IFIs and
governments often adopt particular meanings of indigenous
rights. These interpretations may, in fact, serve to divide
indigenous communities and co-opt indigenous leaders or
groups in ways that align indigenous interests with those of
state and corporate agendas.6

When corporate policies and practices
work against inclusivity
Research in recent years has also focused on the limitations
of CSR that relate to the structural context in which ﬁrms
operate and the nature of power relations. The CSR agenda
has some major blind spots and in some contexts may have
contradictory effects from the perspective of inclusive
development. Of particular concern are situations where:

238

• CSR enhances the inﬂuence of big business in global
governance and public policy;
• trade unions and industrial relations institutions,
as well as Southern stakeholders, are marginalized
in CSR processes;
• the CSR agenda ignores issues of corporate power
and unequal power relations within value chains
and partnerships;
• so-called policing approaches are used by large
corporations to raise standards in supply chains;
• CSR co-exists with the tendency to transfer risks
and costs down the supply chain, often forcing suppliers
to cut costs and undermining their ability to raise
labour standards;
• increased wages constrain employment generation and
add to the pool of factors encouraging ﬁrms to relocate;7
• there is a gulf between the CSR discourse of global
corporations and business associations and their
lobbying and ﬁscal practices; and
• so-called shareholder primacy – the notion that
shareholder interests are prioritized in corporate
decision making – and the way companies relate to the
ﬁnancial system encourages managers to focus narrowly
on short-term ﬁnancial results.

CSR varies by region, industry and ﬁrm
Despite the global presence of many TNCs, they are still
strongly inﬂuenced by the institutional context and regulatory frameworks of both home and host countries. The
responsiveness of ﬁrms to stakeholder or societal concerns
is also shaped by the variations that exist in the preferences of particular ﬁrms and sectors, the nature of relations
between ﬁrms and the relative weight of markets or states
in coordinating such relations.

Four distinct approaches
An analysis of a large number of corporate policies, commitments and initiatives referred to on company websites and
in reports that relate to CSR and poverty reduction reveals
four different approaches among the world’s top 100 corporations and signiﬁcant variations by region and sector.8

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 9 – BUSINESS, POWER AND POVERTY REDUCTION

• Inactive: companies make no explicit commitments to
poverty reduction or CSR.
• Reactive: companies engage defensively with CSR and
modestly support certain CSR initiatives.
• Active: companies adopt a variety of CSR practices
and acknowledge the problem of poverty.
• Proactive: companies systematically and proactively
apply a broad range of CSR and corporate
accountability measures, promote inclusive business
models and explicitly support the MDGs.
Furthermore, a tally of whether companies are engaging
with the myriad CSR standards and instruments that now
exist also reveals the tendency for companies to adopt a
fragmented approach. They are active in some areas, but
far less so in others. This might be expected in situations
where companies begin to engage with CSR, or if they

adhere too strictly to the mantra that CSR needs to be tied
to core business strategies.9 But it contradicts the principle that companies that are serious about CSR should be
applying ethical principles more systematically rather than
picking and choosing.
Table 9.2 suggests that the largest European corporations
lean towards a more active response to CSR than East
Asian corporations, although the latter are also noted for
more traditional corporate social welfare beneﬁts (at least
in their home countries) rather than contemporary CSR
initiatives. The biggest corporations in the United States
are somewhere in between those of Europe and Asia, with a
strong inclination towards inactive and reactive approaches.
The largest corporations in Latin America, which are statecontrolled corporations in the energy industry, have tended
to adopt a fairly reactive approach.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Variations in CSR by industry
Responses to CSR also vary signiﬁcantly by industry and ﬁrm,
given the variations in business preferences, social pressure,
the regulatory environment and the speciﬁc history and culture of each company, as well as how these elements interact.10
Sectoral variations related to the world’s largest corporations are indicated in table 9.2. The response of the petroleum reﬁning sector partly reﬂects the fact that high-proﬁle
companies such as BP and Shell periodically ﬁnd themselves
in the sights of activists, the media and regulators for environmental, health and safety and other violations, and need
to take action to protect their brand value and reputation.
Companies in other sectors targeted by activists often reveal
similar responses: for example, Rio Tinto in mining, Nike in
sports footwear, Gap in apparel and Nestlé in food processing.
Through time such companies have engaged with a broader
range of CSR issues. Others, such as ExxonMobil and WalMart, have remained more selective, a fact that reafﬁrms the
relevance of corporate culture as an element that explains the
uptake and trajectory of CSR. For companies such as Danone
and Unilever, which have a longer social trajectory of one
form or another, the jump from business-as-usual to CSR may
not seem particularly challenging. This helps to explain not
only variations in levels of company engagement with CSR
in general, but also the aspects of CSR that are emphasized
by corporate management. Norms related to labour rights, for
example, tend to be fairly well embedded in European companies, which have a long history of engagement with governments and trade unions promoting labour rights, at least in
their home countries.

Attention should refocus
on corporate accountability
The above discussion suggests the need to rethink the role
of business in social development and poverty reduction
that has been promoted in mainstream international development circles. Two strands of analysis are particularly useful in this regard.
First, a growing recognition of the limits of CSR and the need
for alternative approaches has led many observers to focus

240

on ways and means of enhancing corporate accountability.
The term refers to institutional arrangements that go beyond
corporate self-regulation and voluntary initiatives and oblige
corporations to answer to their stakeholders, incur some sort
of penalty in cases of non-compliance with agreed standards,
and provide mechanisms for those whose rights and livelihoods have been negatively affected to channel grievances
and seek redress.11 Whether or not business adopts a meaningful and proactive approach to CSR and is accountable
depends to a large extent on the institutional and political
settings in which ﬁrms operate. Proactivity and accountability require a context in which law, public policy, voluntary
approaches, social pressures, critical thinking and learning
about best practices combine in ways that are complementary
and reinforce each other in positive ways.12

Growing recognition of the limits of
CSR has led many observers to focus
on ways and means of enhancing
corporate accountability
Second, if, as argued throughout this report, macroeconomic,
social and other public policies are key for development, then
it is crucial to examine how business interests inﬂuence the
design, substance and implementation of public policies.13 A
useful starting point is to consider how business has behaved
in societies or varieties of capitalism (that is, the different
ways ﬁrms use market and non-market institutions to coordinate their activities in different spheres of the political
economy) that managed to reduce poverty in relatively short
periods of time. In East Asia, the Nordic countries and the
United States during the New Deal era, some or all of the
following conditions or drivers were particularly relevant.14
• Certain types of state-business relations: states had
signiﬁcant administrative capacity, regulatory authority
and developmental vision to provide the incentives
and controls needed to enhance competitiveness,
contain negative externalities and social conﬂict, and
craft social pacts that reduced business opposition to
redistributive policies.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 9 – BUSINESS, POWER AND POVERTY REDUCTION

• Both states and businesses needed to minimize the
disruptive inﬂuences or potential threats associated
with social pressures, notably labour unrest.
• Certain ﬁrms and industries supported social
policy for reasons related to business preferences
or strategy: ﬁrms dependent on skilled workers, for
example, needed a well-educated pool from which
to draw labour.
• Certain forms of collaborative institutions conducive to
social dialogue and bargaining, as well as the presence
of broad-based business associations representing
large, medium and small enterprises from multiple
sectors, played a role in fostering business positions
more supportive of progressive public policy. Such
associations were more likely to speak for the wider
business community than for corporate elites and
special interests.

between business and politicians, bureaucrats and political
parties as well as myriad social, professional and institutional relations further bind states and business interests.
These mechanisms can vary signiﬁcantly by country and
varieties of capitalism, as well as across time.

Although based on an observation of today’s richer countries, the above analysis is relevant for understanding when
business might support labour market and social policies
that are conducive to inclusive development. The following sections examine the changing nature of these conditions in the context of liberalization, and how they vary
under different development paths and policy regimes.

Globalization and liberalization have
profoundly altered power relations

2. Changes and Variations in
State-Business Relations
Powerful ties between political and business elites often
ensure that states prioritize the preferences of organized
business interests. In developing countries, media and
international attention have focused to a large extent
on corruption and crony capitalism. In practice, business
power and inﬂuence come in many guises. The so-called
structural power of capital is a crucial dimension of business inﬂuence. States typically seek to achieve high rates of
growth in the interests of modernization, to attract private
investment, and to secure the ﬁscal revenues on which the
state depends. Lobbying, legal and illegal ﬁnancial ﬂows

From the perspective of social development, four major
constraints follow from these relations. First, they favour
patterns of resource allocation guided by particular as
opposed to public interests. Second, they can reinforce
macroeconomic policies that, as was seen in Section one
of this report, can have perverse social and developmental implications. Third, they often impose major limits on
the scope for redistributive policy. And fourth, social policy
may be designed and rights-based laws enacted, but implementation and enforcement lag far behind.

Important shifts in the balance of power and regulatory
authority have occurred with globalization and liberalization.
• The structural power of some sectors of business
has increased, particularly in developing country
contexts where government technocrats see FDI as
the key to development and are fearful of capital ﬂight
or capital strikes. Often, their assumptions about what
business wants relate more to the interests of TNCs and
foreign investors than the broader business community,
which includes domestic capital and small- and
medium-sized enterprises.15
• The instrumental power of business to mobilize
material resources and social capital to inﬂuence
the policy process through both formal and
informal channels has also increased. Important
in this regard is the capacity of corporations and
business associations to lobby decision makers and
the increasing needs of policy makers for technical
knowledge, which has facilitated business
participation in consultative processes.

241

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

• The discursive power of business elites has expanded.16
This is reﬂected in the use of buzzwords and narratives
that serve to frame knowledge and policy agendas and
debates,17 and demonstrate that corporations are now
“partners” – part of the solution and not simply part of
the problem.18
• There has been a vast increase in non-equity forms
of TNC activity associated, for example, with
subcontracting, franchising and certain forms of
public-private partnerships that have major
implications for the distribution of responsibility,
risk and costs within value chains.19
• New powerful business actors from emerging market
economies are increasing their global reach. They
are often not exposed to the same pressures that have
forced some Northern corporations to review their
social, environmental and human rights performance.
• Privatization in developing and transitional economies
has not only increased corporate control of key sectors
and services, it has also resulted in reduced levels
of corporate social welfare that had previously been
provided by state enterprises.
• A “new constitutionalism” has arisen in which corporate
rights have been locked in via a body of international
and national law20 concerned with property rights
and an enabling environment for TNCs and foreign
investors in developing countries, which is also part
of the good governance agenda (see chapter 10).
The strengthening of corporate rights has produced
a growing imbalance between corporate rights and
obligations, particularly in developing countries,21
which the CSR movement is seeking to address.
• State capacity in key areas of government has declined,
particularly in developing countries undergoing
structural adjustment (see chapter 10). This has
affected not only aspects of business regulation such as
labour inspection, but also policy space or the capacity
of developing country governments to resort to a range

242

of policy instruments and approaches. Furthermore,
regulatory authority has increasingly been assumed
by non-state actors, including corporations and
business associations, which set standards and oversee
their implementation.22
• Democratization affects business-state relations
in complex ways: electoral competition and other
democratic institutions may favour more pluralistic
models of governance and provide space for
countervailing social forces. But democracy can
also present numerous opportunities for business
elites and corporations to lobby, buy inﬂuence and
take up inﬂuential positions in political parties and
executive ofﬁce.

The inﬂuence of business varies
by industry and policy regime
As a result of these developments, the degree of autonomy
that technocracies in some developmental states enjoyed
in crafting national development strategies has often been
reduced. But it is misleading to overgeneralize about the
rise of corporate power vis-à-vis states. Transnational corporations do not always have superior bargaining power.
Depending on the industry and policy regime in question,
such power may vary considerably, ranging from very high,
in the case of a company like Nike investing in a shoe production site, to very low, as in the case of automobile TNCs
in China.23 The relative power of state and business interests associated with FDI depends partly on the nature of
the investment involved. Investments that are seeking low
labour costs, as in the case of apparel and textile companies
in Bangladesh, Honduras and Tunisia, can shift location
relatively easily, giving companies more bargaining power.
In contexts where investment occurs as part of a search for
resources, such as mining companies in Chile or Peru, or
for new or bigger markets, as in Brazil, China and India,
national governments may have more leverage.24
While the dominant change in development policy and
ideology that has occurred since the 1980s is often described

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 9 – BUSINESS, POWER AND POVERTY REDUCTION

as neoliberal, this obscures signiﬁcant variations in approach
and practice.25 Both China and Viet Nam, for example, vigorously entered the international trade regime, but retained
important elements of the traditional developmental state.
In more established democracies, such as Costa Rica and
India, governments of different political persuasions have
promoted economic liberalization, but electoral competition and a vibrant civil society have imposed certain limits
on the extent to which government policy can liberalize
and prioritize business interests.26

The bargaining power of transnational
corporations may range from almost
absolute to close to zero, depending on
the industry and policy regime

organizations lobby government and parliament. Interests
associated with domestic and transnational capital have
been particularly adept at taking advantage of this shift.
During the initial period of liberalization in the 1980s,
when there was a large and sudden ﬂow of FDI into Brazil,
some sectors of domestic capital were adversely affected.
This led to a major organizational effort on the part of certain business associations to strengthen their inﬂuence in
the policy and legislative process, in an attempt to inﬂuence trade policy negotiations and ensure that labour and
other aspects of the “Brazil cost” of doing business were
reduced in order to enhance international competitiveness.29 In both Brazil and South Africa, pro-business gains
that derive from economic liberalization have been moderated to some extent by institutional and political developments associated with social dialogue and democratization,
which have facilitated civil society advocacy and given
voice to a recently enfranchised citizenry (see chapter 11).

In more established democracies
In newly democratic states
In new democracies, even governments controlled by
political parties with Leftist credentials often pursue a neoliberal agenda.27 In South Africa, both the structural and
instrumental power of business have increased through
competitive pressures related to trade and investment,
perceptions of impending economic crisis, the strength of
both home-grown and foreign TNCs and certain sectoral
business associations, as well as the rise of a black capitalist class. The close relationship between big business interests and the technocracy played a part in the shift from
a more redistributive to a more business-friendly development strategy in 1996. A key dimension of big business
inﬂuence related to the easy access of the business elite to
senior policy makers through formal and informal consultative processes. The instrumental power of business further
increased in the past decade with Black Economic Empowerment, which expanded and consolidated a black business
elite that enjoyed close personal and political ties to the
African National Congress (ANC).28
Brazil has experienced a partial shift from a corporatist to a
more pluralistic model, where a diverse range of actors and

In more established democracies such as Costa Rica and
India, governments of different political persuasions have
promoted economic liberalization. But a number of countervailing forces exist. As noted in chapter 11, political
parties that have to compete in elections and alternate in
power are likely to confront certain pressures that limit
the pace and extent of liberalization and their willingness
to prioritize certain business interests. And such democracies may also have a well-organized and vibrant civil society
that includes trade unions, NGOs and social movements
engaged in contestation, advocacy and social dialogue
calling for business regulation and more inclusive patterns
of development.30

In more fragile democracies and clientelistic states
In more fragile democracies and clientelistic states experiencing neoliberal reform, state-business relations often
evolved in ways that had little to do with the textbook
theory of structural adjustment. In Kenya, a fragmented
business sector was not only vulnerable to international
competition, but also marginalized in formal consultative processes associated with public policy. Transnational
corporations increased their presence in the country,

243

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

but often had to collude with public ofﬁcials who had a
stake in companies that established linkages with TNCs.31
Indeed, close ties between the upper echelons of the civil
service and business, which had been legitimized by a 1970s
ruling that allowed civil servants to have business interests,
fuelled conﬂicts of interest and underpinned corruption.
As noted in chapter 10, corruption often increased in countries undergoing structural adjustment due to the decline in
the real incomes of civil servants.

growth. In this region, however, corruption has also led to
periodic crises, given the inability of governments to adopt
timely regulatory and interventionist policies.35

Similarly, in Peru, rapid privatization increased the power
and inﬂuence of a group of large, mainly foreign, corporations. Such business interests became highly inﬂuential in
shaping political appointments in key centres of economic
policy making. Furthermore, the use of a “revolving door”
mechanism acted as an effective transmission belt between
some sectors of business and the state technocracy. Bribery
also ensured that some media companies became part of
a process that legitimized corrupt practices linked to privatization, provided generous tax beneﬁts and exoneration
to companies, and condoned the use of repression, which
stiﬂed civil society activism.32

tension and conﬂict, and a fall in
private sector resources
Corruption and economic development
But state capture and corruption are global phenomena:
indeed, if public opinion is any guide, problems of bribery
appear to be as prevalent in advanced industrialized countries as they are in developing ones (see ﬁgure 9.1). How corruption relates to economic development is a complex issue.
The effects are often unequivocally perverse, for example,
when bribery results in ﬁscal losses, generates tensions and
conﬂict within the state and between the state and civil society, and prevents business collective action,33 or when largescale corruption pumps resources out of the private sector.34
In some contexts, as in East Asia, corruption may be widespread, but both the state and political parties tend to support a pattern of private sector development that facilitates

3. How Social Pressure Can
Affect Corporate Behaviour
The above section describes how state-business relations
often tend towards policy environments that favour investment and growth at the expense of redistribution and
transformative social policy. They can also impede the
effective implementation and enforcement of progressive
laws and regulations. What conditions must exist, therefore, to promote more inclusive models of development and
social policy? A large body of political economy analysis
and so-called power resource theory emphasizes the need
for changes in the conﬁguration of organized interests and
the strengthening of coalitions of multiple actors, including political parties and subaltern social groups. How such
conditions relate to development strategies and policies
conducive to poverty reduction is discussed in chapter 11.
This section examines how such pressures affect corporate
accountability and business regulation.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 9 – BUSINESS, POWER AND POVERTY REDUCTION

The nature of social pressure associated with business
behaviour and regulation has changed considerably in
recent decades.
• The power and inﬂuence of traditional social
movements associated with labour and small farmers
have weakened in many countries.
• Civil society activism concerned with different
dimensions of global justice has expanded rapidly.
• Large corporations, in particular high-proﬁle brandname companies concerned with product and company
image, have been targeted by civil society campaigns.
• NGOs have been particularly active in this ﬁeld,
and have adopted numerous tactics and relationships
with corporations that include naming and shaming,
the provision of services paid for by corporations,
participation in stakeholder dialogues, boycotts of
companies and products, and the ranking of companies
in particular sectors.

In contrast to the mainstream CSR
agenda, the corporate accountability
movement has redirected attention to
issues of power, law and public policy

In contrast to the mainstream CSR agenda, which is concerned primarily with promoting voluntary initiatives
and private standard setting, the corporate accountability movement36 has redirected attention to a multitude
of issues. These include questions related to industrial
relations, labour rights, the role of public policy in business regulation, the synergistic relationship between voluntary initiatives and the law (where, for example, norms
associated with voluntary codes of conduct are adopted as
benchmarks in national law), the imposition of penalties
in cases of non-compliance with agreed standards, institutional capture and perverse forms of lobbying by business
interests, the right of victims to seek redress, the empowerment of weaker groups in society through organization and

mobilization, and imbalances in power relations in governance institutions and value chains.

Labour movements are showing
signs of revival
There are also some signs of a revival of the labour movement. In a number of countries, trade unions are attempting
to reverse the decline in union density and societal inﬂuence by reaching out, for example, to women and informal
sector workers, as well as to other civil society organizations.37 They also appear to be reasserting their authority
and inﬂuence in initiatives and processes involving dialogue, bargaining and contestation that aim to improve
the social, environmental and human rights performance
of global corporations. This is apparent in some of the new
democracies, such as Brazil and South Africa, where institutions of social dialogue have been strengthened.
In numerous countries with large or growing informal sectors, such as Mexico, Nicaragua and Peru in Latin America, India and the Philippines in Asia, and Kenya, South
Africa and Zambia in Africa, informal or own-account
workers are organizing nationally and associating internationally through organizations such as StreetNet International, which was launched in 2002. Women workers, often
marginalized in male-dominated trade union structures, are
either participating to greater effect or forming other organizations, such as the Self-Employed Women’s Association
(SEWA) in India. While freedom of association is restricted
in China, workers have increasingly been mobilizing for better labour standards through various forms of struggle and
grassroots strategies, as well as some small unionizing efforts
outside the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.38
Trade unions and other labour rights organizations are
becoming more assertive in the ﬁeld of CSR, moving from
more defensive to more proactive engagement with various
multistakeholder initiatives. Furthermore, issues of concern
to unions are broadening beyond the workplace: they are
now collaborating with broader civil society movements
for policy reform and social change.

245

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Trade unions and other labour rights
organizations are becoming more
assertive in the ﬁeld of CSR
Activism is becoming more cohesive
NGOs, and networks of NGOs and other groups, have generally had more success in getting companies to commit to
certain standards than in holding them to account for delivering them.39 Whereas there was considerable cohesiveness
within the labour movement historically, contemporary
civil society activism has often been highly fragmented
and dispersed in terms of issues, actions and inﬂuence.
More recent developments associated with the emergence
of transnational activist networks and the global justice40
and corporate accountability movements suggest that some
of the weaknesses of activism are being addressed. Such
movements have brought together NGOs, trade unions
and grassroots organizations from both North and South,
which are integrating national, regional and transnational
networks in campaigns, for example, to defend workers’
rights in El Salvador and Mexico,41 indigenous peoples
in Colombia and Peru affected by the activities of oil and
mining companies,42 and to agitate against child labour.43
Networking is proving to be a powerful tool for activism
concerned with global justice and corporate accountability. However, ongoing hierarchies, ideological differences
and turf battles within civil society, as well as resource
constraints, mean that the potential of such new modes of
collective action are still far from being realized.44
Another development is the rise of activism on a scale
commensurate with economic systems and institutions of
governance that require change.45 Given the extent to
which global rules and powerful transnational actors and
institutions currently affect domestic policy and development processes, it is crucial to organize at the global level.46
Mobilization at the transnational level and the consolidation of transnational activist networks that connect the
global and local scales not only strengthen contestation in

246

key international and national decision-making arenas, but
also give disadvantaged groups leverage in local struggles.47
Particularly relevant in this regard are the struggles of
indigenous peoples affected by mining and oil extraction,
for example, through the Camisea natural gas project in
Peru, Vedanta’s operations in India, Occidental Petroleum
in Colombia and Shell in the Niger Delta. A key point
here is not simply that activism is connecting at multiple
levels, but that it is adapting to changes in governance systems that have seen the national stage lose some ground to
local, regional and international levels.
Another challenge confronting activists concerns the
ability of mobile capital to relocate if social pressures and
economic costs increase in a particular country. As in the
case of the Asia Floor Wage Campaign, which coordinates
action to improve wages in the garment industry in several countries, this calls for organizing on a regional scale.
Adaptation is also apparent in relation to the emergence
of a broader portfolio of action. The earlier discussion of
the need for law, public policy, voluntary initiatives, naming and shaming and other sorts of contestation suggests
that activism must engage with multiple institutional and
political arenas, and adopt multiple strategies and tactics.

The nature of social activism varies
by policy regime
In countries with authoritarian structures, such as China,
where independent trade union organizing and the NGO
advocacy community are weak, transnational activist networks can play an important role in spearheading improvements in corporate social and environmental performance.
They do so by exerting direct pressure on both TNCs with
interests in the host economy and the governments of
countries that are trading partners. Such activism complements the spontaneous actions of Chinese migrant, state
and other workers concerned with the abuse of labour rights
and poor working conditions – actions that have escalated
sharply since the mid-1990s.48 Developmental states prioritize economic development, but must also ensure social
stability. While authoritarian means may be employed,

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 9 – BUSINESS, POWER AND POVERTY REDUCTION

such regimes also use social and labour market policy, as
occurred recently in China with the Labour Contract Law
of January 2008. The law, which obligates ﬁrms to establish
and enforce employment contracts, was introduced despite
the concerns of some organized business interests that it
would generate costly rigidities that would drive away foreign investment. They lobbied during the consultation
period for less intervention in probationary periods and
corporate autonomy in deciding employment codes.49
In some new democracies, such as Brazil and South Africa,
the issue of corporate accountability has achieved a higher
proﬁle in public debate and policy circles.50 This is the
result of a combination of factors, including the presence
of a vibrant NGO community, a revitalized trade union
movement, and linkages with transnational activist networks concerned with a variety of global justice issues.
In more established electoral democracies such as India,
civil society activism often evokes substantive responses
from political leaders. The tactics may vary considerably,
ranging from media-savvy and technically grounded advocacy, as employed, for example, by the Centre for Science
and Environment, to grassroots protests. One such event,
involving 25,000 people, was a month-long march organized by Ekta Parishad in 2007. The protest pressured the
government to take action to address the abuse of the land
rights and the threats to the livelihoods of tribal peoples
and small farmers linked to the activities of corporations,
state institutions and infrastructure projects. The 2005
Right to Information Act and Public Interest Litigation
have also been used to seek redress.
The relative importance of transnational activism, organizations and networks is also apparent in fragile democracies
such as Kenya. Here, sectors of agribusiness, in particular
horticulture, have expanded rapidly in the absence of an
effective regulatory environment or trade union representation. International civil society campaigns and organizations, such as the ETI, International Union of Food
Workers, and Women Working Worldwide have played a
role in improving working conditions for women and casual workers within global commodity chains such as those
selling cut ﬂowers.51

4. Business Preferences
Relating to Social and
Labour Market Policy
The sections above have focused on power relations and
the correlation of social forces. Such analysis is crucial for
explaining how business interests relate to and inﬂuence
public policy in general and macroeconomic and social policy in particular. It runs the risk, however, of generalizing
excessively about business preferences that relate to social
and labour market policy. These can vary signiﬁcantly by
ﬁrm, industry, region and the variety of capitalism that may
be operating. Firms and industries dependent on skilled
labour, for example, may be more inclined to accommodate
public policies supporting education and training. This
was a feature of the East Asian model referred to earlier.
Under the import-substitution model of industrialization
in Latin America (see chapter 1), which protected domestic business from international competition, ﬁrms could
more easily accommodate welfare beneﬁts for formal sector workers.52 How ﬁrms position themselves in relation to
minimum wage policy may also vary depending on levels of
competition and the composition of their workforce.

Business preferences have
changed under globalization
Business preferences have changed signiﬁcantly in the
context of globalization and liberalization. Financialization, industrial concentration and the growing inﬂuence of
TNCs in global value chains have changed the scope for
businesses to pursue strategies that enhance employment.

Financialization and transnational capital
Financialization (that is, the growing share of ﬁnance in
economies and the greater application of ﬁnancial logic
to economic and social spheres) has reinforced short-term
proﬁtability as a key criterion for evaluating corporate performance.53 This marks a signiﬁcant departure from earlier periods or varieties of capitalism in which proﬁts were
reinvested into the company, and managers took a longer

247

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

term view of corporate performance. Not surprisingly, such
developments coincide with a marginalization of occupational welfare stemming from pressures to improve shareholder value54 and a stagnation in productive investment
and employment growth.55 Recent decades have witnessed a
large expansion in the number of TNCs and their afﬁliates.
The number of TNCs increased from some 35,000 in 1990
to 82,000 in recent years, while their afﬁliates expanded
more than ﬁve-fold over the same period.56 Compared to
the global economic presence of TNCs, employment in
afﬁliates is relatively small. TNCs account for approximately
10 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) and
one-third of its exports, but less than 3 per cent of the global
workforce.57 The shift from so-called greenﬁeld investment
– that is, investment in new assets – to mergers and acquisitions has reduced the rate of employment generation associated with FDI.58 Nevertheless, TNC employment increased
fourfold since 1982, reaching 77 million in 2008.59

Industrial concentration and restructuring
At the same time, the global business environment has
seen an unprecedented degree of industrial concentration
by a handful of ﬁrms in numerous sectors (see box 9.3).
This has come about through a continuous focus on core
competencies, while at the same time engaging in complex
value chains through which big manufacturers and retailers
control the costs and quality of their inputs and products.60
What has been called the cascade effect has been noted in
various global value chains, where concentration not only
takes place at the level of the dominant corporations or systems integrators, but also occurs within different tiers of the
chain, often crowding out smaller enterprises.61 The effect
is particularly noticeable within some agricultural sectors
where the smallholders that survive often have little choice
but to receive low prices and incur additional costs to comply with quality standards.62

BOX 9.3: Corporate concentration
The share of the global market held by the top 10
corporations:

• Pharmaceuticals: 55%
• Seeds (proprietary): 67%
• Food and beverage processors: 26%
• Agrochemicals: 89%
• Biotechnology: 66%
Source: ETC Group 2008.

Labour standards in supply chains
As global value chains expanded, many developing countries broadened their participation in the international
division of labour, supplying raw materials and cheap
manufactures produced by low-skilled and low-paid workers.63 Kenya, for example, has rapidly expanded production
of non-traditional agro-exports such as vegetables, fruit
and cut ﬂowers, becoming one of the largest exporters of
vegetables to the European Union in the 1990s. There is
some evidence that this may have contributed positively
to poverty reduction via employment. But poor labour
standards characterize this sector, which relies heavily on
part-time, casual and female labour and the extensive use
of pesticides.64 Working conditions in afﬁliates of TNCs
are often better than in local ﬁrms. Nevertheless, TNCs in
various sectors are reducing the proportion of permanent
labour employed in core enterprises and relying more on
subcontracting and casual labour where conditions related
to monetary wages, overtime, social entitlements, occupational health and safety, and respect for labour rights are
often worse.

Cultural rights and livelihood security

TNCs account for 10 per cent of
the world’s GDP and one-third of
its exports, but less than 3 per cent
of the global workforce

248

In addition to the question of labour standards in the supply chain, it is important to consider other human rights
dimensions, including cultural rights. There is far more to
poverty reduction than increasing incomes and employment. What is sometimes referred to as the corporatization

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 9 – BUSINESS, POWER AND POVERTY REDUCTION

of development has, in many countries, led to the largescale displacement of indigenous peoples, farmers and others from their land, seriously disrupted livelihood systems
and food security, and ruptured communities and families
through migration to cities and abroad. In countries such
as India and Mexico, the speed of liberalization and corporatization has had dramatic effects, particularly on rural
communities. Recognition of the dire social effects of such
patterns of development is often muted in both international development and CSR discourse, or assumed to be an
unfortunate side effect of a necessary development path.

Business interests conducive to CSR
and social policy
Industrial concentration and restructuring involving global
value chains, as well as economic restructuring involving
service-led growth can alter business preferences in ways
that are conducive to some aspects of CSR and social policy. Concentration and the rise of both global value chains
and intangible assets, notably brands, has cultivated preferences for CSR as companies seek to ward off reputational
threats and transfer costs and risks down the supply chain
by imposing standards. In some developing countries,
including Costa Rica and India, dynamic growth sectors
centred on information and communications technology
have emerged. This has resulted in the increasing inﬂuence
of business sectors that have an interest in some aspects of
labour market and social policies that prioritize education
and training.
There are various contexts in which theory suggests that
business interests might oppose social regulation, but where,
in practice, the response has been more accommodating.
This has been the case in some regional trade agreements
involving Latin American countries, the United States and
the European Union. In Chile and Nicaragua, for example,
business associations have accepted labour and environmental regulations in return for market access; they have
also accepted that standards that were not seen as particularly onerous were locked in via such agreements.65 Other
research on how business interests relate to social policy
in Latin America shows that, on balance, business has
not been particularly proactive in the social policy arena.

This has sometimes been due to the limited presence of
broad-based business associations – those most likely to
articulate demands for social policy. It can also be attributed to the difﬁculties of engaging in social policy processes
that are often protracted and where the costs and beneﬁts
of such policies are not always clear, and where the types of
ﬁrms and informal labour markets that predominate in the
region give rise to a relatively low preference for education
and training.66

Embedding business in society
Whether business elites contribute proactively to inclusive development through ﬁscal and social responsibility
depends to some extent on their embeddedness in social
networks. This level can vary signiﬁcantly, not only by the
society in which businesses are operating and the corporate culture, but also by the value chain. At one extreme,
for example, are low-value-export manufacturing plants or
maquilas in the apparel sector, which are attracted by low
wages and relief from ﬁscal and labour obligations, develop
relatively few linkages with the local economy and often
have a short-term investment horizon. Mining companies
often ﬁnd themselves in a hybrid situation, adopting a
long-term horizon but relatively few linkages due to their
enclave character.67

Mainstream literature on CSR often
ignores the contribution of smalland medium-sized enterprises that
are embedded in local societies

These situations contrast, say, with those of companies
producing food and household products for the domestic
market. An in-depth study of the contribution of UnileverIndonesia to poverty reduction in that country notes multiple linkages and ﬁscal and ﬁnancial ﬂows conducive to
inclusive development. However, trends associated with
subcontracting and net ﬁnancial outﬂows from the country

249

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

were of concern.68 In countries such as Guatemala and
Kenya, which rely heavily on growth in the agro-export
sector associated with non-traditional crops, signiﬁcant
backward linkages may also be developed via contract
farming. Of concern in this context, however, is the ability of large buyers, often in the United States and Europe,
to dictate prices, quality and other standards, and thereby
discipline supply chains in order to manage reputational
risk, increase control and externalize costs.69
Mainstream literature on CSR often ignores the contribution to economic and social development associated with
the embeddedness of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Such enterprises are frequently connected more organically
to local societies through employment generation, reinvestment of proﬁts and social and cultural ties. Similarly,
large home-grown corporations or business groups in developing countries, such as the Arvind Mafatlal, Bajaj and
Tata groups in India, the San Miguel Corporation in the
Philippines, Anglogold Ashanti and Sasol in South Africa,
and Natura and Petrobras in Brazil gained a reputation in
the ﬁeld of social responsibility long before the Westernized notion of CSR was transmitted to developing countries via global value chains and NGO networks. In India,
Gandhian ideas associated with trusteeship inﬂuenced several business leaders.70 In Brazil, the Philippines and South
Africa, corporate social activism took off when a powerful
sector of the big business community, sometimes allied with
a progressive sector of the church, realized a third way was
needed between repressive regimes and social unrest.71

5. The Potential and Limits
of Collaborative Institutions
Collaborative institutions – the fourth condition, identifed in
section 1, conducive to business playing a constructive role
in inclusive development – have evolved in ways that bear
some similarities and differences to historical experiences
noted above. In this section, particular attention is focused
on social dialogue, bargaining and business associations.

250

Social dialogue and bargaining help
drive corporate change
Growing recognition of the key role of institutions in development and good governance has redirected attention to
the importance of social dialogue and participation. As discussed above in relation to CSR, a proliferation of institutions is bringing business and civil society actors together in
collaborative arrangements associated with standard setting
and implementation. In such arrangements, the state generally assumes a lower proﬁle than was the case historically
under policy regimes that encouraged social dialogue. Furthermore, many NGOs enter into collaborative relations
with corporations that inevitably circumscribe the nature
of their demands and actions, particularly in cases where
they were funded by corporations. Power relations within
these partnerships are often heavily weighted in favour of
corporate interests. In this respect they are quite different
from the social pacts and compromises involving labour
that were a feature of some countries or regions, referred to
earlier, that achieved improvements in social well-being for
low-income groups.
The considerable attention that has been given to promoting consultative processes and partnerships has diverted
attention from the crucial role of bargaining among actors
who have not only voice, but also leverage. Trade unions
and some larger NGOs, such as the Centre for Science and
Environment in India or Ibase in Brazil, can extract concessions from large corporations because of their capacity
to name and shame, mobilize workers and consumers, and
access policy or regulatory processes.
At the international level, global union federations are
adapting to globalization by promoting international
framework agreements with TNCs that transpose certain
aspects of industrial relations from the national to the global arena. Such agreements attempt to ﬁll one of the most
glaring gaps in global governance institutions, namely the
absence of collective bargaining at the global level. Under
approximately 60 agreements now signed, TNCs agree to
apply a set of standards throughout their global enterprise
structure. From a policy regime perspective, it is apparent

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 9 – BUSINESS, POWER AND POVERTY REDUCTION

that TNCs from countries such as France and Germany that
are associated with the so-called coordinated market model
are more inclined to enter into such agreements than those
from liberal regimes, such as the United States.

Broad-based business associations can
be forces for inclusive development
Umbrella business organizations and public-private partnerships are collaborative institutions that bear some
similarity to those seen historically in today’s advanced
economies. At both national and international levels, corporations are increasingly collaborating among themselves
as well as with government and civil society organizations
to promote and set standards, and to facilitate their application. So, too, are peak associations, which represent ﬁrms
and employers engaged in multiple industries and sectors.
Organizations such as the International Chamber of Commerce, the International Organisation of Employers, the
World Business Council for Sustainable Development and
the World Economic Forum have emerged as major players
in the promotion of CSR and public-private partnerships.
Corporations often organize around largely sectoral initiatives, as in the case of Responsible Care, the Common
Code for the Coffee Community, the International Cocoa
Initiative, the ETI, the EITI and the FLA. As explained
above, though such forms of privatized regulation can
have contradictory implications vis-à-vis inclusive development and democratic governance, they have facilitated
certain forms of social dialogue. They have also directed
the attention of organized business interests to the social
and environmental dimensions of development and the
need to ﬁll governance gaps associated with globalization
and liberalization.
In some countries that have experienced rapid liberalization, business associations have remained fairly weak.
In Kenya and Zambia, for instance, this has resulted
from the economic vulnerability of certain ﬁrms and
industries, clientelistic relationships and political intervention. In other countries, such as India, rapid economic

and structural change has resulted in the splintering of
established organizations and the emergence of competing associations, representing new economic actors.
But in this case, some business associations have moved
from being defensive to proactive in terms of policy
advocacy, knowledge generation and the provision of
support services.72

In the wake of trade liberalization
in Brazil, national business interests
came together to lobby on a range
of policies and laws
In Brazil, a more cohesive approach to collective business
action has emerged in the wake of trade liberalization. Here,
two factors came together: national business interests experienced severe shocks from the rapid opening up to foreign
competition in the 1980s. At the same time, businesses also
agreed that a relatively autonomous technocracy should
not be allowed to decide the new rules of the game without
their having a voice at the table. Various business interests
therefore came together to lobby on a range of policies and
laws that affected competitiveness, as well as on ongoing
trade negotiations.73
A key determinant of how conducive collective business
actions are to inclusive development is how encompassing business associations are, in terms of the sectors and
types of ﬁrms they represent. The number of countries with
private-sector umbrella organizations has expanded under
liberalization, but they are often dominated by the interests
of large corporations. Given the importance of small- and
medium-sized enterprises in local economic development
and employment generation, the question of their ability
to organize to gain voice, inﬂuence and bargaining power
is essential. Lack of resources and the dispersion of such
enterprises often greatly complicate this task. Even in
regions such as Europe, where organizational potential
tends to be greater and is often supported by government
policy and law, there is a low propensity for small- and

251

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

medium-sized enterprises to associate in the more wellendowed peak business associations.74 Joining such organizations may facilitate access to free services, but it is the
interests of larger corporations that are likely to be heard
in the relevant advocacy networks attempting to frame and
inﬂuence public policy.

Collective business actions involving
small- and medium-sized enterprises
International development organizations are actively
promoting the creation and support of business associations. However, there are considerable variations not
only in the types of organizational structures involving
small- and medium-sized enterprises, but also in their
developmental and political implications. For example,
associations representing small- and medium-sized enterprises from multiple sectors may be incorporated into
associations that are dominated by big business interests.
Or, small-enterprise associations may fragment along
ethnic and religious lines. Research in sub-Saharan Africa
shows that this often occurs in contexts where structural
adjustment programmes and rapid economic liberalization
have marginalized the small businesses and resulted in weak
state support structures and programmes. A coping strategy
for clustered ﬁrms in Nigeria, for example, has been to
gain access to resources by integrating local clientelistic
political and social networks associated with particular
ethnic and religious groups.75 Business groups in some of
the more successful Southeast Asian economies, such as
Malaysia, have also organized along ethnic lines. In such
cases, however, they have tended to support, implicitly or
explicitly, national development strategies, whether due
to the beneﬁts of high growth or more direct forms of
state support.

Often, the driving forces
behind collective business
action involving small- and
medium-sized enterprises are
external shocks

252

Often, the driving forces behind collective business action
involving small- and medium-sized enterprises are external shocks. This can occur, for example, when non-tariff
trade barriers are suddenly imposed on developing country producers, or cheaper or better products suddenly enter
an economy.76 Such associative activity, however, may
have varied implications vis-à-vis poverty reduction.
It is common for small-enterprise associations to push
for exemptions from ﬁscal and social insurance responsibilities, and from meeting labour and environmental
standards. And politicians may seek to comply with such
demands for short-term political gain and to safeguard the
employment-generating role of this sector, albeit by reproducing poor quality jobs.77 This burden-reducing approach,
which clearly has contradictory implications from the perspective of poverty reduction, can be aided and abetted
by the current orientation of some international development agencies that support the development of small- and
medium-sized enterprises in general, rather than the type
of strategic interventions that support the development of
particular products or sectors. Such interventions were a
feature of both the East Asian and Nordic development
paths, as well as successful cluster development in some of
today’s less developed countries.

6. Towards Corporate
Accountability: Implications
for Policy
The above discussion suggests that national and international
policy and institutions are often pulling in contradictory
directions from the perspective of inclusive development.
Standard setting for CSR, for example, may attempt to raise
the bar in relation to working conditions, environmental
management systems and respect for indigenous rights. But
policies and institutions associated with economic liberalization often exert undue pressures on wages, labour rights and
small enterprises; reduce state capacity to inspect workplace
conditions; and encourage transnational mining and other
corporations to expand operations in environmentally and

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 9 – BUSINESS, POWER AND POVERTY REDUCTION

culturally sensitive areas. TNCs may raise labour standards
within their core enterprises, but rely increasingly on subcontractors whose working conditions and labour relations
are often worse. Consultative processes may provide a place
at the table for a variety of stakeholders, but the increasing
power and inﬂuence of corporations and their growing legitimacy in global governance often marginalize the voices of
other actors.

National and international
policy and institutions are often
pulling in contradictory directions
from the perspective of inclusive
development

Such contrasts suggest that far greater attention needs
to be paid to the tensions, trade-offs and contradictions
inherent in contemporary policy approaches and institutional arrangements. From the perspective of inclusive
development, a key challenge is not only to promote
employment-centred structural change, as discussed in
Section one of this report, or transformative social policy, as discussed in Section two, but also to reassert social
control over markets and large corporations via various forms of regulation and the reconﬁguration of power
relations. From the perspective of efforts to promote
CSR and corporate accountability more speciﬁcally,
the analysis in this chapter points to a dual challenge –
one developmental, the other regulatory. Both the mainstream CSR agenda and the corporate accountability
movement need to pay more attention to the development
implications of institutional reforms. Such implications
relate in particular to impacts on suppliers, employment
of unskilled workers, corporate taxation, linking CSR
and national development strategies and priorities, and
inclusive business models that focus less on consumerism
and more on enhancing skills and productive capacities.
Also important is greater inclusion of developing country

perspectives and stakeholders in consultative and decisionmaking processes.

Create an enabling environment
for collective action
The regulatory challenge relates to the need to strengthen
countervailing forces and institutional arrangements that
can moderate forms of business inﬂuence and practices
that have perverse social and developmental implications.
These moderating forces range from trade unions and other
labour and human rights organizations to farmers organizations, as well as networks of activists concerned with the
impact of TNCs. The coexistence of diverse forms of civil
society action – both cooperative and confrontational,
associated with information gathering and dissemination,
watchdog activities, channelling grievances through both
non-judicial and judicial mechanisms, policy advocacy,
bargaining and protest – is important to promote business
policies and practices that are supportive of decent work,
local development and transformative social policy. The
fact that different types of ﬁrms and industries relate differently to social and macroeconomic policy (as seen above in
the discussion on business preferences) suggests that there
is signiﬁcant scope to include business actors in coalitions
supportive of transformative change.
The role of civil society organization and mobilization
points to the crucial importance of enacting and enforcing
laws safeguarding freedom of association and the right to
information. Particularly in contexts where state inspection
capacity is weak, governments and aid agencies can support
the work of trade unions and labour rights or human rights
NGOs engaged in monitoring working conditions and
labour rights. Institutions for social dialogue need to guard
against situations where participation is sanitized by being
restricted to the chosen few or where voice and power relations are skewed towards business elites. Governments can
also play a role in fostering business associations that effectively represent the interests of smaller enterprises, through
the provision of incentives, developing the administrative
and technical capacity of business associations, and institutionalizing state-business dialogue.

253

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Forge social pacts between business
and government
The analysis of state-business relations under different
policy regimes and development paths suggests that certain
types of pacts or compromises in which business elites support or accommodate government development strategies
in return for particular beneﬁts have, historically, been an
important feature of models conducive to poverty reduction. Contemporary pacts or partnerships – whether they
be the UN Global Compact or business support for Brazil’s
Zero Hunger initiative – appear to hinge on a bargain where
business is expected to support CSR in return for guarantees from government and leaders to support market liberalization.78 From the perspective of social development,
however, such pacts, which provide more general marketcentred incentives, seem to lack the force of those in East
Asia where large corporations committed to some aspects
of corporate social welfare in return for industrial policies
that provided business-centred incentives. Another variant can be found in contemporary South Africa, where the
shift towards liberalization has seen companies not simply
commit rhetorically to CSR, but actually increase their
relative share of total tax revenues as a percentage of GDP,
although some have not shown the same commitment to
raise investment levels.
In a context where developing country governments
are calling for greater policy space,79 there needs to be
more attention to ensuring that macroeconomic and
labour market policies are less ﬁxated on the priorities of
international ﬁnance and transnational capital, and are
more in tune with the needs and preferences of the wider
business community.

Promote international norms and
laws that regulate TNCs
In the context of globalization, it is clear that international norms and law must play a pivotal role in regulating
TNCs and mobile capital. But the tendency for international “hard” law to be reserved for strengthening corporate

254

rights associated with FDI, trade liberalization and intellectual property, and international “soft” law and voluntary
norms for promoting corporate responsibility needs to be
corrected. The context of the global economic crisis is an
opportune moment to rethink this approach.
The trend within the United Nations to promote voluntary initiatives and corporate self-regulation through the
UN Global Compact and other forums now confronts the
reality that conventional approaches to CSR are severely
limited in terms of ensuring corporate accountability. The
ongoing inquiry within the United Nations in relation to
business and human rights, and the speciﬁc interest in due
diligence and strengthening grievance procedures – generally, adding “teeth” to existing institutions – is potentially
important in this regard.80 So too is the current revision of
the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.81 At a
minimum, the international CSR agenda should address far
more centrally certain issues such as labour rights, industrial relations, conﬂicts of interest, corporate lobbying and
other forms of policy inﬂuence, executive pay, tax evasion
and avoidance, and the social effects of corporate concentration. The discussion in this chapter suggests that proposals related to an international competition authority and a
UN corporate accountability entity engaged in monitoring,
oversight and redress also need to remain on the agenda.82

Bring states back into the
development equation
State regulatory and inspection capacity needs to be
enhanced. However, the analysis also points to various limits as to what should be expected of governments. State
capacity has been rolled back in many countries, and key
sectors of technocracies and political elites have been captured by particular business interests. Corporations are
becoming signiﬁcant actors in global governance. This
points to the role of large ﬁrms as political actors themselves, not simply entities that can be easily regulated by
public policy.83 As political actors, however, they can also
be challenged politically and will need to respond through
compromise or by neutralizing opposition.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 9 – BUSINESS, POWER AND POVERTY REDUCTION

Crafting state-business relations that are conducive to
inclusive development and poverty reduction will require
transformations in collective action and coalitions. Processes and ideologies associated with globalization and
liberalization clearly alter the nature of solutions and the
politics of what is possible. Past state-business-society relations cannot simply be reconstructed. But, as indicated
above, it is possible to envisage certain forms of collective
business and civil society action that could potentially
play an important role in this respect. Particular attention
has been focused on the types of demands, proposals, networks and coalitions associated with the growing corporate
accountability movement, as well as the need to move
beyond a focus on either the ﬁrm or the nation-state, to
actions and institutional arrangements that operate and
connect on multiple scales.

This suggests that states need to play a more central role
in the development equation. As indicated in chapter 10,
this requires not only accepting the principle of policy
space, but actually strengthening state capacities related
to resource mobilization and enforcement. It also requires
addressing the issue of state capture. If states are to be captured, it should not be by corporate elites but, as chapter
11 suggests, by an empowered citizenry through the institutions of democracy and collective action.

CHAPTER

Building State Capacity
for Poverty Reduction
For development strategies to generate the types of structural change and corporate behaviour conducive to equitable growth and poverty reduction described in this report,
states must possess certain capacities. They must be able
to overcome critical market failures; assist in the acquisition of new technologies; mobilize and channel resources
to productive sectors; enforce standards and regulations;
establish social pacts; and fund, deliver and regulate services and social programmes. Governments must also be
able to reach political settlements with domestic actors in
deﬁning public policies and creating developmental and
welfare-enhancing bureaucracies. Such settlements may
differ in authoritarian and democratic regimes. In the ﬁrst
case, they tend to be top-down, while in the second, they
generally require a broader power base and more engagement with citizens.
States that can deliver growth-oriented and welfareenhancing structural change need to be rule based, not
beholden to patronage, knowledgeable about the economy
and society, and staffed by adequately paid and trained
individuals. They also need to be able to mobilize domestic
resources and strengthen capacities to inﬂuence and discipline investor behaviour. Current international development policies that emphasize a standard set of market
reforms pursued through various types of conditionality
limit the policy space in which national actors can pursue
alternative development strategies.
From the 1950s to the early 1980s, most developing countries prioritized growth through active state intervention.
This period saw the rapid expansion of the public sector,
as governments provided incentives to the private sector
to invest, while also establishing parastatal organizations to
undertake activities in sectors where private entrepreneurs
were slow to respond to incentives or had no interest in
investing. However, many states were unable to develop

10

the requisite governance capacities for the effective implementation of their strategies.
A few countries, largely those in East Asia, did break out of
poverty in a sustained way and emerged as economic giants
during the period, doing so under authoritarian political systems. A number of countries with democratic regimes combined moderate growth with redistribution and achieved
spectacular gains in social development. And many middle- and low-income countries initially achieved high growth
rates and industrialization, but failed to give the majority of
their populations the means to lift themselves out of poverty.
By the 1980s, a large group of countries were experiencing budgetary and balance of payments crises that led to
a questioning of state-led development strategies and to
a retreat of the state from direct economic activities. In
responding to these crises, the adjustment model recommended by the international ﬁnancial institutions (IFIs)
did not initially address governance issues directly. Instead,
state institutions were treated as a dependent variable, by
assuming that once market prices were set right, the state
would be efﬁcient in its task of rule enforcement, protection
of property rights and public administration. Market actors
would then invest, generate growth and reduce poverty.
However, the poor growth record associated with structural
adjustment programmes (SAPs) has, in recent years, led to
a policy stance that advocates an active role of institutions
in promoting development. This approach emphasizes the
crafting of institutions to promote the rule of law, protect
property rights, lower expropriation risk, reduce levels of
corruption and improve regulatory quality – policies that
have come to deﬁne the good governance agenda.
Closely related to this approach to good governance were
a second set of managerial reforms. Called New Public
Management, they sought to promote market principles

257

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

in the governance of the public sector. They challenged
public administration principles in which the purchasing,
provisioning and policy dimensions of service provision are
concentrated in a uniﬁed bureaucracy, driven by the values of public service. Instead, the new reforms advocated
decentralized management, performance contracts and the
contracting out of services.
A third set of reforms have been concerned with decentralization, which has come to be seen as an aspect of good
governance. Proponents of decentralization assume that,
by bringing government closer to where services are used,
decentralization will reduce rent-seeking behaviour, enable
the public to hold government providers to account, and
allow market and other non-state actors to participate in
service provision that will beneﬁt the poor.
These three types of governance reforms can be described
as market enhancing. But while they can contribute to
greater efﬁciency, more accountability and transparency
on the part of government, and increased citizen participation, they do not necessarily promote sustained growth or
improve state capacity for delivering equitable economic
and social outcomes. They also differ from the growth and
welfare-enhancing strategies deployed by early industrializers or, more recently, by successful developmental states.

Market-enhancing reforms can
contribute to more efﬁcient, accountable
and transparent government, but they
do not necessarily promote sustained
growth or equitable outcomes
The analysis in this chapter points to four main conclusions.
• Most states that eventually proved successful in
achieving high growth and structural change did
not have the necessary capacities to do so at ﬁrst.
Rather, these capacities were built over time through
purposeful leadership and the formation of strategic ties
with citizens and business.

258

• Coercion is not sufﬁcient for building effective
state capacity even in authoritarian settings and
is unsustainable in the long run. Such capacity
requires an ability to provide wide-ranging and good
quality services and protections to broad sections
of the population.
• Governments must improve domestic resource
mobilization in order to create more policy space and
be able to set agendas, strengthen links with citizens,
and inﬂuence the strategies of business groups and
service providers.
• The capacity to allocate resources effectively and
enforce rules regarding their use can be improved
through citizen participation in monitoring
development agents and service providers. Such
participation can also reduce the costs involved in
enforcing policies.
• Aspects of market-enhancing reforms, including good
governance, managerialism and decentralization
are desirable goals for all countries, but they do not
necessarily generate and sustain growth or produce
socially equitable outcomes.
Section 1 of the chapter examines the institutions, policies
and dynamics that have enabled some states to build up
developmental and welfare-enhancing capacities. It contrasts the experiences of successful and less successful states
by examining three dimensions of state capacity: political
capacity, resource mobilization capacity, and allocative and
enforcement capacity.
Section 2 discusses the market-enhancing reforms of good
governance, managerialism and decentralization. The key
questions it seeks to answer are: if states are to play an active
role in development, what kinds of institutions and policies
are needed to make such states effective? What lessons of
state building can be learned from successful developmental
states? And how appropriate are current market-enhancing
state reforms in sustaining growth and generating social
outcomes that are beneﬁcial to the poor?
Section 3 concludes the chapter with implications for
policy.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 10 – BUILDING STATE CAPACITY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

1. Dimensions of State Capacity
That Promote Development
States that have been effective in promoting growth and
structural change that reduce poverty do not generally
inherit the right capacities or bureaucracies for development. They build them. A political leadership committed
to fast growth and equality must reach a political settlement with domestic actors that allows it to deﬁne the direction of public policy and then create a developmental and
welfare-enhancing bureaucracy to support it.

States that have been effective in
promoting growth and structural
change do not generally inherit the
right capacities or bureaucracies for
development. They build them
Three issues are important in gauging the developmental
and welfare-promoting capacities of states. The ﬁrst is political capacity, which addresses the extent to which the necessary coalitions or political settlements can be built that
will allow governments to deﬁne, adopt and implement
policies. The second is resource mobilization capacity – that
is, the ability of states to generate resources for investment
and social development, which may be an index of statesociety relations. The third is the capacity to allocate
resources to productive and welfare-enhancing sectors, as
well as to ensure that favoured sectors comply with agreedupon rules. As discussed below, these capacities may take
different forms under different types of political regimes.

Political capacity is fundamental
to setting and implementing policy
Governments face constraints in deﬁning, adopting and
implementing policies, including the possibility of policy
capture by powerful segments of the population, opposition

by organized interest groups, and intractable conﬂicts based
on ethnic or religious cleavages. To overcome such constraints, authoritarian regimes with a developmental orientation often rely on top-down methods of coercion and
control, as well as on high growth, employment expansion,
and the provision of job security, services and social protection. In democratic regimes, citizens enjoy basic rights
and the freedom to contest, frustrate or block state policies,
making it difﬁcult to rely on coercion and control to push
through policies. Democratic regimes with good development outcomes engage citizens more actively in order to
build the necessary consensus and support for state policies.
Redistributive policies and respect for the right to contest
policies and make claims are therefore central to the strategies of political capacity building in such regimes.

Building political capacity in authoritarian
developmental states
Authoritarian developmental states prioritize growth as the
fundamental objective of public policy, concentrate power
at the top of the political establishment, and use state power
to discipline society and drive development.1 The historical circumstances associated with the emergence of these
relatively effective states are not easily replicated. In all the
major cases, the perception of external threats was intense,
thus providing strong incentives for concerted policy, cooperation among elites and adoption of a nationalistic ideology
(often given economic, political and cultural expression).2
The coherence of a coalition of domestic elites – either of
a dominant actor (such as the military) or in the form of a
compromise among elites around a set of rules – has been
shaped by shared perceptions of external threats, and radical
opposition has often quickly and effectively been neutralized
or co-opted. In addition, political, military and ideological
power was concentrated in the hands of the state, at least
in the formative stage, which was conducive to policy continuity. A combination of these factors enabled these types
of regimes to impose a set of developmentally driven rules
governing economy and polity in order to protect and promote national interest, if not survival. In short, “their politics were developmentally driven and their development
was politically driven because growth was seen as important
for national autonomy and defence”.3 Most developmental

259

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

states also enjoyed considerable moral, diplomatic and material (ﬁnancial and military) support from major Western
powers in the context of the cold war. Given the urgency
of their goals, developmental states were quick to develop
effective bureaucracies with the means to ensure infrastructural power4 – that is, the capacity to devise, implement and
achieve social, economic and policy goals. These bureaucracies were also generally well trained, well paid and highly
competitive with respect to recruitment and promotion.5
The construction of political capacity for East Asian states
to become developmental required the establishment of a
tightly knit state structure that was capable of maintaining both distance (autonomy) and collaboration (embeddedness) with private capital, as well as controlling and
mobilizing labour for industrialization.6 In Taiwan Province of China, the ruling regime enjoyed an exceptional,
if not absolute, degree of autonomy from all sectors of
society, including local elites, residual feudal elements and
the emerging working class. To consolidate its rule in the
1950s, the Kuomintang (KMT) broke the power of the
Taiwanese ruling class through land reforms. The reforms
not only destroyed the powerful landlord class, they also
eliminated a signiﬁcant source of political instability in
the countryside.7 Authoritarian power was supported by
strong corporatist-type institutions, such as the 340 farmers associations that had been penetrated by the KMT, the
China National Association of Industry and Commerce,
the China Federation of Labour and the Youth Corps.
In the Republic of Korea, the military leadership that
spearheaded the transformation also monopolized and centralized state power. It relied on trusted military ofﬁcers to
head important ministries and agencies and to redirect the
bureaucracy along developmental lines. It beneﬁted from
the land reform of the previous regime that eliminated
landlord power and used propaganda and campaigns to
enhance its legitimacy and achieve its goals.8
Authoritarian developmental states did not rely on coercion
alone in developing political capacity. State services – such
as infrastructure, subsidized fertilizers, improved seedlings,
credit, research support, investment in and regulation of

260

health and education to expand access – and policies of lifelong employment and social insurance for workers in key
industries helped to build state-citizen relations. And after a
certain level of transformation had been achieved, top-down
strategies of coercion and control proved unsustainable. In
general, the East Asian authoritarian developmental states
sought to legitimize their rule by developing economically
and ensuring a steadily rising standard of living. As economic
growth occurred, there was a proliferation of economic and
other social interests and an expanding and demanding middle class, as well as an effective and mobilized trade union
movement, acting to strengthen civil society and intensify
its demands. These factors helped to shape the transition to
democracy in the 1980s and beyond.9

Authoritarian developmental states
did not rely on coercion alone in
developing political capacity
The types of state-society relations developed by these East
Asian developmental regimes have been rare in the developing world. The vast majority of authoritarian regimes
worldwide are non-developmental and unstable, which
underscores the limitations of authoritarian strategies for
building effective states. Brazil pursued East Asian–type
strategies during its period of military rule, especially in the
1960s and 1970s. It prioritized high growth, but its transformation of society did not reach the scale of the East Asian
cases. The military was still relatively divided, regional oligarchs still held power in large areas of public life, and high
levels of inequality blunted the legitimacy and appeal of the
regime.10 In many authoritarian middle-income countries,
the political leadership was often beholden to landholding oligarchs and business elites. Where industrialization
was limited and agrarian relations were fairly inequitable,
as in many least developed countries, military and singleparty dictatorships emerged with no sustained commitment
to growth. In some cases, ethnic polarization, civil wars
and donor inﬂuence in policy making acted as additional
checks on political capacity.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 10 – BUILDING STATE CAPACITY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

Building political capacity in democratic
developmental states
Authoritarian approaches to building political capacity
are not only unsustainable, they can also cause the political leadership to perceive societal challenges as systemic
threats requiring repressive responses. In addition, such
approaches limit the development of a healthy, open and
mature relationship between states and citizens and lead to
a reversal of social and economic gains when the authoritarian regime collapses. Furthermore, authoritarian developmental regimes are not only difﬁcult to replicate under
current conditions, but authoritarian methods of political
capacity building have been rendered unacceptable by the
democratic norms and values that now inform international
development policies. Democracies allow for greater participation by citizens in the construction of capacities and formulation of public policies – especially those important for
the well-being of deprived social groups – and can handle
open conﬂicts without experiencing systemic threats. It is
true that democracies differ in quality, and many have been
unsuccessful in building political capacity for development
and poverty reduction. However, as chapter 11 will show,
a number of democracies that can be described as developmental have been able to develop effective and cohesive
states that have delivered good outcomes.
A central concern for policy makers and investors in
all developmental states – whether democratic or authoritarian – is ensuring that wage increases do not outpace
productivity gains or spur inﬂation. Authoritarian regimes
may resolve the wage problem by repressing workers,
whereas democracies are more likely to develop social
pacts with the working population using strong redistributive policies. The participation of subaltern groups is
therefore essential in building political capacity and
resolving the tension between proﬁts and welfare in
developmental democracies.
As chapter 11 will reveal, democracies have been able to
regulate distributional conﬂicts and promote favourable
macroeconomic and welfare outcomes when the workforce
is highly unionized, collective bargaining agreements cover
large sections of the working population, and bargaining

takes place at the national level. In agrarian developmental democracies, such as Costa Rica, the state of Kerala in
India, and Mauritius, political capacities for development
and welfare promotion were nurtured through active citizenship, the crafting of political parties that were strongly
oriented towards equality, the self-organization of subaltern
groups and alliances, strong party–social movement ties and
electoral competitiveness that gave value to the votes of
the poor. The redistributive social policies of such regimes
were often part of political settlements that allowed states
to pursue effective growth strategies.

Authoritarian approaches to
building political capacity are not
only unsustainable, they can also
cause the leadership to see societal
challenges as systemic threats
requiring repressive responses
The role of popular pressure in building political capacity is vividly illustrated by comparing the performances of
states across India, an established democracy. As table 10.1
and box 10.1 show, the southern states and West Bengal
outperform India’s northern states in poverty reduction,
despite the fact that all of them are democratic. In the
southern states, however, the power of dominant elites
was effectively challenged, allowing middle castes and
classes, and, in some instances, even lower classes, to shape
state policies. Support from popular classes empowered
state ofﬁcials to overcome strategies of resistance or patronage from dominant classes. In contrast, the main mode of
politics in northern states well into the late twentieth
century was Congress Party rule, which rested on a narrow political base of upper castes and classes. With patronclient ties at the core of political society, factional and
personalistic disputes among politicians were the deﬁning
trait of state politics. Such disputes detracted from any type
of constructive use of state power, whether in promoting
growth or distribution.11

As table 10.1 shows, all four southern states of India – Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu – along with West Bengal,
are among the top 50 per cent of states that have made the greatest progress in reducing poverty. In contrast, all of the Hindi-heartland
states – Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh – along with Rajasthan, are among the bottom half of states that have made the
least progress.

The hypothesis that best explains these patterns is that poverty has been reduced the most in states where effective government power
rests on a broad political base. In such cases, rulers have minimized the hold of upper classes on the state, successfully organized the
middle and lower strata into an effective power bloc, and then used this power to channel resources to the poor. Poverty, for example,
has been reduced sharply in Kerala and West Bengal. Underlying this achievement are complex historical roots, including the political
mobilization of lower castes and classes well before independence. This broadened political base then facilitated the rise of a wellorganized Communist Party to power. A pro-poor regime interacted with a more effective citizenry, creating what has been called
a virtuous cycle.a This created both supply and demand for a variety of successful pro-poor public policies, including land reforms,
higher investments in and better implementation of education and health policies, along with greater gender equality.b

How does one interpret the fact that all of India’s southern states, not just Kerala and West Bengal, are above average in their capacity
to alleviate poverty? India’s southern states share two sets of distinguishing political traits. Narrow domination of the Brahmin
caste was more effectively challenged in all the southern states relatively early in the twentieth century.c Since independence,
the political base of power in these states has generally been middle castes and classes, and in some instances even lower classes.d
The situation differs from the Hindi heartland states, where Brahmin domination was challenged only relatively recently. The other factor,
which has not been well researched, is the generally superior quality of state-level bureaucracy in the south. Among state-level
bureaucrats there appears to be a keen sense of professionalism more akin to the Indian Administrative Service than to prevailing
practices in the Hindi heartland. Its roots may go back to the traditions of direct rule, when much of southern India was part of
the Madras Presidency.e

Several governance issues affecting political capacities
remain unresolved in a large number of low-income countries. These relate to the protection of civic rights; ensuring
that leaders have real mandates to govern; having a fairly
representative public sector, especially in contexts of ethnic
diversity;12 and creating effective channels through which
citizens can pressure public ofﬁcials to promote development and deliver public services.

The capacity to mobilize resources is key
to achieving development goals
The capacity of states to mobilize resources is a second
key measure of the extent to which they can achieve their
development objectives. The capacity to mobilize resources
improves policy space and the ability to set agendas, and
empowers states to inﬂuence the orientation and strategies

263

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

of civic and business groups. However, resource mobilization is highly political. It generates conﬂicts over types
of resources to be mobilized, who pays, how much should
be paid, and how the resources collected should be allocated across sectors, groups and communities. In other
words, state commitment to resource mobilization does not
guarantee that the desired amount of resources will be generated, let alone allocated to preferred programmes, or that
the burden of resource extraction will be distributed fairly
among different population groups. Issues of trust, solidarity,
consensus and reciprocity in state-society relations deﬁne
the extent to which governments can succeed in extracting
resources from the populace. In short, building state capacity
for resource mobilization is an index of the types of relations
states develop with society. Redistributive arrangements
underpin successful strategies of resource mobilization in
both authoritarian and democratic regimes.
Chapter 8 has discussed a variety of revenue sources for
the ﬁnancing of social policies. Table 10.2 shows that
while tax revenue as a share of gross domestic product
(GDP) in Africa and Latin America was similar to that of
East Asia from the mid-1980s to 2000, there were sharp differences in the savings rates among the regions. East Asia’s
average savings rate, as a percentage of GDP, was more than
double that of South Asia and Africa, and two-thirds higher

than that of Latin America. The great divergence in savings
rates among regions occurred mainly after 1980.13 From 1960
to 1974, gross savings relative to GDP in Africa increased
from about 18 per cent to 24 per cent and reached a peak of
26 per cent in 1980 before falling dramatically during the
period of SAPs. During much of the 1970s, in fact, Africa’s
savings rate was higher than the average for Latin America.

Mobilizing savings in authoritarian and
democratic developmental states
East Asia’s high savings rates were largely a product of incentives and the coercive power of the state, which was deployed
to mobilize resources through various forms of forced savings. Among the key elements were restrictions on consumer
credit, ﬁnancial restraint, mandatory pension contributions
and the encouragement of postal savings. In the Republic
of Korea, a culture of private savings was promoted by the
regime of Park Chung-Lee by establishing multiple interest
rates – with high interest rates for savers and cheaper rates
for borrowers – and a number of campaigns were launched
to encourage thrift.14 The mobilization of savings was also
very successful in Taiwan Province of China. Indeed, unlike
the Republic of Korea, which combined domestic savings
and large loans from Japan to ﬁnance its industrialization,
Taiwan Province of China ﬁnanced its industrial investment
almost entirely from domestic savings.15

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 10 – BUILDING STATE CAPACITY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

In Singapore, high savings were achieved through a compulsory social security savings plan established in 1955
that originally focused on retirement beneﬁts but was subsequently extended to cover housing and health needs.
The Provident Fund mandates every Singaporean wage
earner to save a portion of his or her monthly income
in an individualized account as social security savings,
with a proportional contribution from the employer.
The fund is managed as a statutory board of the government, which provides a ﬁxed annual interest. This
was only 2 per cent before being raised to 3 per cent
in 2008. The savings rate peaked in 1984, with savings
of 25 per cent of the monthly wage and an equivalent
contribution from the employer. However, the employer’s
contribution was radically reduced to 10 per cent during the 1997 Asian ﬁnancial crisis. Since that time, savings rates for both parties have been adjusted and are now
graduated according to age. The fund was used to ﬁnance
infrastructure and other administrative expenditures in
the early years of independence and has evolved into an
instrument to control wages and to maintain global market competitiveness.16 Singapore’s gross national savings,
which reached almost 50 per cent of GDP between 1991
and 2000, is the highest in the world.
The high savings accumulated in authoritarian developmental states raised the capacities of those states to exercise autonomy in policy making, avoid capture by powerful
groups, provide leadership in the development process, and
nurture and sanction the behaviour of economic and social
groups in pursuing development goals. Savings rates have
also been high in some democracies that have achieved
good welfare outcomes, such as Costa Rica and Mauritius,
suggesting that resource mobilization can be achieved if
regimes enjoy broad support, the prevailing economic and
political environment is favourable, and savings instruments are easily accessible. Costa Rica and Mauritius
have highly developed ﬁnancial sectors that have been
instrumental in mobilizing savings. Savings have been
generated not only through the banking system, but also
through insurance companies and, like Singapore, through
social security funds such as pensions. The gross domestic
savings rates of Costa Rica and Mauritius averaged above

20 per cent of GDP during the 1990s and compare favourably with other countries in their respective regions.

Building state-citizen relations through taxation
A key feature of developmental states – whether authoritarian or democratic – is the way resource mobilization
strategies facilitated the territorial and social reach of the
state and the building of effective state-citizen relations.
Tax strategies often brought the state into direct contact
with citizens, thus allowing the state to inﬂuence behaviour and providing beneﬁts for taxes collected. Chapter 8 has shown that East Asia collects more direct taxes
than most developing countries. Land and property taxes
enhanced the reach of the state. The Japanese colonial allembracing land-tax policy and post-colonial land reforms
reduced landlord power, developed smallholder agriculture,
and deepened the state’s presence in the countryside. State
services – such as infrastructure, subsidized fertilizers and
improved seeds – given in return for land taxes, increased
the growth of agricultural productivity.17

In developmental states,
resource mobilization
strategies helped build effective
state-citizen relations
In the case of Mauritius, export taxes on sugar, the main
export commodity in the nineteenth and most of the twentieth centuries, had several positive effects on state-society
relations and in increasing the productive capacity of the
sugar sector.18 First, the tax was an effective substitute for
income taxes, and was generally progressive, since it shifted
the burden of taxation and redistributive spending to the
upper and middle classes. This contributed to a public sense
of fairness and solidarity and thus built up state legitimacy.
Second, the tax was used by the state to ﬁnance research
and development, infrastructure and marketing, which
enhanced production and productivity growth in the sugar
sector. Third, the tax helped the private sector organize,
and it built its capacity to interact with the government

265

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

over time. Moreover, it helped both the state and society
to solve collective action problems they faced in building skills and in supporting research on sugar. Finally, the
export tax helped develop the territorial reach of the state
since the tax affected the main employer in the countryside
and promoted mutually beneﬁcial rights and obligations
between the state and farmers, both large and small. Much
of this occurred within a democratic context.

Expanding state reach through agricultural
marketing boards
During the period of state-led development in Africa, part
of which was associated with high growth rates, agricultural marketing boards attempted to play a similar role in
resource mobilization, expanding the territorial reach of
the state and linking rural interest groups to the state. Marketing boards were an important mechanism of resource
mobilization, monopolizing the purchase of cash crops
below world market prices and selling them abroad at world
market prices. The surplus generated was often of similar
magnitude to the level of formal tax collection in the 1960s
and 1970s. Marketing boards were effective in some countries because the state provided something in return to producer groups, such as services, infrastructure and research.
By the 1980s, however, marketing boards were being criticized in the wake of worsening agricultural performance.19
The idea took hold that the system worsened terms of trade
by paying farmers less than the state received for products
on the world market. This often created disincentives for
farmers to produce, and/or led to smuggling – both of which
reduced the resource mobilization capacity of African
states. Economic liberalization of agriculture was promoted
as the cure for the growth-retarding effects of marketing
boards in many contexts.

The surplus generated by agricultural
marketing boards in Africa was
often of similar magnitude to the
level of formal tax collection in the
1960s and 1970s

266

However, in the rush to dismantle marketing boards, there
was much less analysis as to why some marketing boards
performed better than others or how the operations of the
boards were intertwined with other public policy goals
and institutions. The historical evidence suggests that the
political power of the state and the nature of the political coalitions underpinning the state are signiﬁcant factors determining the effectiveness of marketing boards.20
For instance, in Taiwan Province of China, where the
power of the landowning class was curtailed in the 1960s,
the state was able to tax rice farming in return for ﬁnancing
inputs that improved the productivity of rice production.
In Africa, the Kenyan coffee board in the 1970s and
1980s was more effective than the Tanzanian coffee board
because the nature of the coalition in power differed in
the two countries. In Kenya, large- and medium-sized
coffee farmers were a powerful interest group, whereas in
the United Republic of Tanzania, coffee farmers were not
powerful in the government’s support base. As a result, policies in Kenya were developed in ways that extracted fewer
net resources from coffee producers than in the United
Republic of Tanzania. The boards were used to target certain public policy goals: to provide foreign exchange for
industrialization and economic development; to protect
the incomes of farmers against world market ﬂuctuations;
and to provide agricultural extension and social services
to farmers and the wider public. The failure of adjustment
policies to comprehend the interconnectedness of the marketing boards to wider institutions and goals exposed gaps
in the institutional setting supporting peasant livelihoods
and national development.

The experience of mineral-rich countries
Mineral-rich countries should be expected to do well in
resource mobilization, especially when commodity prices
are high (see chapter 8). Some countries, such as Botswana,
Chile, Indonesia and Malaysia, have been able to extract
and manage revenues from the mineral sector fairly well.
Democratic Botswana, for instance, has one of the highest savings rates in the world, rising from 16 per cent of
GDP in 1975 to 45 per cent in 1995/1996 (see ﬁgure 10.1).
Until very recently, the major source of such high savings

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 10 – BUILDING STATE CAPACITY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

was the state. While the business sector’s contribution to the
savings rate has improved substantially since the mid-1990s,
household savings are still minuscule, accounting for less
than 5 per cent of GDP. The state established several reserve
funds to protect the revenue generated by the mining sector:
the Domestic Development Fund, which is the key source
for funding development projects; the Revenue Stabilization
Fund, which helps even out ﬂuctuations in revenue trends;
and the Public Debt Service Fund, which became the largest
source of loan funds for state enterprises. These reserve funds
generate substantial proﬁts in off-shore investments and now
constitute a major source of government revenue.21

Saving mineral revenues in
reserve funds can generate
additional government revenue
They have allowed the state to manage distributional conﬂicts as well as build public trust and legitimacy. These savings have also given the state a good deal of autonomy in
economic policy making. As a result, Botswana has managed to avoid aid dependence and the neoliberal policy
reforms experienced in most African countries in the 1980s
and 1990s that further weakened state capacity.

In many countries, the potential to generate revenue from
the mineral sector is not being realized even under democratization, since regimes are adopting neoliberal policies
to win the conﬁdence of investors, the IFIs and bilateral
donors. In Zambia, taxes as a percentage of GDP declined
from 18.4 per cent in 1996 to 17 per cent in 2005. One
of the main reasons is the extraordinarily low royalty the
government set to attract copper mining investment. The
economic policy reforms of 1991–2001 under President
Frederick Chiluba included privatization of the large parastatal mining company, Zambian Consolidated Copper
Mines, attracting large Chinese investments following the
surge in copper prices starting in 2004.
The royalty of 0.6 per cent in the privatized mines is one
of the lowest in the world, prompting even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to suggest that the government consider renegotiating a royalty rate of 3 per cent.
In 2006, the government received just $25 million in copper royalties out of a $2 billion turnover in copper sales.
Mozambique, which is also highly aid dependent and pursuing neoliberal economic policies, had a similarly disappointing experience following the failed economic policies
of the 1970s and 1980s. Growth has been generated by foreign-owned mega-projects in mining and natural resource –
based industrialization. The leading project is Mozal, an
aluminium smelter, which accounts for nearly half of total
manufacturing output. Mozal was given Free Industrial
Zone status, and corporate income taxes are limited to
1 per cent of sales.22 The low resource base of these countries limits their capacity for autonomous policy making.
As box 11.2 in chapter 11 shows, donor intrusion in policy
making is pervasive in Mozambique.

In many mineral-rich countries,
potential revenue is not being realized
since regimes are adopting neoliberal
policies and granting enormous
beneﬁts to foreign companies

267

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

The capacity to put resources to effective
use is the core of state power
The ability to channel ﬁnancial resources to investors,
provide public services and enforce rules about resource
use is at the core of state power.23 States that are effective
in enforcing rules for generating growth and structural
change are often effective in enforcing rules on how public services are delivered. This is because, as we have seen,
resource extraction even in authoritarian developmental
regimes involves redistribution. States that are effective in
mobilizing resources for economic development also provide beneﬁts to taxpayers and savers and, in the process,
earn legitimacy. This compels governments to strengthen
service delivery institutions leading to good social outcomes, as chapters 5 and 6 have shown. Strengthening public service institutions in democratic developmental states
is almost a routine process, given the active role of subaltern
groups in governing coalitions. Governments that ignore
the development imperative and focus only on welfare may
be unsustainable and often fail to craft effective institutions for both accumulation and welfare provision. Those
that focus primarily on stabilization and liberalization may
empower certain types of institutions, such as central banks
and ﬁnance ministries, and neglect social service institutions, which are usually the ﬁrst to be downsized or cut.

States that are effective in mobilizing
resources for economic development
also provide beneﬁts to taxpayers
and savers and, in the process,
earn legitimacy

Building allocative and enforcement capacity
Building allocative and enforcement capacity requires that
states have some measure of control or inﬂuence in the
ﬁnancial system. It also requires bureaucracies that are internally coherent and committed to development goals, have

268

adequately paid and trained staff, well-developed information systems that facilitate effective monitoring, and political
commitment to achieve results. Political commitment can
be enhanced and the cost of enforcement reduced when citizens are provided with accurate information about resource
allocation and participate in the monitoring of resource use.

During the early period of
transformation the East Asian
developmental regimes had state-led
ﬁnancial systems, allowing the state to
combine subsidized credit with other
policy instruments to inﬂuence the
general growth trajectory

Where the ﬁnancial system is dominated by capital markets,
as in the liberal market economies of the United States and
the United Kingdom, the capacity of the state to intervene
in the economy and inﬂuence the ﬂow of ﬁnancial resources
is limited.24 Where the ﬁnancial system is credit based,
states have more leverage in shaping investment outcomes,
especially if they control the key banking institutions.
The ﬁnancial systems of the East Asian developmental
regimes were state led. During the early period of transformation, all banks in the Republic of Korea and Taiwan
Province of China were state owned. This allowed the state
to take a lead role in coordinating investment, although
Taiwan Province of China had a ﬂourishing informal
credit market for small- and medium-sized enterprises.25
The East Asian developmental states did not grant banks
the kinds of autonomy they enjoyed in the credit-based
ﬁnancial systems of European coordinated economies.
Credit control in East Asia allowed the state to select
beneﬁciaries and inﬂuence their investment decisions.
The state combined subsidized credit with other policy
instruments, such as tariff and tax exemptions as well as
export subsidies, to inﬂuence the behaviour of ﬁrms and the
general growth trajectory.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 10 – BUILDING STATE CAPACITY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

Until the 1980s, most developing countries followed
growth-enhancing strategies that had many common elements. In all countries, two primary goals of developmental
interventions were (i) to accelerate resource allocation to
growth sectors, and (ii) to accelerate technology acquisition
in these sectors through a combination of incentives and
directives. To achieve the ﬁrst, a variety of policy instruments were used, including licensing of land use, licensing of foreign exchange use, preferential tariffs and taxes,
and allocation of bank credit. The state sought to play a
lead role in the ﬁnancial system through the creation of
development banks, although the private sector continued
to enjoy a good deal of autonomy in the ﬁnancial system. In
some cases, price controls and ﬁscal transfers were used to
accelerate the transfer of resources to particular sectors. To
achieve the second goal, incentives for technology acquisition included tax breaks or subsidies; protection of particular sectors for domestic producers in infant industries;
licensing of foreign technologies and subcontracting these
to domestic producers; and setting up investment zones for
high-technology industries and subsidizing infrastructure
for them. For both types of policies, growth-enhancing governance required monitoring resource use and withdrawing
resources or support from sectors or ﬁrms that proved to be
making inadequate progress.26
Allocative and enforcement capacities are enhanced when
the state is knowledgeable about the sectors in which it
intervenes. This calls for systematic collection, storage and
analysis of economic and social data of value not only to
government, but also to business and citizens.27 The priority areas for business are technological development,
quality standards, raw materials and changing market conditions. Having this capacity enables governments to identify new opportunities and constraints, and urge ﬁrms to act
upon them, upgrade their activities and climb up the value
chain. Knowledge is enhanced when the state undertakes
research to identify sectors that need upgrading.28
The East Asian developmental states. The East Asian
developmental states invest heavily in industry-based
information gathering and research. This activity is often
carried out by a lead agency entrusted with directing the

industrial transformation – the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry in Japan, the Economic Planning Board
in the Republic of Korea and the Council for Economic
Planning and Development in Taiwan Province of China.
The Republic of Korea mandates all industries to report
regularly on export and other types of business performance. In Taiwan Province of China, a network of publicly
funded research institutes, such as the Industrial Technology Research Institute, the Electronics Research Service
Organization and the Computing and Communications
Laboratory, perform the role of knowledge generation.29

The East Asian developmental
states invest heavily in
industry-based information
gathering and research

These nodal agencies, which are insulated from special interest groups, help to create coherence and direction within the
bureaucracy. Such insulation is crucial, since it provides the
agencies an encompassing or national character and institutional mission to achieve the state’s goals. The nodal agencies
decide which industries to support and which to phase out or
allow to disappear, based on their understanding of a country’s industrial structures and international competitiveness.
They also build support in the private sector for the state’s
plans and facilitate private sector ties with foreign investors and trading companies.30 Monitoring and enforcement
were effective partly because the nodal agencies eschewed
comprehensive state planning or wide-ranging discretionary
powers of the type that were prevalent in the former Soviet
economies. However, there were clearly price distortions and
potential for rent seeking,31 since government planners, who
might not have been infallible in deciding what was best for
the economy, favoured certain sectors.
With regard to the macroeconomy, prices did not deviate
substantially from market-clearing levels, and protections
and subsidies tended to be time-bound. The result is that the

269

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

bureaucracies for monitoring and enforcement were often
not very large, and were staffed by well-paid and trained
individuals recruited through highly competitive examinations. The switch to export-oriented industrialization also
strengthened the enforcement capacity of the state. Local
ﬁrms needed state support to attract foreign – especially
Japanese – capital, break into the US market and maintain
standards. The survival of ﬁrms came to depend largely on
increasing their efﬁciency and export performance, since
they were now competing in a global market, and the state
was reluctant to bail out non-performing companies.32
Poorly performing developing countries. The difﬁcult
part of the allocation process is to enforce decisions about
resource withdrawal when performance is poor. Many
developing countries have failed abysmally on this score,
for a number of reasons.
• The political capacity required to pursue growthenhancing strategies has been weak.
• Preferential credit and other incentives have tended to
be generalized and not directed to any sector or group
of ﬁrms identiﬁed as the growth sectors.
• Countries have lacked a steering agency with the
requisite technical expertise to guide and be responsible
for economic transformation.
• Bureaucrats have often lacked the economic
information needed by business to facilitate a healthy
state-business relationship.
• Finally, since most countries have failed to make the
transition to export-led growth, the discipline provided
by international market competition has not been
available. Firms often enjoyed huge rents, but refused
to comply with agreed-upon targets. In fact,
in many countries, they have succeeded in capturing
the bureaucrats who were supposed to track progress.
In India, industrialists actively supported the expansion
of subsidies and other protectionist schemes, but resisted
efforts to create a strong planning commission that would
monitor and enforce targets.33 The poor development of
enforcement capacity for industrial transformation was
replicated in the social policy ﬁeld. Despite the rhetoric of land reform, the retreat of the state was even more

270

dramatic than in the industrial sector.34 Land reform was
declared the responsibility of individual states, not the central government; and once at the state level, it was allowed
to slowly ﬁzzle out as state legislatures were largely dominated by representatives of landed interests. The state thus
failed to develop the requisite capacity for land reform and
service provision.

Allocative and enforcement
capacity is enhanced by the systematic
collection and analysis of economic and
social data, for use by government,
business and citizens

Improving allocative capacity through
civil society participation
As explained in chapter 9, allocative and enforcement capacities can be improved by involving citizen groups in regulating development agents and service providers in discussing
the conditions under which business can contribute to progressive social outcomes. This requires that governments
make available information required by citizens to hold business groups and providers accountable. The involvement of
informed citizens and non-state actors in articulating citizen
claims and monitoring resource use reduces the cost to government of allocating resources and enforcing policies.
Participatory budgeting – a process involving a range of
civil society actors who deliberate with state ofﬁcials on
how government revenues should be spent – along with
citizen charters, can help strengthen state-society relations
and improve the capacity to enforce rules, especially in
democratic contexts. They have been shown to improve
allocative and enforcement capacities and redistributive
outcomes in situations in which governing elites resolve to
change power structures in favour of the poor and marginalized and where there is a dense network of civil society
groups that can engage government authorities in policy
making (see box 10.2).

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 10 – BUILDING STATE CAPACITY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

BOX 10.2: Decentralization and participation: Porto Alegre, Kerala and West Bengal
Decentralization has produced redistributive outcomes in settings where governing elites seek to change local power structures in favour
of low-income populations and where there is a dense network of civil society groups that can engage local authorities in policy making.
These two conditions inform the experiences of the city of Port Alegre in Brazil and the states of Kerala and West Bengal in India.

One of the most celebrated cases of decentralization is participatory budgeting at the municipal level in Brazil. The process originated
in Porto Alegre in 1989, and has since spread to more than 250 municipalities in Brazil and 40 other countries. This form of local
governance arose from the strong ties between civil society organizations and the Partido de Trabalhadores or Workers’ Party, which
espoused a social democratic agenda. Brazil’s decentralization involves real devolution of resources and authority over basic social
service provision to local governments. Fifteen per cent to 18 per cent of government spending, or 7 per cent of GDP, is controlled
by local governments.a Participatory budgeting involves the division of a municipality into regions, each of which elects voluntary
delegates. Throughout the year, government-sponsored meetings are held to discuss the budget, and ﬁnal projects are submitted to a
vote by delegates. The plans for the municipality are then included in the budget presented to the municipal legislative chamber.

In Porto Alegre, participatory budgeting has led to considerable increases in the number of households with access to water and sewerage,
children in public schools and paved roads; it has also led to the expansion of local government revenues.b The main factors contributing to
the success of the process include the willingness of mayors to delegate authority to citizens; the extent to which the rules of participation
give genuine authority to residents to make decisions; and the ability of civil society organizations to cooperate in the programme through
a politics of contestation.c In Porto Alegre, participatory budgeting has changed the decision-making process and expanded political
rights and accountability to low-income citizens: 78 per cent of participants earned less than $400 per month, 75 per cent had less than
a high school diploma, 71 per cent were women, and 80 per cent were active in civic associations. Since the Workers’ Party initially
enjoyed only a minority of the popular vote in the cities it governed, mayors saw participatory budgeting as a tool to extend their reach
to the electorate, bypass conservative patronage-dispensing elites, and reorder the way the local state was governed. However, in other
cities governed by other parties, this has not been the case. In Blumenau, inﬂuential groups co-opted the participatory process and
the mayor limited the delegation of authority because of party differences with groups that had taken control of the process. Similarly,
in São Paolo, factional ﬁghts resulted in the mayor centralizing authority, with participants unable to hold the municipality accountable.
These contrasting cases show that where participatory budgeting has been implemented from above – rather than as a result of claims
made on local governments by well-organized civil society organizations – the outcomes are often less impressive.

Kerala and West Bengal present similar dynamics. In West Bengal, decentralization was introduced by the Communist Party as a tool
to undermine the hold of the rival Congress Party and landowning classes on rural politics and to facilitate land redistribution in favour
of the poor. About half of local government councils, or gram panchayats, are either small farmers, sharecroppers or farm labourers,d
although the quality of their participation in meetings remains low. In Kerala, decentralization led to the transfer of political, ﬁscal
and administrative powers with the result that 35–40 per cent of all planned expenditures are directly allocated to 1,214 panchayats
and municipalities.e The communist-led state government supported decentralization because it wanted to maintain its redistributive
agenda, despite the state’s ﬁscal problems. It tried to bypass the clientelistic bureaucratic structures by giving greater control to civil
society and grassroots movements.f It is estimated that more than 1.7 million people have participated in the biannual meetings of the
panchayats, including low-caste groups and women, both of whom have traditionally been marginalized.g Again, the success of the
decentralization programme in Kerala highlights the importance of real accountability of local governments to their citizens.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Citizen charters seek to ensure that citizens are consulted
and offered adequate information about the quantity and
quality of public services. Service delivery or user surveys
are an important source of information and have been promoted in many countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
With government support, the surveys aim to measure how
consumers or citizens feel about a range of services provided
by local and central governments. Results are disseminated
among civic groups and the print media and given to governments for action. The expectation is that governments
will improve their performance based on the survey ﬁndings.
One of the most advanced applications of this instrument
of accountability is the Public Affairs Centre’s Report Card,
pioneered in the Indian cities of Ahmedabad, Bangalore,
Calcutta, Madras and Pune,35 which solicits citizens’ views
on services such as telephones, electricity, water, health, the
postal system, public transport, the police, public banks and
food distribution systems.
Enforcement capacity also requires provision of adequate
remuneration to public-sector employees. One of the
attributes of developmental states in East Asia is their ability
to pay competitive salaries to their employees. In Singapore,
for instance, civil servants earn salaries that are superior to

those of employees in the private sector. However, the real
incomes of public servants in many low-income countries
have fallen sharply over the years. Table 10.3 shows that
pay declined somewhat as a proportion of per capita GDP
in developing countries as a whole between the early 1980s
and early 1990s. The ratio of the average central government wage bill to per capita GDP is estimated to have fallen
in Africa from 6.1 per cent in the early 1980s to 4.8 per
cent in the early 1990s; in Latin America it fell from 2.7 per
cent to 2.3 per cent; and in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from
1.7 per cent to 1.6 per cent. The data for Asia show an increase
from 2.9 per cent to 3.8 per cent over the same period. The
IMF reports that during the 1990s, real wages declined in
half of the countries with an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, although a few countries, such as Bolivia and
Uganda, showed increases. The complex ways in which many
public servants have responded to the pay crisis – diverting
time and resources to private ends and sideline activities in
the informal economy – have further eroded the administrative capacities of these states.36 The effects on employees at
the service delivery end of the bureaucracy, such as teachers
and nurses, have been most telling, provoking mass migration
from the public sector or a weakening of the public ethic.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 10 – BUILDING STATE CAPACITY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

Governments have addressed the pay crisis partly through
retrenchment in order to be able to pay living wages to
the remaining small number of employees, as well as to
offer attractive salaries to senior ofﬁcials. Often these
reforms have not positively affected employees at the
lower strata of the public service or those responsible for
delivering services – such as health care and education –
directly to the poor. They may create some measure of
professionalism in the upper echelons of a bureaucracy,
while the lower end may remain mired in inefﬁciencies.
Typically, the overall effect is to constrain the capacity of
bosses who are well remunerated at the top to translate
their policies into real outcomes.

Figure 10.2 summarizes the major links on which this
market-enhancing governance agenda is based.

2. Market-Enhancing
Institutional Reforms
The state’s role in promoting development came under sustained attack during the 1980s and 1990s, as some regions
experienced crises and turned to the IFIs for help. Under
the prescribed SAPs, governments were forced to liberalize their economies, privatize state-owned enterprises
and reduce the size and role of the state in the economy.
The following sections discuss the potential and limits of
three sets of institutional reforms that came to dominate
the policy agenda: good governance, managerial reforms
(New Public Management) and decentralization.

The link between good governance
and growth is weak
Governance reform now occupies a central position in
international development strategies.37 With the failure of
structural adjustment to deliver growth and reduce poverty
in the 1980s, a new focus emerged in the 1990s on the types
of governance capabilities needed by states to promote efﬁcient market economies. These emphasize enforcement of
property rights and the rule of law, as well as a reduction
in corruption and a commitment not to appropriate assets.

Notes: Link 1 claims that economic stagnation is ultimately due to hightransaction-cost markets or market failures (North 1990). Link 2 highlights
the underlying causes of market failure, which are weak property rights, rule
of law and arbitrary interventions (North 1990; Knack and Keefer 1995; Kauffman et al. 1999; Acemoglu et al. 2004). Instead of addressing market failures
individually, it focuses on making markets across the board more efﬁcient.
The assumption here is that markets are essentially systems of contracts;
market failure will follow by deﬁnition if the absence of clear expectations and
rights prevents contracting. Link 3 states that unstable property rights, poor
rule of law and expropriation by states occur because small groups engage
in rent seeking and corruption (Krueger 1974; Olson 1982; Mauro 1997). Link
4 asserts that these small groups can proﬁt at the expense of the majority because government accountability is weak or non-existent (North 1990;
Olson 2000). Link 5 completes the cycle because economic stagnation can,
in turn, prevent the poor from mobilizing and enable autocracy to continue.

Many of these governance goals are desirable, and civic
groups have often pressured public authorities to provide
or respect them. The key issue is whether they can form
the basis of a poverty reduction and development agenda.
While growth is likely to be more rapid if markets mediating
resource allocation are efﬁcient, a key question is whether
maximizing the efﬁciency of markets is sufﬁcient to maximize the pace of development. In East Asia and other regions
with effective states, governance capacities typically did not
focus on the capacities needed for ensuring efﬁcient markets. In fact, in terms of the market-enhancing conditions
prioritized by the good governance approach, East Asian
states performed poorly. Instead, they had effective institutions that could accelerate growth in conditions of technological backwardness and imperfect markets. Developing
countries do not generally satisfy the market-enhancing

273

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

governance criteria at early stages of development, even
in high-growth cases. This applies also to now-developed
countries at the early stages of their development.38

Many governance goals are desirable;
the key issue is whether they can form
the basis of a poverty reduction and
development agenda

Empirical tests carried out by Khan39 on each of the good
governance indicators – property rights, regulatory quality,
corruption, and voice and accountability – demonstrate
that the role of market-enhancing governance conditions
in explaining differences in growth rates in developing
countries is weak. Countries are divided into three groups:
advanced, converging and diverging. Advanced countries are members of the OECD; converging countries are
those whose per capita GDP growth rate is higher than the
median advanced country rate; and diverging countries are

those whose per capita GDP growth rate is lower than the
median growth rate of the advanced country group.
Table 10.4 and ﬁgure 10.3 report the ﬁndings for property
rights. They show that there is no signiﬁcant difference in
the median property rights index between converging and
diverging developing countries. The absence of any clear
separation between these groups of developing countries
also applies to the other indicators of good governance not
reported here. The very weak, albeit positive, relationship
between good governance and growth in many econometric studies depends to a great extent on a large number of
advanced countries having high scores on market-enhancing governance (the countries represented by diamonds in
ﬁgure 10.3) and the majority of developing countries being
low-growth and low-scoring on market-enhancing governance (the countries represented by triangles in the same
ﬁgure). However, market-enhancing governance is likely
to improve in countries with high per capita incomes. The
critical countries for establishing the direction of causality
are the converging developing countries (the countries represented by squares in the same ﬁgure). By and large, these
countries do not have signiﬁcantly better market-enhancing
governance scores than diverging developing countries.

The policy implications are important.40 Given the large
degree of overlap in the market-enhancing governance
scores achieved by converging and diverging developing countries, there is a need to qualify the claim that an
improvement in market-enhancing governance quality in
diverging countries will lead to a signiﬁcant improvement
in their growth performance. Nevertheless, the signiﬁcant
differences in the growth rates of converging and diverging
countries suggest signiﬁcant differences in the efﬁciency of
resource allocation and use among these countries. And
these differences are very likely related to signiﬁcant differences in other types of governance capabilities ignored by
the good governance agenda.

The good governance agenda overlooks
many important governance capabilities
It is also important to note that most of the indicators of
good governance are based on perceptions rather than on
direct observation. Nor do they throw much light on how
countries differ in terms of political, bureaucratic, resource
mobilization and enforcement capacity – all key issues in
understanding developmental state capacity.

Market-enhancing managerial reforms were
part of a second wave of reforms
A second set of reforms focus on improving the management of the state.41 Prior to the 1980s, reform strategies in
most developing countries were concerned with strengthening Weberian-style public administration systems.
These tended to be characterized by meritocratic systems
of recruitment, promotion and performance monitoring.
The triumph of neoliberalism led to calls for public management reforms to incorporate private sector techniques
in the delivery of basic services. Market-enhancing managerial reforms, known as New Public Management, ﬁrst
emerged in New Zealand and the United Kingdom in the
1980s. Starting in the mid-1980s, governments of low- and
middle-income countries around the world began adopting such reforms in response to pressure from the IMF and
World Bank, and the inﬂuence of some bilateral donors.

The triumph of neoliberalism led to
calls for public management reforms
to incorporate private sector techniques
in the delivery of basic services
The argument for the new managerial focus rests on two
key ideas derived from public choice and principal-agent
theories. According to public choice theory, bureaucrats
are exclusively motivated by self-interest (rent seeking),
rather than the public good assumed by Weberian principles of public administration. This leads to sets of proposed reforms aimed at overcoming rent-seeking behaviour
inside the state apparatus. The ﬁrst set of reforms involves a
change in public sector employment practices – from career
tenure towards a preference for limited-term contracts for
senior staff, locally determined pay rather than uniform
ﬁxed salaries, and the introduction of performance-related
pay. The second involves marketizing service provision –
through instruments such as contracting out, franchising,
developing internal markets, vouchers and user charges or
fees – to promote efﬁciency in service delivery and to give

275

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

choice and voice to users of public services. The resulting
competition among service providers is intended to promote cost-savings and responsiveness to customers. There
is also an emphasis on the quality of service provision,
which aims to make public services more demand- rather
than supply-driven.

the United States. By 2007, for instance, 75 per cent of the
United Kingdom’s civil service was employed in executive
agencies. In contrast, the public sectors of societies with
coordinated market economies in Continental Europe have
been more resistant to the introduction of such reforms.

The inﬂuence of principal-agent theory is seen in the case
made for the reassignment of roles to the different actors
involved in the process of service delivery. It involves a
split between the purchaser (the central ministry) and the
providers (the rest, either in the public or private sector).
When service delivery is retained within the public sector,
this entails breaking up large bureaucracies by means of disaggregating functions. A distinction is made between the
strategic policy core within a ministry (the principal) and
the operational arms of ministries that are separated off to
form individual executive agencies (the agents). Executive
agencies have four major characteristics that distinguish
them from a traditional uniﬁed bureaucracy: decentralized
management and associated ﬁnancial autonomy, specialization for speciﬁc operational tasks, a focus on outputs, and
performance-related contracts. Each agency is no longer
related to the parent ministry through the traditional
departmental hierarchy, but by an arm’s-length performance agreement of a contractual nature that has speciﬁed
performance targets. In cases in which service delivery is
transferred to the private sector, this involves a contractual
agreement between the central ministry (the principal)
and the private service deliverer (the agent).

The New Public Management
toolbox became a major example
of policy transfer in the ﬁeld
of public management

The global spread and impact of New Public
Management reforms
Market-enhancing managerial reforms were a central
feature of a second wave of reforms associated with the
Washington consensus and structural adjustment. The
New Public Management toolbox became a major example of policy transfer in the ﬁeld of public management.
However, the evidence suggests that the global spread of
these reforms has been uneven and patchy. They have been
more prominent in liberal market-driven policy regimes,
such as the Anglo-Saxon societies of Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent,

276

In Latin America, attempts to introduce managerial
reforms have proved to be unsustainable, despite a series of
initiatives in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. In Africa, the
adoption of managerial reforms reﬂects countries’ relations
with principal donors, with less support for these reforms in
Francophone countries and more in countries with closer
ties to the United Kingdom. In the United Republic of
Tanzania, for instance, the 1997 Executive Agencies Act
provided the framework for the creation of executive agencies modelled on those of the United Kingdom. Driven
from the heart of government by the Civil Service Department, it envisaged the creation of 46 executive agencies
by 2004. By 2001, only nine agencies had been created.
Ironically, the slow implementation of the programme was
attributed to its capture by the bureaucracy, which viewed
it primarily as a mechanism to respond to donor pressure,
led by the IMF, to downsize the civil service while raising
real incomes of senior staff. Between 1992 and 2000, public sector employment in that country fell by 27 per cent
– from 355,000 to 260,000. “Agenciﬁcation” contributed
considerably to that decline, with agencies reporting a drop
in their staff numbers from 20 per cent to 50 per cent.42
In general, the global spread of the complete set of New Public
Management–type reforms has been limited. Instead, reforms
in most low- and middle-income countries remain primarily focused on establishing the core features of a Weberian
bureaucracy. Implementing market-enhancing managerial
reforms is especially challenging in countries where markets

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 10 – BUILDING STATE CAPACITY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

for the delivery of services are highly imperfect and where
the danger of regulatory capture by powerful groups is likely.
For such reforms to succeed, they require good monitoring,
inspection and information systems, sound budgetary control
systems, development of reliable performance indicators and
measurements, and the capacity to regulate the behaviour of
private providers, as well as to manage relations among central ministries and a multitude of decentralized agencies.43
Instead of improving public management performance, New
Public Management–type reforms risk increasing the core
problems of administrative coordination and corruption.
They also tend to undermine the ethic of public service, a
problem that is acute in health systems of developing countries that have been commercialized.44 These problems suggest
that Weberian-style “old” public administration must ﬁrst be
created before introducing New Public Management. As box
10.3 shows, some developmental states (Singapore and the

Republic of Korea) have introduced features of New Public
Management in their state systems, but they ﬁrst established
effective Weberian bureaucracies.
One study45 examined the impact of managerial reforms on
government in four core sectors (urban water, agricultural
marketing, basic health and business development) in four
developing countries (Ghana, India, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe). It identiﬁed a number of constraints on governments’
capacities to perform new managerial roles. It concluded that
the new managerial approaches – regulating markets, enabling
other providers, managing service delivery through decentralized structures, contracting out and charging users – are more
complex and taxing on government capacity than previous
systems. Often, it was basic administrative failures (record
keeping, ﬁnancial control, enforcement of sanctions and
clarity of authority relations) that undermined performance.

BOX 10.3: Managerial reforms in developmental states: Singapore and the Republic of Korea
The experience of Singapore provides support for the argument that a functioning Weberian bureaucracy provides the best basis for
introducing New Public Management. Although a classic developmental state, Singapore has carried out managerial reforms, known as
PS21 (Public Service for the 21st Century), since 1989. These reforms were introduced on the basis of an existing public administration
system that was already characterized by meritocracy, high status and professional ethics among the senior cadre of the civil service,
and an uncompromising attitude towards corruption.a Executive agencies now cover the bulk of the civil service, personnel functions
such as recruitment and promotion have been delegated to individual ministries, and a culture of service excellence in meeting the
needs of the public with high standards of quality and courtesy has been nurtured.b
Nevertheless, Singapore remains wedded to a state-directed system of governance via a wide range of recently corporatized utilities
and other publicly owned bodies. The selective introduction of New Public Management reforms has not sought “to reduce the role and
importance of the state as such, but has rather been aimed at maintaining the same strong administrative state by means of reﬁning
its role to keep it in step with the latest developments and future challenges”.c Clearly, Singapore is experimenting with New Public
Management in a manner akin to the neo-Weberian state approach found in Germany.
Since the 1997 ﬁnancial crisis in Asia, the Republic of Korea has also experimented with managerial reforms inspired by the New
Public Management paradigm. Under the Kim Dae-jung administration (1998–2003), the Civil Service Commission established an
open position system to attract talented candidates from outside government to 20 per cent of the posts in the top three grades of
the civil service. It also introduced performance-related pay for senior managers. Most government agencies and public enterprises
adopted service charters and introduced a Public Customer Satisfaction Index. By December 2005, there were 23 executive agencies
in operation reporting to 16 different ministries. However, there has been widespread informal resistance to the implementation of
these reforms, considerably restricting managerial autonomy in executive agencies.d

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Resort to user charges without exemptions for those with
limited ability to pay also produced undesirable outcomes.

The effects of New Public Management
reforms on developmental states
New Public Management reforms may, in fact, be counterproductive to the building of developmental states by
thwarting the need for a uniﬁed and coherent bureaucracy,
high-level strategic planning and trust-based relations with
the private sector. The reforms have an innately static
quality in promoting development. For example, they rely
on competition to improve efﬁciency, equity and effectiveness, rather than more dynamic means, such as providing
incentives for expanding the productive base and technological level of the economy. Concern for these issues
is only indirect, based on the view that improvement in
the allocation of public sector resources can encourage
dynamism by the private sector. This distant relationship
between the actions of the state and the wider process of
economic transformation is in sharp contrast to the interventionist nature of the developmental state, which has an
explicit interest in dynamic change.
This difference between the static New Public Management
approach and the dynamic approach of the developmental
state comes sharply into focus in education. Here, a notable
feature of the developmental state has been the priority it
attaches to qualitative change in promoting technical and
scientiﬁc education, which seeks to transfer and root technological advances from the global economy to the domestic arena. By contrast, the more quantitative approach of
New Public Management–type reforms has prioritized the
use of blunt and general indicators, such as classroom size,
teacher qualiﬁcation levels, school autonomy and examination results – important issues that have been detached
from the larger goal of economic and social transformation.
The promotion of high-quality university education is a
major feature of the developmental state, and this has had
a positive impact on strengthening the professionalism and
esprit de corps of the core civil service.
Even in the United Kingdom, there has been concern with
the negative effect that agenciﬁcation is having on the

278

capacity of the state for strategic planning. In the words of
one observer, “So many experts have moved into management in the agencies that there are too few civil servants
involved in policy making. Core Whitehall departments
are in danger of becoming departments of administrators
rather than policy makers”.46 This poses an even greater
danger in low- and middle-income countries where the
strategic capacity of the state is much weaker.
The managerialist and the developmental state perspectives differ fundamentally in the nature of the relationship
between central government and other actors in the development process. Under the New Public Management paradigm, the strategic role of the state is facilitated by distanced
principal-agent relationships of a contractual nature with
other major actors. Contracting out involves an arm’s-length
relationship between the state as purchaser (principal) and
the private company as provider (agent). This institutional
rearrangement for service delivery is essentially adversarial
in nature. It often introduces a semi-autonomous regulatory body to arbitrate over contractual disputes with the
regulator acting as a sort of referee. On the other hand, the
developmental state advocates a much closer, discretionary
and ﬂexible relationship with the private sector, one that is
essentially based on a complex web of trust and coercion.
In the urban water sector, where New Public Management–
type contractual arrangements have been introduced in
many low- and middle- income countries, there is a growing recognition of the failure of this adversarial relationship,
focused exclusively on the contract, to deal with the multiplicity of conﬂicts that can arise during the long time period
(up to 25 years) of such contracts. In France, there has long
been recognition that a legal contract can never incorporate all possible conﬂicts that may arise in the future; thus,
relational or trust-based contracting has become the norm.

Progress in decentralization is uneven
Decentralization features prominently on donor agendas
for public management reforms. It is also a feature of good
governance. It seeks to reduce rent-seeking behaviour and
inefﬁcient resource allocation associated with centralized

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 10 – BUILDING STATE CAPACITY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

power by dispersing such power to lower levels of government, where the poor are likely to exercise inﬂuence and
a variety of actors may participate in the provision of services. The key services affected by decentralization are public works, education, health, sanitation, waste management
and water. However, decentralization also has a political
imperative, since it is linked to processes of democratization in which citizens demand more involvement in the
way the public space is governed. It can also be used as a
tool to resolve conﬂicts in deeply divided societies.
Decentralization is more entrenched in advanced democracies than in developing countries. In the 1980s, local governments in OECD countries accounted for, on average,
11 per cent of public employment, reaching 25 per cent in
some countries. In contrast, local government in developing
countries accounted for an average of 4.5 per cent of public
employment, ranging from 2.5 per cent in Africa to 8 per
cent in Asia. Data from the late 1980s and early 1990s indicate that the local government share of total government
spending averaged around 32 per cent in OECD countries,
compared to 15 per cent in the developing world. Decentralization expenditure ratios are even higher in countries
such as Denmark (45 per cent) and Finland (41 per cent).
Current data suggest that the gap is narrowing, but is
still substantial.47
Democratization in most low- and middle-income countries has been accompanied by some form of decentralization. However, the extent and quality of decentralization is
uneven. In many countries, what passes for decentralization
is simply deconcentration, that is, the delegation of administrative authority to ﬁeld units of the same department.
Some central authorities have been willing to devolve
administrative powers to local authorities but retain ﬁscal control. In Kenya, the Local Government Act imposes
strong constraints on local authorities, which cannot make
substantive decisions without approval from the Ministry of Local Government.48 A comparative study of Côte
d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda49 found
greater willingness to transfer responsibilities than ﬁnancial
powers. In general, commercial cities or state capitals enjoy
more ﬁscal capacity than small town and village councils,

which may not function without ﬁnancial support from the
central state. On the other hand, decentralization, including transfer of ﬁscal responsibilities, has progressed in more
established democracies, especially middle-income countries (in Latin America, South Africa and European Union
members in Eastern and Central Europe), even if outcomes
vary in terms of capacity and service delivery.

The potential and limits of decentralization
Decentralization raises a number of problems for developmental state strategies and equity. It can complicate strategic planning and lead to a reduction in the meritocratic
basis for civil service recruitment, especially in countries
where the independence of the central public service commission is already limited. An additional problem is interregional redistribution, which cannot be effected in a highly
decentralized system with substantial disparities in ﬁscal
capacity across local governments. This can be a serious
problem in highly unequal societies. The responsibility for
interregional redistribution should always rest with the central government through the pursuit of appropriate national
tax, transfer and expenditure policies. Interregional disparities have worsened in some East Asian countries that have
decentralized.50 In addition, many low-income countries
are characterized by weak state capacity, which is likely
to be particularly accentuated at local levels and in poor
regions. Decentralization that is unsupported by capacitybuilding programmes may simply reproduce or intensify the
inefﬁciencies of the central state at the local level. A lack
of administrative capacity may lead to an increase in corruption and elite capture of decentralization.
However, some democracies with decentralized structures have been successful in promoting development and
redistribution. As decentralization takes root in low- and
middle-income democracies, it may be difﬁcult to reverse
it and adopt more centralized arrangements associated with
successful developmental states. The challenge is how to
improve upon the quality of decentralization and democratization. National compacts and coordination mechanisms
may be required in decentralized polities to ensure that
growth-oriented and redistributive strategies pursued at the
central level of government are supported, or at least not

279

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

undermined, across jurisdictions. Box 10.2 discusses three
cases of successful decentralization – in the city of Porto
Alegre, Brazil, and the Indian states of Kerala and West
Bengal. They suggest that the impact of decentralization
on poverty outcomes may be positive in contexts where
governing elites seek to change local power structures in
favour of low-income groups, and where there is a network
of civil society groups that can engage local authorities in
policy making. In situations where local elites are deeply
patriarchal or oligarchic, decentralization may produce
undesirable outcomes.

3. Building State Capacity
for Structural Change
and Poverty Reduction:
Implications for Policy
Poverty reduction requires effective states that are both
developmental and redistributive. Countries that have
reduced poverty in relatively short periods of time had purposeful, growth-oriented and welfare-enhancing political
systems; they also built and maintained competent bureaucracies. Successful developmental states often lacked the
appropriate bureaucracies when they embarked on their
development path. They subsequently built them.51 As this
chapter has shown, building state capacity for structural
change and poverty reduction requires a focus on three crucial dimensions: the building of political coalitions needed
to set and carry out policy; the mobilization of resources
with which to implement development objectives; and
the ability to allocate resources to productive and welfareenhancing sectors, and enforce rules governing their use.
Strategies for constructing these three dimensions of state
capacity differ in authoritarian and democratic regimes.
Authoritarian strategies are top-down, whereas democracies may be forced to engage citizens more actively in the
building of capacity. Authoritarian strategies were lauded
in much of the development literature in the 1960s as a
necessary condition to accelerate the growth process,

280

achieve modernization, and build nation-states out of complex ethnic cleavages and loyalties that tended to undermine stability and cohesion. Yet authoritarian strategies of
state building in most countries turned out to be unstable
and non-developmental, and provoked pressures for democratization. A few countries, largely those in East Asia, did
succeed in transforming their economies and breaking out
of poverty in a sustained way. This chapter has shown that
even for these authoritarian developmental states, coercion alone was not sufﬁcient in constructing effective state
capacity. Rather, they share with democratic developmental states an ability to provide wide-ranging and good quality services to broad sections of the populace. This suggests
that the developmental outcomes that deﬁne successful
authoritarian regimes can be achieved without recourse to
authoritarian practices, which ultimately become unsustainable. Moreover, democracy is now accepted as a core
value of the international community, and strategies for
developing state capacity should therefore be grounded in
democratic principles.

Forge political settlements
for redistribution
Democratic societies that are committed to structural change
and poverty reduction must forge political settlements that
allow the political leadership to design public policies and
to create the necessary bureaucracies to implement them.
Social transfers or redistributions are an indispensable part
of such settlements. Both the political base and the organizational effectiveness of governmental power are variables
that help explain differences in state capacity and success in
poverty reduction strategies. States with a broad power base,
well-organized ruling parties, competent bureaucracies and
an activist citizenry have effectively implemented redistributive policies.52 This underscores the importance of redistributing social and political power in favour of subaltern groups
in order to build bureaucratic capacities that support both
growth and redistribution. The active inclusion of subaltern
groups in the political process can empower states to overcome pressures from dominant groups, which often resist
policies that are oriented towards redistribution.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 10 – BUILDING STATE CAPACITY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

Improve domestic resource mobilization
and encourage citizen involvement in the
allocation and monitoring of resources
This chapter has also shown that high levels of domestic
resource mobilization are necessary for state capacity. Governments must aim to improve their domestic revenue base in
order to have more policy space and be able to set agendas,
strengthen their links with citizens, and inﬂuence the orientation and strategies of business groups and service providers.
Governments must also be able to enforce decisions about
resource use. What distinguishes successful from unsuccessful states in directing development is the latter’s failure to
generate governance capacities to enforce rules on how the
resources allocated are used and construct mutually supportive
state-society relations. Allocative and enforcement capacities
can be improved through citizen participation in regulating
development agents and service providers. But in order for this
to happen, governments must provide the necessary information and support that can help citizen groups to hold business agents and providers accountable. The participation of
informed citizens and non-state actors in monitoring resource
use can reduce the cost involved in enforcing policies.

Tackle the three dimensions of state capacity
directly rather than rely on good governance
reforms to improve delivery of services
Current approaches to state building have focused largely
on market-enhancing governance strategies of good governance, managerialism and decentralization. Aspects of these
strategies are desirable goals for all countries. However,
they should not be confused with the institutions required
for generating and sustaining growth and producing socially
equitable outcomes. Governments must focus directly on
building political, bureaucratic, resource mobilization and
enforcement capacity rather than expect such capacity to
emerge from implementation of good governance reforms.
As this chapter has shown, the large degree of overlap in
the good governance scores of converging and diverging
countries suggests that growth is not likely to be sustained
in poor countries by simply implementing market-enhancing

reforms. However, the high disparity in growth rates between
converging and diverging countries also suggests major differences in the efﬁciency of resource use, which may be due
to signiﬁcant differences in other types of governance capabilities ignored by the good governance agenda.

Create the foundations of a Weberian bureaucracy
to improve service delivery for the poor
Governments must aim to build the foundations of a Weberian bureaucracy before adopting more complex managerial
reforms. This is because managerial reforms that improve
service delivery to the poor require high levels of regulatory
capacity, which can be achieved when countries have succeeded in building modern bureaucracies. Market-enhancing
managerial reforms are complex and taxing on government
capacity. Bureaucratic capacity can be substantially improved
if governments address basic administrative failures, such as
record keeping, ﬁnancial control, enforcement of rules and
clarity of authority relations. Bureaucratic performance
in poverty reduction can also be improved if public sector
employees, especially those at the service delivery end of
the bureaucracy – teachers, nurses and extension workers –
receive adequate remuneration for their work.

Improve the quality of decentralization
by involving low-income groups in local
decision-making processes
For decentralization reforms to support effective delivery of
services to the poor, governments must commit to changing local power structures in favour of the poor, and allow
citizen groups to engage local authorities in policy-making
processes. Efforts should also be made to prevent decentralization from creating or reinforcing regional inequalities by
entrusting central governments with the responsibility for
interregional redistribution through pursuit of appropriate
national tax, transfer and expenditure policies. Governments
must also support capacity-building programmes to prevent
decentralization from simply reproducing or intensifying the
inefﬁciencies of the central state at the local level.

CHAPTER

Democracy and the Politics
of Poverty Reduction
The types of development strategies states pursue and
the possibilities for achieving a redistribution of income,
wealth and social beneﬁts depend substantially on politics. Politics refers to processes of cooperation, conﬂict and
negotiation that shape decisions about the production, distribution and use of resources. Outcomes from the political
process further depend on the way power is conﬁgured or
distributed, the types of relationships governments establish with different groups in society, and the institutions
that structure relations and mediate conﬂicts among competing interests. Organization, contestation and claimsmaking by groups with strong ties to the poor are crucial
in producing redistributive outcomes that reduce poverty.
However, interest groups or social movements concerned
with the welfare of the poor rarely organize around issues of
poverty per se. Instead, they frame their discourse around
rights, asset distribution, services, or earnings and beneﬁts
derived from work. This opens up the possibility of addressing the structural roots of poverty, social rights and issues
related to redistribution.
Even though poverty has been eradicated under certain types
of authoritarian rule, the aim of this chapter is to convey an
understanding of how it can be eliminated within a democratic context, given that democracy, rights, freedom and
choice are essential components of development.1 Although
democracies offer opportunities for participation and contestation in policy making, redistributive outcomes cannot be
taken for granted, given differences in the capacity of groups
to organize, contest and inﬂuence public policy in different
contexts. The challenge lies in forging democratic states that
are both developmental and socially inclusive.
Current democracies face two types of constraints. The ﬁrst,
underscored vividly by the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008–2009, is
the capture of economic policy by investors, ﬁnancial institutions and donors through various types of conditionality.

11

This has tended to favour stabilization and liberalization
policies that are detrimental to welfare-enhancing structural change. The second constraint relates to the limited
nature of industrial transformation in most new democracies, the uneven quality of their democratic institutions and
processes, and ethnic cleavages in many that shape choices
and capacity for collective action. All of these factors affect
the formation and growth of interest groups, social movements and parties necessary for holding leaders accountable
and for constructing pacts with redistributive agendas.

Although democracies offer
opportunities for participation
and contestation in policy making,
redistributive outcomes cannot
be taken for granted
Although the World Bank and IMF–led Poverty Reduction
Strategy Papers (PRSPs) support the participation of civil
society groups in programme design, the process has mostly
been reduced to consultation rather than participation to
effect real change. The type of participation associated
with the social pacts that produced rapid poverty reduction
in the past differs substantially from the bargaining regime
of the PRSPs, which relies heavily on non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), and where the balance of power is
strongly weighted against non-governmental groups.
This chapter shows that democracies have been able to
deliver outcomes that are beneﬁcial to the poor under
certain conditions – when:
• rights are institutionalized, which allows the
poor to exercise political choice, build alliances
with others and hold leaders to account;

283

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

• groups with strong ties to the poor develop
capacity for independent organization and
mobilization, transcend or reconcile horizontal
divisions, and establish structural links with
actors involved in policy making, leading,
at times, to social pacts. Some success can
be achieved without formal group ties to state
actors, but this usually requires high levels of
contestation and continuous mobilization to
sustain gains; and
• elections are competitive and there is a
high probability that governments may
lose ofﬁce, which can serve as an incentive
for redistribution. However, electoral
competitiveness without effective group
organization and contestation may produce
weak redistributive outcomes.
The poor suffer when interest groups and social movements
are weak and the electoral system is not sufﬁciently competitive. Technocratic styles of policy making – in which
macroeconomic policy is insulated from public scrutiny –
and aid conditionality also limit the scope for contestation
and effective participation of civic groups with redistributive agendas in the policy process.
Although growth and redistribution may at times appear to
be in conﬂict, they have been reconciled in industrialized
democracies when employment levels and rates of unionization are high, allowing unions to project an encompassing or national stance in bargaining that transcends narrow
union interest. In welfare democracies with lower levels of
industrialization, redistributive politics may also be encompassing or inclusive when groups forge rural-urban alliances
that incorporate wide segments of the working poor. Ruralurban alliances make it possible to extend welfare rights to
all categories of citizens. In such democracies, leading parties tend to embrace a discourse of social rights, and groups
engage the state as rights-bearing citizens rather than as
clients. Fiercely contested elections, sometimes leading to
changes in government, encourage parties to retain their
social movement characteristics, which are essential for
sustaining proactive links to the poor.

284

In sum, the chapter draws three main conclusions:
• Power relations are at the core of
development. Strategies that aim to reduce
poverty and inequality must also consider
ways to tip the balance of power.
• Although democracy tends to produce
redistributive outcomes, such outcomes should
not be taken for granted. Group activism of
various kinds – including voting power, bargaining
and direct action – is important in generating
shifts in power and ensuring that governments
respond to social needs.
• Reducing poverty requires an expansion of the
bargaining power of the poor and those who
represent them. This entails action on several
fronts: rejecting technocratic styles of decision
making, which limit the involvement of citizens
and their representatives in policy-making
processes; widening the participation of civil
society in the policy process; institutionalizing
civil and political rights to encourage broader
participation in policy making; and supporting
organizations that seek to protect the rights of
both formal and informal workers.
Section 1 of this chapter highlights recent trends in democratization and conceptualizes the links between democracy
and redistribution, including the roles of interest groups
and social movements in the politics of redistribution.
Section 2 discusses the constraints of technocratic styles of
governance and aid conditionality on policy space.
Section 3 examines three types of domestic constraints to pursuing redistributive policies: limited industrialization, the uneven quality of democratic institutions, and ethnic diversity.
Section 4 analyses the conditions under which democracies deliver redistributive outcomes by examining ﬁve cases
involving activism by interest groups and social movements.
Section 5 draws conclusions and spells out implications
for policy.

The 1980s and 1990s witnessed a strong wave of democratization that affected most regions of the world. This
was driven in part by societal pressures to force governments to correct the failed policies of growth and redistribution associated with structural adjustment (in Africa
and Latin America) and inefﬁcient central planning
(in Central and Eastern Europe), or to improve political and economic choices as economies matured (in East
Asia). Added pressure came from multilateral and bilateral
aid agencies, which expected that democratization would
compel governments to formulate and implement what
they perceived to be better economic policies and cut down
on corruption.

Over the past 25 years,
countries across all categories
of national income have held
competitive elections

There is a good deal of disagreement about the number
of countries that can be classiﬁed as democratic,
although all datasets point to a sharp increase in the last
25 years. Polity IV reports an increase from about
40 democratic countries in 1980 to more than 90 by 2006,
and a corresponding decrease in authoritarian regimes
from more than 80 to about 25 over the same period.
According to Freedom House, over 60 per cent of countries could be classiﬁed as democratic by 2000. Figure 11.1
indicates an increase in the number of low- and middleincome countries that held elections from 1975–2006 and
in those in which the winner received less than 75 per cent
of seats in the lower chamber. Interestingly, since the
mid-1990s, the number of countries holding competitive
elections has been evenly distributed among all categories
of national income.

Democracy tends to produce redistributive
outcomes, but is subject to group inﬂuences
Democracy is deﬁned as a system of government in which
leaders periodically renew their mandates through free, fair
and competitive elections. In addition, it is a system that
acknowledges a set of rights – such as those of expression,
organization and collective action – that allow citizens
to exercise political choice and hold leaders accountable.
Despite the centrality of elections in democracies, this
chapter argues that redistribution requires additional mechanisms of interest representation in the policy process.
A positive association between democracy and redistribution
is posited by the median-voter theorem. According to the
theorem, under universal suffrage, the median voter will earn
the median income. However, when income is unequally distributed, the median income falls below the mean income.
Redistribution is expected to follow democratization because
the mean income in pre-democratic societies is universally
higher than the income of the median voter. Since the decisive voter earns a below-average income, it is assumed that
he or she will favour a higher tax rate and redistributive

285

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

policies. In sum, democracy brings more people with belowaverage incomes to the polls, and they collectively press the
government to redistribute income downwards.2
This way of conceptualizing democracy and redistribution
is devoid of group inﬂuences, since it assumes that all voters earning incomes below the median are a homogenous
group that will automatically vote for redistribution. However, behaviour is shaped by other factors, including relationships in the workplace, by social and cultural settings,
and by the political environment. Voting itself is a collective action mediated by organized groups with competing preferences and requires concerted effort for effective
outcomes. It needs to be combined with other modes of
organization to affect redistributive outcomes.
In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the extension of the vote to non-propertied groups was strongly associated with redistribution. Democratization was contested by
the rich, who saw it as a process that would facilitate tax
increases by parliaments controlled by the rising workingclass majority.3 Indeed, studies suggest that social spending,
social programmes and taxation in major European countries
increased and inequalities declined after countries embarked
on democratization.4 These redistributive outcomes and subsequent expansion of welfare were, however, based on speciﬁc types of group action, as represented by union activism,
cross-class collective action, the strength of Leftist parties
and their participation in government.5 How individuals
organize into groups and affect public policy is therefore
important in understanding the politics of redistribution.

The organization of groups
Group organization may take three broad forms: as social
movements, as interest-based associations and networks,
and as political parties. Social movements emerge when
protests against speciﬁc issues are linked to other efforts to
address similar concerns and are sustained over time and
across different locations. They are often diffuse and may not
always be formally organized. Interest-based associations,
which may emerge from, or support, social movements,
include trade unions, farmers associations, professional and
business organizations, neighbourhood groups, women’s

286

organizations and advocacy groups. The politics of production-based interest associations have, in some contexts,
created a bargaining regime that places them ﬁrmly within
the institutions of policy making rather than as lobbyists
operating from the outside. Groups may combine voting
power, bargaining and direct action to improve welfare.

How individuals organize into
groups and affect public policy is
important in understanding the
politics of redistribution
Relatively few social movements or associations emerge
speciﬁcally around the issue of poverty.6 Rather, they tend
to focus on issues such as rights, asset protection or redistribution, access to services, or work-related earnings and
beneﬁts. However, the fact that movements emerge around
issues that drive poverty and address them through political action means that they have the effect of politicizing
poverty, placing it in its broader relational context. It also
means that in certain contexts, the processes that can serve
to deepen poverty might also serve to create the demand
for movements contesting these same processes. Social
movements may require interest-based associations to keep
them active and mobilized.
In advanced industrialized democracies, movements, associations and parties tended to cluster according to the basic
capital-labour cleavage associated with industrialization.7
Indeed, many political parties and interest associations were
a product of social movements.8 In developing country contexts, the three forms of organization do not cluster according
to the basic industrial cleavage, although social movements
and interest-based associations have provided a foundational
base for parties that have embraced redistributive policies.
Current democracies face certain external and domestic
constraints in pursuing redistributive policies. The external
constraints have two dimensions. The ﬁrst involves pressure
by investors and ﬁnancial institutions to narrow economic

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 11 – DEMOCRACY AND THE POLITICS OF POVERTY REDUCTION

policy making to a limited set of market-enhancing objectives, which elected governments and organized groups ﬁnd
difﬁcult to challenge even when they participate in deﬁning poverty reduction strategies. The second relates to the
power of bilateral donors in the policy-making systems of
aid-dependent democracies exercised through various types
of conditionality. Both constraints limit policy space for
alternatives. The domestic constraints relate to the nature
of industrial transformation and restructuring, the uneven
quality of institutions and processes, and ethnic divisions.
The next two sections describe these constraints before
discussing group activism for redistribution.

2. External Constraints to
Pursuing Redistributive Policies
Welfare states were formed when governments enjoyed relative autonomy in using ﬁscal and monetary instruments to
compensate losers for external shocks and facilitate redistribution as economies grew. However, current patterns of globalization exert pressure for cuts in social expenditures and taxes
and for more restrictive monetary policies. Firms in tradable
sectors often pressure governments to lower taxes and reduce
budget deﬁcits, and they perceive social programmes as additional costs that will undermine international competitiveness. Similarly, capital mobility gives ﬁrms, especially those in
the ﬁnancial sector, the freedom to shift funds around or punish governments that pursue ﬁscal policies that are inconsistent with business interests. In some countries, the structural
change associated with liberalization has weakened ﬁrms that
enjoyed a good deal of protection under import-substituting
industrialization, including the social actors and welfare entitlements that underpinned such a regime.9

Government capture by technocrats insulates
decisions from the will of the people
Although the actual effects of globalization on welfare spending and outcomes are still being debated,10 governments

are under considerable pressure to limit policy options to
a narrow set of objectives that emphasize ﬁscal restraint,
privatization and liberalization. In order to meet these
objectives, governments often prefer to limit policy making to technocrats, or those with expertise, whose decisions are insulated from political processes. This, in effect,
renders parliaments and social groups ineffective players in
the policy-making process. Technocrats are mostly found
in central banks and ﬁnance and trade ministries, which
are integrated into global ﬁnancial and trade systems and
increasingly adopt a less developmental and redistributive
stance in policy making. They have gained strength at the
expense of social and production-sector ministries.
Technocratic styles of policy making distort structures of
accountability since governments tend to answer more
to multilateral agencies and investors than to representative institutions and the wider public. This affects the way
governments respond to issues of employment and social
policies, which may be sidelined or forced to conform to
predetermined policy objectives that emphasize ﬁscal stability. In democracies, legislative institutions are expected
to articulate the choices of citizens, scrutinize government
policies and provide legitimacy for policy outcomes. But
economic policies affect social groups and institutions
differently, and democratic processes and accountability suffer when important decisions about trade-offs are
entrusted exclusively to technocrats. Central bank chiefs,
for instance, whose institutions now enjoy a good deal of
autonomy in new democracies, may be beholden to special-interest groups in the ﬁnancial world. This may give
added privilege to strategies for reducing inﬂation, as well
as ﬁnancial and trade liberalization, over those of generating employment or more inclusive social policies.
UNRISD research11 suggests that countries that are
dependent on multilateral ﬁnancial institutions show high
levels of policy capture by these institutions. Those with
a longer history of democracy in which policy making
reﬂects compromises between politicians and citizens have
pursued more heterodox policies. In some cases, the rise of
technocratic behaviour in the executive branch can serve
as an incentive for legislators to become more technically

287

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

competent. This may check the growth of technocracy if
it is accompanied by improved levels of accountability to
citizens, and if the latter also become more aware of the
technical issues involved in policy making.
Relations between the executive and legislative branches
in the economic policy ﬁeld in low-income democracies are
often lopsided, a problem that is compounded by the lack of
expertise of most legislators. For instance, more than 60 per
cent of members in Malawi’s ﬁrst democratically elected parliament had qualiﬁcations below a college diploma, and only
about 15 per cent had a ﬁrst degree or more. While donor
interventions have strengthened the technical knowledge
of the executive branch, those of the legislature remain
severely underdeveloped, making it difﬁcult for lawmakers
to properly represent the interests of their constituents and
hold the executive branch to account. In many aid-dependent countries, multilateral ﬁnancial institutions have played
important roles in identifying, supporting and recruiting
technocrats for vital economic institutions. In Malawi during the 1990s, tensions existed between the government’s
views on poverty alleviation and the demands of its structural adjustment programme (SAP). The poverty alleviation programme launched in 1995 was never implemented
because of the subsequent introduction of cash budgeting,
the need to control expenditures, and the transfer of the
technical staff entrusted with implementing the poverty
alleviation programme from the National Economic Council
to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.
If a democratic transition is preceded by an authoritarian regime with success in delivering some economic
outcomes, or one that has imposed restrictions on radical
constitutional change, as in Chile in the 1990s, the new
government may be forced to accept the former regime’s
policy-making parameters, limiting the extent to which
redistributive policies can be pursued. Elite consensus
on economic policies may also emerge if past approaches
to policy making are discredited, and parties and voters
demand a new beginning. In the Czech Republic and Hungary, widespread distrust of central planning, along with
strong faith in the market and membership in the European Union as vehicles for reversing economic decline,

288

served to bring elites together across the political spectrum
during the transition period. Parliamentary oversight of
the executive branch mainly entailed acquiring information about the branch’s activities rather than contesting its
policy choices. In Hungary, the consensus broke down in
1995 following a hard-hitting stabilization programme that
led to party splits and intense parliamentary debates on the
budget. In the Czech Republic, the crisis in 1996–1998 led
to government criticism of the central bank’s monetary policy. When the government later collapsed, it was replaced
by a caretaker administration headed by the central bank
governor. Parliamentary oversight of the executive branch
improved when a new parliament was constituted in which
no party had a majority.

Strengthening the accountability of parliaments
Parliamentary accountability can be enhanced when ruling
parties engage in critical support of government policies –
rather than rubber-stamping them – and opposition parties
develop expertise in bargaining with the executive branch
and dispense with strategies of non-cooperation. A technocratically inclined executive cannot be held accountable if
the legislative branch lacks comparable levels of technical
expertise. And if parties fail to strengthen members’ technical capacity, their parliaments will remain equally uninterested in doing so. Until the early 1990s, very few efforts
were made by the president of Argentina to consult parliament, and a record number of decrees were used to push
through tough reforms that affected welfare adversely. The
rise of technocracy in the executive branch coincided with
a decline in the operational budget, staff size and competence of the parliament. Unable to scrutinize the executive
on the basis of the technical merits of policy, opposition
parties in parliament adopted strategies of non-cooperation.
However, the technical knowledge and expertise of parliament improved between 1995 and 1997,12 when it emulated
the executive branch by incorporating more legislators who
had been trained as economists. Subsequently, there was
more willingness to question the executive, introduce bills
and modify government-proposed legislation. In Chile, the
number of economist-legislators has grown dramatically
since the 1990s, and by 2000 they dominated the ﬁnance
committees of both the Senate and Chamber of Deputies.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 11 – DEMOCRACY AND THE POLITICS OF POVERTY REDUCTION

These economists have played an important role in moderating executive dominance in economic policy. However,
parliament still lacks sufﬁcient expertise, information and
resources to scrutinize all economic policies.
One of the issues that has been raised with respect to the
inability of women legislators (brought into parliament
through quotas) to defend women’s issues in public policies

relates to their frequent lack of technical expertise, especially with respect to economic and ﬁscal policies. However,
efforts are being made by some women parliamentarians (in
South Africa, for example) to use their expertise in gender
budgeting to strengthen their work. Box 11.1 discusses the
extent to which women in India and South Africa have
been able to use their presence in parliament to bring the
issue of gender equality into policy making.

BOX 11.1: Translating women’s political representation into outcomes that promote equality
Indicators of women’s political empowerment have improved considerably since the advent of democratization. Starting in the
1970s, the creation of gender machineries fostered the idea of women as a constituency for policy makers to consider. More recently,
deliberate strategies such as quotas and reserved seats have facilitated women’s political access to parliaments. South Africa, for
example, has adopted national and local quotas, leading to signiﬁcant increases in women’s political representation. India has resisted
national quotas, but does have a system of reserved seats that is being implemented at the local level of panchayats. At the national
level, female representation remains below 8 per cent despite 60 years of democracy. At the local level, the introduction of reserved
seats triggered dramatic results, with nearly one million women entering representative institutions in the ﬁrst round of panchayat
elections (1994 and 1995).

Yet, while women have gained signiﬁcant access to state bureaucracies and legislatures, institutional access has not automatically
translated into political voice, and voice has not led to redistributive policy outcomes. Whether or not women’s inclusion in representative
institutions leads to public policy that enhances equality depends on the overall political context. Three factors warrant mention.
• The design of institutions has a bearing on whether citizens are able to exercise control over spending of public resources.
Low levels of citizen control reduce incentives for participation and limit the potential for pro-poor decision making.
• Competitive electoral systems are more likely to create opportunities for women’s organizations to insert their claims on processes
of public deliberation by leveraging differences among political parties. Similarly, strongly institutionalized parties with a high
degree of legitimacy can be pre-eminent vehicles for policy inﬂuence. Where parties are closed systems of patronage, the inclusion
of women on party lists will have little effect on policy outcomes.
• Civil society plays a crucial role in ensuring legitimacy for women political representatives and holding elected leaders accountable.
The presence and autonomy of women’s organizations is thus an important variable for equality outcomes. Especially where women’s
organizations see their interventions as going beyond inclusion to encompass accountability, their impact on those institutions is
likely to be considerable. If they are successful in building accountability and shifting spending patterns, women’s organizations can
build trust in formal institutions. Without such trust, it is unlikely that poor women will expend much energy in articulating their
interests through the state and that quotas will kick-start long-term sustained participation.

In South Africa, the combination of a single-party-dominant political system, limited devolution of ﬁnancial decision making and a
weakly autonomous civil society has limited the impact of the large number of women who have been elected to political ofﬁce since
1994. In India, by contrast, stronger decentralization and deeper histories of independent organizations of women and poor people
have created political space for newly elected women to re-shape spending priorities.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

Aid conditionality limits the policy
options of governments
A second, related type of external constraint applies
mainly to aid-dependent democracies.13 Such democracies
are exposed to various types of conditionality and high levels of donor involvement in policy making, which limits
the space of national actors to shape development agendas. The most well-known, and criticized, is that of policy
conditionality, which multilateral donors deployed to push
through the SAPs of the 1980s. Under policy conditionality, recipients commit to certain policies before aid is
granted. Problems of national ownership and slippage in
implementation encouraged donors to turn to other aid
modalities, though not necessarily to abandon policy conditionality altogether.

donor involvement in policy making

Process conditionality
Process conditionality has gained inﬂuence as an alternative aid modality, along with democratization and donorﬁnanced poverty reduction strategies. Under this type of
conditionality, the policy-making process, rather than a
particular policy, is the subject of donor concern. It seeks
to change the balance of interests in policy making so
that the general population, especially groups that represent the poor, have a greater say. Process conditionality is
evident both in direct interactions between donors and
recipients, as well as in the PRSP process. It can be seen
as an effort to democratize economic policy making. However, the outcomes in most countries suggest that donor
inﬂuence has greatly increased through process conditionality, and the space for policy initiatives by national actors
has narrowed.

290

The PRSPs call for the participation of civil society groups
in their preparation, on the assumption that such participation will result in pro-poor policies. Considerable debate
has subsequently been focused on who is included in the
participatory process and their credentials as representatives of the poor. In practice, this role has usually been
taken on by NGOs, rather than associations of informal
and formal workers, farmers or artisans, whose livelihoods
are likely to be directly affected by the macroeconomic
policies favoured by donors. Research in many countries,
in fact, has found that important issues are often left out of
discussions. One common omission has been that of macroeconomic frameworks, which are largely based on the
International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility and negotiated between governments
and the IMF. As a result, the macroeconomic framework
that constitutes the foundation of a country’s development
strategy is subject to little or no debate. Moreover, though
countries are required to involve civil society groups in the
preparation of the PRSPs, there are no speciﬁc requirements
as to the form that involvement should take.14 Participants’
recommendations often do not affect the ﬁnal form of the
PRSPs, which depend on the approval of the international
ﬁnancial institutions (IFIs) for funding. In many cases,
civil society involvement is limited to taking part in consultations, rather than playing a more meaningful role
in inﬂuencing the actual content of policies. As described
in more detail in section 4, this form of participation
departs fundamentally from the bargaining regime historically associated with improvements in the welfare of
subaltern groups.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 11 – DEMOCRACY AND THE POLITICS OF POVERTY REDUCTION

Outcome-based conditionalities
Another type of conditionality that is gaining inﬂuence,
especially among bilateral donors, is aid selectivity. This
calls for aid allocation to be based on demonstrated success in policy implementation or achievement of development goals. The World Bank’s Assessing Aid report15 has
been extremely inﬂuential in this regard. It concludes that
aid can be effective in reducing poverty, but only in strong
institutional settings and when governments implement
“good” policies. It argues that rather than forcing governments to change their policies using policy conditionality,
donors should instead target poor countries that already
have relatively good governance records and that are
following favoured policies.

Aid selectivity can be linked to outcomes such as the
achievement of poverty reduction targets speciﬁed in the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This kind of outcome-based conditionality allows aid recipients greater freedom regarding what policies to pursue, as long as they keep
meeting development targets. This use of targets and outcomes is a feature of General Budget Support arrangements,
which seek to ensure that countries in receipt of unallocated
aid stay on track. It is also a feature of the HIPC-2 initiative
(for highly indebted poor countries), which requires preparation of a PRSP and a record of adherence to macroeconomic
policies deﬁned by the IFIs. The ﬁnal result, however, as the
case of Mozambique suggests (see box 11.2), is more intensive donor involvement in policy-making processes.

BOX 11.2: Aid dependence narrows policy options in Mozambique
One aid modality that has been found to be extremely inﬂuential in Mozambique is General Budget Support. Under this mechanism,
19 donors coordinate their activities with the government through the Group of Donors for Budget Support to Mozambique (known as
G19). The group holds regular meetings to discuss progress in the country, measured using a performance assessment framework,
which identiﬁes targets from Mozambique’s PRSP. This outcome-based conditionality is closely aligned with the MDGs and includes
targets on universal primary education, provision of basic health services and success in ﬁghting HIV/AIDS.

Mozambique has more donors supplying General Budget Support than any other country.a In fact, the funds generated through this
channel accounted for 27 per cent of aid to that country in 2004–2006. Not surprisingly, many observers have described the relationship
between donors and the government of Mozambique as highly unequal.

General Budget Support was intended to increase national ownership and limit the role of donors. However, in reality it has meant an
increase in donor involvement, with the entire policy process thrown open to donor inﬂuence. Communication between donors and
recipients at all levels of government is conducted on a daily basis. This has given donors the ability to inﬂuence policy from within.b
In addition, donor coordination has increased the power imbalance between donors and the government since all foreign aid rests on
their collective conditions.c

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

3. Domestic Constraints to
Pursuing Redistributive Policies
New democracies must also contend with a number of
domestic constraints to pursuing redistributive policies.
The ﬁrst is the limited nature of industrial transformation
and class formation. As table 11.1 shows, the labour force
characteristics of low- and middle-income countries differ substantially from those of high-income democracies.
Union density (meaning union membership as a percentage of the labour force) and coverage levels are also lower
in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income
democracies. A labour market structure that is dominated
by agriculture and micro-scale informal enterprises may act
as a constraint on the formation of interest group organizations and parties of the type that historically affected public
policies for redistribution. Recent trends in informalization
and subcontracting in large ﬁrms (see chapter 9) further
complicate the problem.
An additional constraint is the quality of democracy in
many newly democratized countries. Even though ﬁgure
11.1 suggests a rise in the number of elections for all coun-

try groupings, elections in many countries are of questionable quality, and rights are not fully institutionalized or
protected. Since 1990, more than 40 countries that have
held elections have been consistently classiﬁed as anocratic
– meaning, according to Polity IV, that they are not fully
democratic. Freedom House has also listed, on average,
more than 50 countries that are not fully free in its yearly
ratings of countries for the period 1990–2008. Many elections return incumbents to power and, especially in least
developed countries, parliaments are largely dominated by
single parties. Data on African parliaments for 2005 suggest that there was only one effective party in 21 countries.
In 15 parliaments, the largest party controlled 70 per cent
or more seats.16 The low quality of democratic transitions
suggests that voters may be unable to pressure leaders to
deliver on their promises, since the threat of losing ofﬁce
tends to be weak. Furthermore, the politics of most parties
in new democracies are not driven by programmes, making it difﬁcult to place them on a Left-Right axis.17 Governments rely less on parties for policy guidance and more
on the state bureaucracy, bilateral donors and multilateral
agencies. Parties are often elite creations for access to state
power, rather than instruments for aggregating voter preferences or the welfare interests of organized groups.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 11 – DEMOCRACY AND THE POLITICS OF POVERTY REDUCTION

Elections in many countries are of
questionable quality, and rights are not
fully institutionalized or protected
A third constraining factor is ethnicity. As ﬁgure 11.2 shows,
low- and middle-income countries are much more ethnically
diverse than high-income countries. A common assumption
is that the development of democracy, support for public
goods and welfare development more broadly rest on trust
and solidarity, which mainly thrive in societies with common
values.20 Observers contend that governments in ethnically
diverse societies underprovide public goods and redistribute
less for a number of reasons: because cross-cultural exchanges
are less common than exchanges among members of the same
group; differences exist in group preferences for distinct types
of public goods;21 inequalities among groups may encourage
individuals from richer groups to opt for private provision or
oppose redistribution; and it may be difﬁcult to apply social
sanctions or punishments across ethnic divides.22 This implies
that even if voters are well informed about public policies,
parties or politicians can only be credible to one segment of

the voting public at best. And, if parties seek to be credible
across ethnic divides, voters may be inﬂexible, rewarding only
parties that are perceived to be led by co-ethnics.

Observers contend that governments
in ethnically polarized societies tend
to underprovide public goods and
redistribute less
The ﬁrst scenario encourages targeted provisioning and
patronage politics. In the second, the vote loses its signiﬁcance as a sanctioning device against bad performance.
Politicians may then perceive the ethnic vote as a vote
bank that cannot be claimed by rival politicians or parties
from other groups. This may also affect the formation of
cross-ethnic interest group organizations and social movements or weaken the effectiveness of these groups when
they embark on collective action. However, as box 11.3
shows, these kinds of pathological outcomes are more likely
to occur in societies where the ethnic structure is polarized,
not in countries with high levels of ethnic fragmentation.

FIGURE 11.2: Ethnic, linguistic and religious
cleavages by income level

Fractionalization index

If parties are not programmatic and voters do not place
a premium on programmes in their voting preferences,
it is difﬁcult to hold leaders to account, and incumbents
have no incentive to translate promises into effective policies. The outcome is likely to be targeted provisioning.18
Since voters may not believe that any party is credible,
they may opt for individually targeted welfare or “electoral bribes” during election cycles. Targeted welfare may
include assistance with jobs, loans, cash and goods for
individual voters. While these may beneﬁt some individuals, they release leaders from the obligation to provide services that will beneﬁt the majority. It is not surprising that
new democracies have been associated with large political
budget cycles. One study19 ﬁnds that the ﬁscal deﬁcits of
44 African countries where multiparty competitive elections
have been held increased by 1.2 per cent of gross domestic
product (GDP) during election years. Signiﬁcantly, it ﬁnds
no cycles in countries with non-competitive elections.

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

BOX 11.3: High levels of ethnic fragmentation may be good for democracy and redistribution
The effects of ethnic diversity on behaviour are complex. In a 15-country UNRISD study on ethnic inequalities and the public sector,
for example, it was found that a high level of fragmentation – meaning that no group was large enough to dominate the public sphere
– encourages good inter-group cooperation.

Ethnic structures assume various forms. They vary from cases in which one ethnicity is overwhelmingly dominant and coexists with
numerous small groups (as in Botswana and Lithuania), to cases where two or three groups or two or three large and relatively equal
groups predominate in a multi-ethnic setting (as in Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Fiji, Latvia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Switzerland and
Trinidad). A third possibility includes cases in which the ethnic structure is very diverse and may take two forms: cases of high levels
of fragmentation (as in Papua Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania), and cases where fragmentation is interspersed with a few
large and relatively equal groups, which may encourage polarization (as in Ghana, India and Kenya).

The ﬁndings suggest that in cases where one ethnicity is overwhelmingly dominant and co-exists with many small groups, ethnicity is
less likely to be important in determining how the public sector is governed. Electoral competitiveness may open up conﬂicts within
the dominant ethnicity, allowing individuals from minority groups to participate actively in parties led by individuals from dominant
groups. In Botswana, even though most Tswana vote for the ruling party, a sizeable percentage also support opposition parties; and
minorities have not formed separate parties from those led by Tswana. Candidates from the three dominant Tswana subgroups and
the second largest group, the Kalanga, have occupied more than two-thirds of the cumulative parliamentary seats of the main political
parties since 1965. Although the Tswana constitute 70 per cent of the population, they accounted for only 58 per cent of cabinet posts
in 2000, 50 per cent of top civil service posts in 2003, and 61 per cent of parliamentary seats in 2000, suggesting strong representation
of minorities in the public sector. Voting patterns have assumed an urban-rural divide, with the opposition winning most urban votes
and the government winning rural ones. A multi-ethnic elite pact at independence that granted the Tswana language ofﬁcial status
(along with English) was made in exchange for equal distribution of resources among all groups. Only the small pastoral San group
feels strongly excluded.

In highly fragmented settings with relatively small ethnic groups, as in the United Republic of Tanzania, ethnic-based behaviour
in the public domain is also likely to be less virulent, since it is difﬁcult for a single group to be hegemonic under free, fair and
competitive conditions. Since political parties may have to appeal to a cross-section of groups to be electorally viable, they are bound
to be multi-ethnic. No single ethnic group dominates the United Republic of Tanzania’s public sector in terms of their share of posts.
The largest ethnic group (which makes up 13 per cent of the population) and the second largest group (4 per cent of the population)
were not represented at all at the top layer of the civil service in 2006. This is not surprising, since it is rare for an ethnic group to have
more than one member at the top cadre of the civil service and cabinet. In the 1990 cabinet, for instance, the largest group had only
7 per cent of posts, the second largest had none, and the third largest (4 per cent of the population) had 4 per cent. A similar distribution
was found in the 1995 and 2000 cabinets, except that the second largest group increased its share from 0 to 4 per cent. The third
largest group was not included in the 1995 cabinet, but got 7 per cent of the total in 2000.

The more difﬁcult cases are countries with bipolar and tripolar ethnic structures or cases where ethnic fragmentation is interspersed
with a few large and relatively equal groups that may form selective ethnic coalitions. Countries with these types of ethnic structures
that are relatively stable and cohesive have introduced institutions and policies that are sensitive to ethnicity in order to inﬂuence the
way in which the public sector is governed.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 11 – DEMOCRACY AND THE POLITICS OF POVERTY REDUCTION

4. When Democracies
Deliver Outcomes That Are
Beneﬁcial to the Poor
Some democracies have been able to overcome these constraints and deliver outcomes that are beneﬁcial to the
poor. This section discusses ﬁve broad types of cases involving interest group and social movement activism. It makes
four arguments:
• Democracies deliver outcomes that are beneﬁcial
to the poor when groups with strong ties to the
poor demonstrate the capacity for organization and
mobilization, transcend or reconcile horizontal
divisions, and create structural links with actors
involved in policy making. This leads, at times,
to social pacts.
• Some success can be achieved without formal
group ties to state actors, but these require high
levels of contestation and continuous mobilization
to sustain gains. Contestation may block unpopular
policies or may lead to the adoption of some
popular demands in public policy. However,
institutionalization can be a problem without
continuous mobilization.
• Electoral competitiveness in which there is a high
probability that governments may lose ofﬁce can act as
an incentive for redistribution and progressive reforms.
However, electoral competitiveness without effective
group organization and contestation may produce weak
redistributive outcomes.
• The poor suffer when interest groups and social
movements are weak and when the electoral system is
not sufﬁciently competitive.

In high-income democracies, organized
interest groups spurred redistribution
In high-income democracies, contestation by organized
interest groups produced institutional regimes that allowed
groups to bargain with state authorities and inﬂuence the
direction of public policies. In these countries, democracy

and welfare development were driven by similar processes in
which trade unions, acting through social democratic and
clerical parties, played a substantial role. Socialist/labour
voting in the early period of democratization correlated
highly with welfare programme consolidation (meaning
that countries adopted at least three of the four main social
insurance programmes relating to work accidents, health,
pension and unemployment).23 However, labour needed
allies, since it was unable to effect democratic change and
welfare development on its own. Though workers were in
the majority in all countries, working-class parties could
not obtain electoral majorities. Socialist parties’ share of
the vote averaged 30 per cent.24
In the Nordic countries, workers collaborated with segments of the middle class and small farmers, who defended
their interests through agrarian parties. The preferences of
agrarian parties for ﬂat-rate, universal, tax-ﬁnanced beneﬁts came to deﬁne the welfare policies of social democratic regimes. Despite the importance of small farmers
in democratization and social policy development, early
agrarian democracies or those with no strong labour participation (such as Canada, France, New Zealand, Norway,
Switzerland and northern and western parts of the United
States) were laggards in welfare development. In Belgium
and the Netherlands, unions and working-class organizations worked through clerical parties whose ideology was
critical of free-market capitalism. However, while social
democratic parties provided platforms for women’s groups
to mobilize for the incorporation of gender issues in welfare
policies,25 clerical parties were not so accommodating to
gender interests. In the Netherlands, for instance, women
perform poorly on labour force participation, unpaid care
work and the provision of childcare facilities.26
The bargaining regime of countries with superior social
outcomes took the form of social pacts. The key features of
such pacts included the recognition granted to representatives of labour and employers in negotiations over wages,
employment, working conditions and welfare; the ability
of group representatives to ensure members’ compliance
when decisions were reached; and the mutual recognition
of each actor’s importance in achieving goals, including the

295

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

relative capacity of parties to obstruct outcomes that were
not based on consensus. Social pacts were not conﬁned to
the industrial sector. Agrarian pacts were also constructed

in many countries. These improved farm incomes and
narrowed rural-urban inequalities in many countries where
farmers’ votes were important (see box 11.4).

BOX 11.4: Social pacts between farmers and the state improve well-being
Historically in industrialized democracies, close links among farmers, politicians and bureaucrats were a key feature in the evolution
of agricultural policies that insulated farmers from the vagaries of market forces. These policies took the form of direct cash transfers,
minimum support prices and various other subsidies. They also included policies that increased opportunities for non-agricultural
employment and environmental policies that provided transfers in connection with conservation or environmental protection measures.
The agricultural welfare state depended on corporatist, or quasi-corporatist, arrangements between producers associations and
agricultural bureaucracies. Often this took the form of a single peak association that enjoyed a representational monopoly in the
policy process, although not necessarily so. In the United States, for example, commodity-based organizations carry greater inﬂuence
in policy discussions than broader farmers organizations. In many European countries, multiple producers associations organized
along regional, religious or economic lines represent farmers in policy discussions. In political terms, farmers eventually became
important electoral constituencies. Sometimes, these political ties linked farm organizations to parties of the Centre Right, as in
Japan and France. Other times, farmers organizations became core constituencies of the Centre-Left, as in many Nordic countries.
Although the speciﬁc policies, organizations and political components varied, the agricultural welfare state provided farmers with a
steady stream of beneﬁts, access to policy and attention from politicians. Today, in fact, these close relations between farmers and the
state are a major obstacle to reaching political agreement on the reduction of agricultural subsidies in wealthy countries.
In the developing world, relations between farmers and the state look very different. Not many examples can be found of political
incorporation of producers or stable arrangements of policy coordination built around agricultural associations. However, exceptions do
exist, which suggest the conditions under which agrarian social pacts might emerge. In parts of India, for example, policies designed to
increase dairy farming helped to promote producers cooperatives. The programme has been a success, contributing to a pronounced
increase in per capita milk production over the past decades. But there are also indications that cooperative members, many of them
women, have become politically inﬂuential as a source of votes in local, state and national elections. In Eastern Europe, agrarian political
parties have been inﬂuential players in the post-communist transition in several countries. In Poland, where 20 per cent of the labour force
is employed in farming, agrarian parties have competed successfully for the rural vote, frequently earning a place as a junior coalition
partner in the government. Finally, in Senegal, peasant organizations, producers cooperatives and other farmers associations came
together in the early 1990s to create the Conseil national de concertation et de coopération rurale (CNCR). With a membership that reached
more than 3 million farmers by 1995, the CNCR plays a central role in the elaboration of government policies towards agriculture.
How do such relationships take shape? Historical legacies matter a great deal, especially with regard to the character of agricultural
policies, the development of rural organizations, and the structure of macro-political institutions. In addition, however, relationships
forged in industrialized countries, as well as those cited in India, Poland and Senegal each occurred in a context of democratic politics.
Although generalizations are difﬁcult, it can be argued that competitive elections are conducive to the emergence of agrarian social
pacts. This is because the capacity for agricultural associations to shape sectoral policies depends on the political value of farmers
as an inﬂuential source of votes. However, an important caveat must be noted as well: farmers do not always or necessarily vote as
farmers. Where regional, ethnic or religious cleavages are the basis of political identities, it will be more difﬁcult for producers to
become inﬂuential in politics and, accordingly, inﬂuence policy.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 11 – DEMOCRACY AND THE POLITICS OF POVERTY REDUCTION

High levels of unionization and coverage rates in social
democratic regimes encouraged unions to support policies that reconciled wage and welfare demands with
the goals of proﬁtability and growth. Unions supported
policies of wage compression and equal pay for equal
work across sectors, which spurred employers to raise
labour productivity and avoid the option of cheap
labour and segmentation.27 Unions were also able to
restrain the short-term interests of their members
because of their encompassing position in the economy: deals that arose from bargaining had wide worker
coverage, and bargaining took place at the national,
not industry, level. An important social policy innovation that took place in Sweden in the 1960s and 1970s
was bringing women’s particular interests (publicly
supported childcare, employment) into the policy agenda.
This may have been facilitated by union preferences
for women’s labour versus immigrant labour to solve the
labour shortage problem. But it also involved considerable
bargaining and brokering by feminists with men in the
Social Democratic Party, who were lukewarm towards feminism, and with men in the blue-collar trade unions who
were even less sympathetic to many of their demands.28
Although sector-level bargaining may encourage union
federations to be concerned primarily with the narrow
interests of their own members, some countries with such
labour market institutions, such as Germany, have been
able to coordinate deals across sectors to produce relatively
stable economic outcomes.29 The deﬂationary policies of
independent central banks in periods of wage-push inﬂation may force unions to moderate their claims. However,
these countries score less on welfare outcomes than those
with peak-level bargaining institutions and central banks
that are relatively accommodating.
As chapter 5 shows, although social transfers have
reduced poverty in all high-income democracies, countries
classiﬁed as social democratic have been more effective
in reducing poverty, followed by countries classiﬁed as
Christian democratic. Those characterized as liberal
regimes, which have weak labour movements and pluralistic institutions of interest representation in policy making,
are the least effective.

In welfare democracies in the South, subaltern
groups were the main catalysts for change
In a few established democracies in developing countries,
subaltern interest groups are fairly well organized and are
part of broad social movements that have inﬂuenced the
policies of political parties.30 The most well-known cases
are Costa Rica, the Indian states of Kerala and West
Bengal, and Mauritius. Because these were largely agrarian societies when democratic politics were introduced,
peasant movements and organizations were much more
active in the construction of the alliances that produced
welfare-enhancing policies. In Costa Rica and Mauritius,
smallholders displayed remarkable organizational abilities
because of the absence of powerful land-owning elites. In
Kerala and West Bengal, revolutionary parties implemented
land reforms during the early stages of democratization.
In Costa Rica, although the dominant coffee elite owned
a few large farms, the bulk of its income was derived from
processing and external trade, and not from the exploitation
of farm labour. There were many unions representing landless peasants and defending land invasions between 1970 and
1990.31 In Mauritius, although agriculture was dominated by
merchant capital and an agrarian bourgeoisie, there was also
a large class of small landholders and rural farm workers. In
Kerala, highly unequal agrarian land ownership, discriminatory caste structures, and growth of a rural proletariat that
followed land commercialization in the south spawned a
range of peasant movements for land reform, wage increases
and social reforms, which enhanced the role of smallholders
and the rural proletariat in the political economy.32
In these societies, subaltern groups were sufﬁciently organized to inﬂuence the orientation of politicians without
reliance on intermediaries. In Costa Rica, farmers formed
the National Association of Coffee Producers to defend
smallholders’ interests on prices, taxes, credit and welfare.
In Mauritius, the peasantry collaborated with the growing
agricultural labour force, which had formed the Mauritius Agricultural Labourers’ Association, and urban trade
unions, such as the Engineering and Technical Workers’
Union, which waged active campaigns for labour rights,

297

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

wage increases and improved working conditions. These
organizations played a role in the formation of the ﬁrst
nationalist party, the Mauritius Labour Party, which spearheaded social reforms. Signiﬁcantly, these interest-based
organizations and parties bridged the Indian-Creole ethnic divide that threatened to undermine social peace.33 In
Kerala, because of the twin problems of land alienation and
social discrimination, the main social movements were the
anti-caste reformist movements in the south, and the land
reform movements in the more feudalistic north. All three
cases involved a dense network of civil society organizations. In Kerala, unionization often extended to informal
sector workers. Social pacts involving the participation of
government, labour and business were institutionalized in
Kerala and Mauritius. This helped to reduce strikes and
improve wages and working conditions.

In these societies, subaltern
groups were sufﬁciently
organized to inﬂuence the orientation
of politicians without reliance
on intermediaries

The main political parties embraced a discourse of social
rights and equity. In Kerala and West Bengal, the main
parties of reform were communist parties, which embraced
a parliamentary route to transformation and established
strong ties with the peasantry and, especially in Kerala,
a small working class. In Costa Rica, although the main
parties were not strongly linked to social movements, the
elite adopted a social democratic orientation. A reformist
communist party (later banned), with ties to a small labour
force, helped shape the discourse on social rights when the
welfare state was established in the 1940s. In Mauritius, all
the major parties deﬁne themselves as social democratic
and consistently regard social rights as acquired rights by
citizens.34 The deepening of democracy and extension of
social rights eroded clientelistic relationships.35

298

In Costa Rica, Kerala and Mauritius, parties routinely alternate in government. No single party accounts for all the
votes of subaltern groups. In Kerala, despite its transformative agenda, the Communist Party has never ruled for two
consecutive terms, and competes with the Congress Party
for the votes of the peasantry and rural workers. This has
forced the Communist Party to retain much of its social
movement character – constantly organizing its base, building alliances with new groups, and making demands that
address the interests of its base.36 Electoral competition
and active citizenship have also forced the Congress Party
to imitate the strategies of the Communists by responding
to the needs of the electorate. The failure to build permanent winning coalitions suggests that competitive elections
play a more substantial role in forcing leaders to pursue
redistributive policies than in the social democracies of
advanced industrialized societies where social democrats
governed for long periods through the electoral alliance
of workers, small farmers and the middle class. Some scholars have argued that power alternation in Kerala explains
its superior social outcomes when compared to West Bengal, where Communists have been in power for more than
20 years.37
Interest-group politics have tended to be inclusive, rather
than sectarian, because groups forged rural-urban alliances
that incorporated wide segments of the population. This
has been favourable to both growth and redistribution.
Although the growth rates of these welfare democracies
did not reach the levels of the East Asian developmental states, they were respectable for much of the period of
the 1960s–1990s (with growth in Mauritius reaching
6 per cent; in Costa Rica, it averaged 5.3 per cent in
1963–2000, and 7.6 per cent in 1963–1973). This ensured
some economic transformation and funding of extensive
social programmes, although Kerala relies substantially on
overseas remittance income. Rural-urban alliances also
facilitated extension of welfare rights to all citizens. Welfare protection in Costa Rica initially covered non-skilled
and semi-skilled workers, and later those who were not
considered poor. Social insurance coverage in that country was eventually extended to informal sector workers and
farmers (see chapter 5).38

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 11 – DEMOCRACY AND THE POLITICS OF POVERTY REDUCTION

Remarkable strides in social development have been made
in all four cases. Costa Rica spends 16 per cent of its GDP
on the social sector. And, unlike dualist regimes with highly
regressive welfare policies, social expenditure is shared
almost equally among education (31 per cent), health care
(31 per cent) and pensions (28 per cent). Social policy
is oriented towards increased coverage of the population
under a uniﬁed system (see chapters 5 and 6). Similarly, in
Kerala, a large proportion of the population enjoys social
protection and has access to food subsidies; the coverage of
health care and primary education is universal. In Mauritius, there is a universal basic retirement pension, free primary and secondary education, comprehensive free medical
care and subsidized basic foodstuffs. The overall effect is
that poverty rates have been drastically reduced in these
cases, and literacy and life expectancy rates are comparable
to those of industrialized countries.

rates have been drastically reduced,
and literacy and life expectancy
rates are comparable to those of

In dualist countries leaning towards welfare
democracy, social pacts have been key
In the context of current democratization, a few other countries appear to be leaning towards a social democratic path,
especially some of the dualist or highly unequal regimes in
Latin America and in South Africa. Because of their high
levels of industrialization, unions in these economies are
often well organized and have been able to protect members’ welfare beneﬁts, often at the expense of those with
weak or no links to the formal labour market.39 This section
focuses on Brazil, South Africa and Bolivia.

Brazil
During Brazil’s ﬁrst decade of democratic rule from the mid1980s to the early 1990s, the new leaders were not strongly
committed to redistribution. However, under presidents
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,
there was a reversal of trends, representing a move towards
more broad-based and expansive social programmes.40 The
nature of the coalition underpinning the presidency is one
of the key explanatory factors for the change. Cardoso
mounted an effective alliance of Left-wing and social democrats (the Brazilian Social Democratic Party) and the Centre Right (represented by the Liberal Front Party and part
of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party). In turn, Lula
represented the rise to power of the Workers’ Party, with
strong ties to the industrial working class and a commitment
to the cause of redistribution and welfare policies. Civil society organizations that campaigned for the impeachment of
a former president (Fernando Collor de Mello) through the
Movement for Ethics in Politics later turned their attention
to the issue of poverty, which gained prominence in policy
circles as the democratic regime was consolidated.
There appears to be a virtuous cycle linking comprehensive social assistance programmes to electoral competition.
The programmes with the highest redistributive impact –
conditional cash transfers – have generated a politically
efﬁcacious constituency. The comprehensive nature of the
programmes reﬂects the dynamics of electoral politics in
which presidents respond to the demands of the rural poor
that were empowered when the vote was universalized
in the mid-1980s. While there is an overlap between
the beneﬁciaries of one of the most important cash transfer programmes, Bolsa Familia, and the rural pension programme, the clientele of Bolsa Familia in 2008 included
11 million families, affecting probably about 18 million
voters; the clientele for rural pensions included 8 million
beneﬁciary households, representing a constituency of
some 12 million voters.
Before the introduction of cash transfer schemes, credit
for social programmes was mostly claimed by the political elite at the subnational level. Historically, funding for
education, health and, most notably, social assistance was

299

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

determined by patronage games and clientelistic networks,
typically involving local elites. However, the current cash
transfer programmes operate in a fairly transparent manner, with minimum corruption or patronage by powerful
politicians. Under the new dispensation, presidents have
a strong incentive for poverty reduction because they have
become accountable for social policy for the ﬁrst time.
Because the constituency of presidents is the whole country, they tend to develop a strong interest in programmes
that are not focused on narrow groups of the population.41
However, inequalities remain very high, despite recent
progress in reducing them, raising serious questions about
the extent to which the project of welfare democracy can
be advanced.

In South Africa, democratic
processes have driven the expansion
of social assistance, which has become
the main vehicle for addressing the
plight of the poor

South Africa
In South Africa, democratic processes have also driven
the expansion of social assistance, which has become the
main vehicle for addressing the plight of the poor in the
light of a growth strategy that has failed to generate investment and employment.42 In part, this failure was due to the
racially repressive labour regime that created extremely
high income differentials during the apartheid era. The
subsequent struggle for democracy produced an alliance
between the main trade union organization, the Congress
of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), and the African National Congress (ANC), which resulted in a joint
programme for reconstruction and development. The new
ANC government established a multipartite body to reach
consensus on economic and social policy among organized labour, organized employers, community groups and

300

the government. However, consensus on macroeconomic
issues proved elusive as the government’s policy shifted in
a more liberal direction. Meanwhile, the labour movement
pressed relentlessly for improved wages and often backed
up its demands with strikes. Employers failed to invest
proﬁts and expand employment, preferring to transfer
capital overseas.
Despite these tensions, the pact between the labour movement and the government has survived; when combined
with electoral pressures, it has tended to push the government in a social democratic direction on social policy.
Government spending on social assistance programmes has
grown rapidly – from 2 per cent to about 3.5 per cent of
GDP between 1994 and 2006. Expenditure doubled in real
terms between 1994 and 2004. By mid-2006, about 11 million grants were being paid each month. One in four South
Africans receives a pension or grant ﬁnanced out of general
taxation (see chapters 5 and 8). However, the very high
levels of inequality inherited from the apartheid era act as
serious constraints on the development of social democracy.
The record of social movements in pushing through progressive agendas is mixed. For example, social movements such
as Treatment Action Campaign have collaborated with
COSATU to change the government’s policy of neglecting
the AIDS epidemic. However, rural social movements have
been unable to affect public policy on land reform, which
remains wedded to a market-friendly willing buyer–willing
seller framework. Only 3.5 per cent of the area designated as
commercial farmland had been redistributed by 2005.

Bolivia
Bolivia represents a mineral-rich country in which a government with strong ties to social movements has attempted
to change the country’s welfare trajectory in favour of
redistribution. 43 In countries with extractive industries, by
far the most signiﬁcant channels through which they can
ﬁnance programmes for poverty reduction are tax and royalty payments to government. The extent to which these
contributions are made, and how they are used, has become
a particularly conﬂictive axis of activity for social movements, and one that brings such movements and states
closer together. The current governing party (Movimiento

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 11 – DEMOCRACY AND THE POLITICS OF POVERTY REDUCTION

al Socialismo, or MAS), grew out of social movement
processes, especially among coca producers and the more
historic sindicalist highland peasant movements. These
origins inevitably gave the movement/party a heavy antiimperialist ideology. There was a clear resonance between
these movement processes and the two major “resource
wars” in Bolivia over the last decade (over water in 2000,
and over gas between 2003 and 2005), each of which
contested the control of strategic national interests by
international companies. Not surprisingly, within the ﬁrst
year of its election, MAS passed decrees to nationalize
ownership of hydrocarbons and reﬁneries.

Issues of social protection and targeted support to the elderly
and to mothers became an issue for the movement when it
came into power (see chapter 8). However, the need to fund
programmes such as these generated other challenges, both
within submovements of the MAS as well as with opposition
movements. Lowland indigenous groups, which generally
support MAS, perceive expansion of hydrocarbon production
as compromising the security of their livelihoods. The fact
that MAS tried to retain some of the revenues from hydrocarbons usually returned to the departments from which
they were extracted has led to tensions with the opposition
movements. This has renewed dynamism within the older
separatist movements among non-indigenous (and politically conservative) populations in the lowland provinces,
who complain that this policy change is taking assets away
from them. During 2008, movements harnessed this concern
and were able to initiate civil disobedience and direct action

on a massive scale that, for a short while, called into question the viability of the MAS government. Ultimately, the
government survived and emerged strengthened. However,
the more general point can be made that one movement’s
efforts to use the instruments of government to appropriate
resources for poverty reduction can – depending on where
those resources come from – elicit responses from other
movements resisting them. Deeply entrenched inequalities
across a number of economic and social dimensions constrain
efforts to pursue a uniﬁed and progressive social agenda.

Gains are possible, even if interest
groups lack ties to power
Some gains can be achieved even in contexts where contestation has not produced strong ties with ruling parties or
institutionalized regimes of bargaining. Much group activism in the context of top-down democratization is of this
type. Although unions were less effective in shaping the
ideologies of the main parties in the Republic of Korea and
Taiwan Province of China, contestation and electoral competitiveness propelled the interests of subaltern groups onto
the public agenda. Social movement activism in developing
countries often takes the form of direct action by relatively
autonomous groups, with positive outcomes for livelihoods
in some cases. This section focuses on the cases of the
Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China and Peru.

Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China
Democratization in the successful developmental state of
the Republic of Korea and the equally successful Taiwan
Province of China was associated with inclusive welfare
policies. In both cases, democratization occurred in the
context of a major ﬁnancial crisis that required reform
of the labour policy of life-long employment. The rise in
unemployment and part-time work generated calls for the
expansion of welfare beneﬁts. However, despite high levels of industrialization, the policies of political parties did
not reﬂect the classic capital-labour cleavage, and unions
were less effective in inﬂuencing the policies of the main
parties. Korean parties were driven by charismatic leaders
who eschewed links with labour unions, preferring instead
to mobilize votes on the basis of regional calculations and

301

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

selective social concerns. A social pact involving government, labour, employers and party leaders was constructed
at the height of the 1997 Asian ﬁnancial crisis and helped
rebuild business conﬁdence and expand social assistance.44
Despite the establishment of a tripartite commission, commitment by both government and labour to this mode of
interest intermediation has remained weak. Taiwanese parties maintained ties with labour unions; however, these were
pragmatic rather than ideological, since the basic cleavage
was between parties that advocated national independence
and those that preferred reuniﬁcation with the mainland.
The developmental regimes in both the Republic of
Korea and Taiwan Province of China were based on wage
repression, labour acquiescence and ofﬁcially sanctioned,
government-dependent unions, which operated mainly
in large enterprises: the chaebols in the Republic of Korea
and government-owned enterprises in Taiwan Province of
China. This may partly explain why, despite their level of
industrial development and democratization, both places
have very low levels of unionization (13.6 per cent of the
labour force in the Republic of Korea and 10.5 per cent in
Taiwan Province of China). The bulk of the labour force
is employed in medium and small enterprises (87 per cent
in the Republic of Korea and 78 per cent in Taiwan Province of China) and is not unionized.45 However, patterns
of government-labour relations differ. Labour has some ties
with political parties in Taiwan Province of China because
democratization started at the local government level,
where unionized workers’ votes were often decisive. The
two main union federations, the Chinese Federation of
Labour and the Taiwan Confederation of Trade Unions, are
each allied to the two main parties, the Kuomintang Party
and the Democratic Progressive Party respectively. Unions
have taken advantage of the single non-transferable vote
system, in which voters choose candidates in multimember
constituencies, to punish candidates, including those supported by their respective labour federation, if they ignore
labour demands. Unions’ electoral power at the central
level is, however, rather weak.
In the Republic of Korea, difﬁculties in consolidating the
party system (party splits and mergers are common) have

302

resulted in less effective links between parties and unions
and account for the high levels of labour militancy, including formation of a labour party by the Radical Union
Federation. The relative autonomy of unions and social
movements in the country encouraged formation of broad
advocacy coalitions for social policy reform, which focused
on unemployment insurance; public works, training and
basic income schemes that did not require means testing;
family policies; and a universal health service system.46 As
social conditions deteriorated in the face of the 1997 ﬁnancial crisis, welfare reform became a vote-winning issue,
which the opposition party was able to exploit to win ofﬁce
for the ﬁrst time. In Taiwan Province of China, even though
unions and social movements were attached to the main
parties, they played virtually no role in setting the agenda
for social policy reform.47 The national health system, for
instance, was established by the previously authoritarian
government, anxious to shore up its legitimacy and win bitterly contested elections, even though the main advocate
of reform was the opposition party.

In both the Republic of Korea and
Taiwan Province of China, electoral
competition introduced conditions of
uncertainty for the ruling authorities
and opposition parties and forced them
to implement redistributive policies

In both places, electoral competition introduced conditions
of uncertainty for the ruling authorities and opposition parties and forced them to implement redistributive policies.
However, weak union-party links in the Republic of Korea,
or lack of a policy stance that reﬂects subaltern interests in
parties with union links in Taiwan Province of China, act
as a limit on the extent to which these now democratic
developmental regimes can push the redistributive agenda
along more social democratic lines.

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 11 – DEMOCRACY AND THE POLITICS OF POVERTY REDUCTION

Peru
48

The case of Peru represents social movement activism in
a highly unequal and less industrialized society. Movement
activism involves direct action without an institutionalized
regime for bargaining. Interactions between social movements and the state may be characterized more by recurring
cycles of conﬂict, which in some contexts have produced
pro-poor outcomes. Over the last 15 years, Peruvian governments have increasingly tied their development strategy to a rapid expansion of mineral, oil and gas extraction,
affecting over half of the country’s peasant communities
and spawning a movement dedicated to the defence of livelihoods of communities affected by mining. The response
to hydrocarbon extraction has also been led by existing
indigenous peoples’ organizations under the umbrella of the
Association of Indigenous Peoples for the Development of
the Peruvian Jungle.
Despite their weaknesses, these movements have made the
extractive industry and its links to poverty, the environment and indigenous peoples a topic of public debate. Techniques have often been confrontational, and sometimes
violent, and have prompted clamp-downs and repression.
While justiﬁcation of such techniques remains questionable, it is also true that neither government nor companies
paid attention when direct action was not used. Moreover,
the use of direct action has opened political space in which
negotiations over policy, though not institutionalized, have
occurred. Negotiations have allowed for more protection
of the asset bases of local populations, including the introduction of water monitoring programmes around mining
sites, and greater recognition of land rights. They have also
contributed to an increase in revenue transfers to mineaffected areas: in 2004, the government ruled that 50 per
cent of the taxes paid by mining companies to central government would be returned to the regions of extraction.
Negotiations also called into question the adequacy of
existing public institutions for ensuring that growth results
in poverty reduction – an issue that became prominent in
the 2005–2006 presidential election campaigns. In each of
these instances, however, these changes have come about
because other actors (including those from industry) have
also come to support them, partly as a result of protests.

In countries with weak civil societies,
electoral competition can bring leaders
to account
The structure of labour markets in agrarian economies
can act as a constraint on interest-group pressure for welfare development, although, as an earlier section of this
chapter showed, these constraints have been overcome
in some cases through well-organized civil societies and
broad-based parties. In many low-income agrarian societies, NGOs and donors play active roles in poverty reduction. However, their capacity to effect real change has been
limited because of weak links with broader groups in
society. In these types of democracies, electoral competitiveness can be an important instrument for extracting
accountability from leaders. One study49 provides evidence
for the ways in which democracy has affected government
priorities and shifted pro-urban biases in educational provision in Africa. Democratization made governments more
responsive to the needs of the rural poor, who constitute
the majority of voters. However, as section 3 has shown,
the electoral system in most agrarian democracies is not
competitive enough. Governments enjoy huge parliamentary majorities and retain the capacity to immunize
themselves from electoral defeat. The lack of electoral
competitiveness and low density and strength of associations and movements often make it difﬁcult to sustain gains
outside of electoral cycles.

In many low-income agrarian
societies, despite the limited nature
of the wage economy, unions have,
on numerous occasions, been able to
pressure governments and employers
to act on the livelihoods of workers

303

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

In alliance with other groups, they have also managed to
resist policies such as price increases on basic commodities
and services.50 However, unions’ resistance to adjustment
programmes exposed them to attack from reforming governments and their international backers, who argued that
rural poverty was a product of discriminatory trade and pricing policies favoured by an urban coalition that included
the working class. Authoritarian measures were supported
to free markets and release the grip of the so-called urban
coalition on public policy.51 While these measures weakened
union power and undermined workers’ livelihoods, they did
not necessarily improve the incomes and power of farmers.

sector is small and crisis and adjustment have taken a toll
on union membership, governments have ignored union
pressures for redistributive policies.

Despite their dwindling membership
base, unions played an important
role in the process of democratization
because of their strategic location in the
modern economy, although links with
governing parties remain tenuous

Despite these constraints, there is evidence of gains at
the micro and sectoral levels for groups in both urban
and rural areas. The most notable has been the dramatic
growth of producer organizations in rural settings. In
Burkina Faso, the number of villages with at least one
rural producer organization increased from 22 per cent to
91 per cent between 1982 and 2002; local associations
increased in Senegal from 10 per cent to 65 per cent of
villages over the same period.54 There is also evidence of
rapid increases in the number of producers organizations
in parts of Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Kenya and
the United Republic of Tanzania.55 Part of this growth can
be attributed to international donors that helped promote
such organizations in the 1990s. However, the effect of
these organizations on poverty reduction is ambiguous.56
It seems, however, that they have had some impact in
countries where elections have been ﬁercely and fairly
contested, such as Ghana and Senegal.57

Organizations of subaltern groups participated in the wave
of democratization that swept through countries in the
1990s, although their capacity to subsequently inﬂuence
the direction of policy has been limited. The role of unions
in democratization was particularly signiﬁcant because of
their strategic location in the modern economy, despite
their dwindling membership base.52 In some African cases,
such as Zambia and Zimbabwe, unions provided leadership
for a coalition of forces, although the links with governing parties have remained tenuous since elites and external
actors dominate the reform agenda. In other cases, such
as Ghana, unions have avoided formal ties with parties,
preferring to exert pressure as independent actors. Such
autonomy does not always guarantee success, since Ghanaian unions’ hold on public policy remains weak.53 In Senegal, a plurality of trade union federations are afﬁliated to
different parties, although their inﬂuence on party policies
is limited. In many other agrarian settings, such as Uganda
and the United Republic of Tanzania, where the industrial

In the midst of Senegal’s economic crisis in the 1970s, a
number of peasant associations began to develop. Encouraged by a former extension service ofﬁcial who was president of a local NGO, and with support from international
donors, a dozen associations formed a national federation
in 1976. When SAPs ended most government interventions in the countryside, the associations provided agricultural services to their members. Membership expanded
to 24 associations of 2,000 village groups representing
over 400,000 members. Taking advantage of a national
election in 1993, the federation organized a forum that
included government ofﬁcials and donors.58 Seven organizations that had participated in the forum later created the
Conseil national de concertation et de coopération rurale
(National Council for Rural Dialogue and Cooperation),
or CNCR. The Council became “a single, authoritative
interlocutor . . . a full participant in a range of programs
and policy forums”.59 The CNCR’s decision to walk out of
negotiations that had stalled over the Agricultural Structural Investment Programme in the mid-1990s forced the

304

SECTION THREE – CHAPTER 11 – DEMOCRACY AND THE POLITICS OF POVERTY REDUCTION

country’s president, who was worried about the rural vote,
to convene a meeting with 150 CNCR representatives.
The meeting resulted in an agreement to cut agricultural
credit interest rates, remove import taxes on agricultural
inputs, issue a ﬁve-year moratorium on farmers’ debts, and
institute a series of regular meetings between CNCR and
the agriculture ministry.

and transparency in public affairs. Technocratic governance severely limits the development of a culture of dialogue
and compromise by foreclosing debates on a wide range of
issues that are relevant to poverty reduction, such as income
distribution, taxation, employment expansion, and protection or non-protection of certain economic activities. Any
economic programme has its trade-offs among which political choices and decisions must be made. Outcomes of such
debates cannot be ﬁxed a priori in democracies.

5. The Politics of Poverty
Reduction: Implications
for Policy

The introduction of PRSPs in low-income, aid-dependent
countries represented an effort to transfer ownership of
economic policies to national governments and democratize policy making through involvement of civic groups in
designing and implementing anti-poverty strategies. However, participation in PRSP forums has taken the form of
consultation without power to effect real change or to get
policy makers to deliver on agreed goals. The macroeconomic issues that have a bearing on the livelihoods of the
poor are not open to substantive discussion, and citizen
groups often feel that decisions on important policies are
made elsewhere.

Power relations lie at the core of development. They determine which actors are in a position to fashion and deﬁne
policies, inﬂuence development processes, govern the
actions of others and participate effectively in economic,
social and political life. In this sense, power is important
in understanding all social outcomes. Strategies that seek
to bring about changes in poverty and inequality must also
consider ways to shift the balance of power. Active citizenship or group activism is important in generating such shifts
and ensuring that governments respond to social needs.60
The driving forces that push democracies to deliver redistributive outcomes are complex. Although democracy has
been embraced as a core value of development, there is little understanding of the politics and institutions that enable
democracies to promote growth and reduce poverty. The
strong wave of democratization that swept much of the developing world in the 1990s and enjoyed strong donor support
occurred simultaneously with donor embrace of technocratic
styles of policy making. This tended to create what have been
described as choiceless democracies.61 Allowing economic
policy to be formulated by small groups of experts is not
only a reﬂection of the centrality of the economic problem,
but also a deliberate attempt to get politics out of economic
policy. It is informed by the belief that policy is best designed
by insulated technocracies. And it is here that there is an
obvious and serious contradiction between the politics of
insulating technocracies and calls for greater accountability

Strategies that seek to bring about
changes in poverty and inequality
must also consider ways to shift the
balance of power
Improving the bargaining regime for poverty reduction
requires interventions on several fronts.

Abandon technocratic styles of policy making
The technocratic styles of policy making tend to eschew
contestation and favour inﬂation control over the equally
important goals of employment and welfare protection. In
order to pursue strategies that are growth-oriented, employment-centred and redistributive, governments and citizen
groups need a certain degree of autonomy and the policy

305

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

space in which to consider a broad range of approaches.
The global ﬁnancial and economic crisis, which has
exposed the destabilizing tendencies of ﬁnance capital and
de-legitimized neoliberal policies, offers opportunities for
alternative styles of policy making. However, their outcome
will depend on the resources countries are able to mobilize
to pursue alternative policies and the balance of forces that
will inform the content of those policies.

Go beyond NGO–centred PRSP forums
and more actively engage associations
and social movements
It is important to engage more actively with associations
and social movements whose members’ livelihoods are
affected by government strategies and global change. This
may require multiple pacts because of the fragmentation of
interests associated with globalization. As already noted,
social pacts are often needed to effect deep and long-term
changes in the welfare of low-income groups, and have
been formed in both industrial and agrarian settings.

Institutionalize rights to encourage effective
group participation in policy making
As this chapter has shown, many new democracies are still
fragile, civil and political rights are not fully institutionalized, and incumbents often have the capacity to frustrate
the choices of voters by rigging elections. The institutionalization of rights will empower groups to exercise political
choice and hold leaders accountable.

Support organizations that represent the
views of diverse groups that include the
participation of formal and informal workers
The existence of organizations that support the interests of
producers is vital to success. Unorganized farmers, for example, are often forced to compete with one another to sell more
in harvest time, which may lead to a fall in prices. A central

306

organization that represents their interests is able to monitor a large number of individual producers and draw up and
enforce production and marketing agreements. Similarly, in
an environment without unions, competition among individual workers may lead to lower wages and beneﬁts. Peak
organizations and coalitions enable groups to overcome
collective action problems of free-riding or defection, and
strengthen capacities to moderate claims or meet targets.
They also help reconcile redistribution and growth. All parties in such a bargaining regime must have strategic goals and
feel a need for cooperation.

Recognize the fact that not all groups can
be incorporated into bargaining regimes
Accountability and progressive outcomes also require
groups with sufﬁcient clout and independence to engage
the state and raise critical issues without the constraints
of institutionalized pacts. Building expertise and organizational capacities is vital for group action that can promote
progressive change in and out of social pacts. Taking interest associations and movements seriously in policy making
may spur groups to develop institutional capacities and act
responsibly – even in the context of limited resources.

Empower the general population to exercise
inﬂuence on how polices are made
Empowering the general population to inﬂuence policies
can often produce good anti-poverty outcomes. Conversely,
policies that lead to a reduction in poverty and inequality improve social solidarity (a cornerstone of citizenship),
lock in disadvantaged groups to the democratic regime by
undermining violent alternatives, weaken clientelist social
relations, and enhance the capacity of citizens to participate
in public life as autonomous actors. In this way, democracy
and poverty reduction can become mutually reinforcing.

Concluding Remarks
Reducing poverty and inequality is not just about having
the right economic policies; it is also about pursuing appropriate social policies and types of politics that elevate the
interests of the poor in public policy. The analysis in the
various chapters of this report points to the importance
of understanding the ways in which institutions and policies are interconnected in different spheres of the political
economy. It suggests that efforts to tackle poverty through
discrete and standardized policies unrelated to a country’s
production and macroeconomic systems, social policies
and politics, are of limited impact, and may even be counterproductive. Policies and institutions in the economic,
social and political spheres need to be consciously coordinated to achieve maximum impact.

Conﬁguring Institutions
So That They Are Complementary
In most countries, institutions tend to complement rather
than substitute for one another. This means that one institutional arrangement may be able to correct the imperfections of another.1 There are many examples of successful
institutional conﬁgurations that are built on complementarities among diverse institutions. For instance, the report
shows that poor countries that succeeded in combining reasonable levels of growth and structural change, good welfare
measures and democratic politics demonstrate a conﬁguration that involves an active citizenry and the incorporation of rural and urban subaltern groups as independent
actors in the policy process. In this sense, democracy needs
not just free and fair elections, but also organized citizens,
special types of state-citizen relations and pacts to deliver
on distribution.

fair elections, but also organized

relations and social pacts to deliver

Aligning Labour
Markets and Social Policy
Another important complementarity can be found between
the structure of the labour market and social policies. The
cost of social policy and the burden of universal coverage
are reduced when the chosen development strategy delivers high levels of employment. Indeed, the labour market
potentially provides the critical framework for integrating
economic and social policies. For example, the manufacturing-led development path of East Asian countries generated low levels of unemployment. Together with the policy
of life-long employment for many (largely male) workers
in key industries, this strategy helped raise the majority of
the population out of poverty. In these economies, there
was a strong link between formal employment and social
protection, which was provided by private ﬁrms with the
state acting as regulator. Following the East Asian ﬁnancial crisis, the dramatic growth in short-term employment
contracts ruptured these complementary links between
employment and social protection, leading to changes in
social policy towards the inclusion of those not formally
employed. The institutions of democratic politics were
central to the dynamics that produced this policy change.

309

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

In countries with dualistic growth paths (such as Latin
American economies), the failure of industrialization to
deliver high levels of formal employment prevented the
realization of positive complementarities between labour
market participation and social protection as demonstrated
in the East Asian cases. States committed to improving
the welfare of the poor instead expanded social assistance
schemes, such as cash transfers. While these schemes have
helped to reduce poverty and inequality, the sharp divisions
in labour markets and the failure of development strategies to generate formal jobs make it difﬁcult to signiﬁcantly
reduce poverty and inequality. The lack of effective complementarity between labour market participation and social
policy in poverty reduction is particularly marked in lowincome service-based economies and agrarian economies
that are characterized by low productivity. In these types
of economies, an overwhelming proportion of the working
population is employed in the informal sector and therefore
lacks adequate coverage by social protection programmes.

Strategically Coordinated Markets
Deliver Better Social Outcomes
than Liberalized Markets
In the 1980s and 1990s, most developing countries
embraced a development strategy that was oriented towards
liberalized markets, ﬁscal stabilization, privatization and a
limited role for the state in efforts to stimulate growth and
reduce poverty. This neoliberal policy regime shares an
afﬁnity with the policy regime of advanced economies in
which markets are the main drivers for coordinating activities across diverse spheres.2 This regime is internally coherent, and has been effective in stabilizing economies and
taming inﬂation, but is less successful in generating growth
and employment-centred structural change, or reducing
poverty in low-income countries.
The report shows that successful late-industrializing
countries embraced more strategic forms of coordination,
involving the state in multiple activities rather than merely

310

the minimal market-enhancing roles of rule setting, regulation and stabilization. Such countries pursued policies
and established institutions that not only allowed things to
happen but also caused things to happen.3 In general, these
successful countries:
• mobilized resources for investment;
• created incentives that spurred entrepreneurs to adopt
a long-term, integrated view of development;
• corrected market failures in credit markets by
intervening to direct credit to weak but potentially
productive investors;
• developed basic infrastructure as well as a trained,
healthy and productive workforce;
• pursued strategies in industry, agriculture and trade
that led to a healthy balance between these sectors; and
• ensured that development had a positive impact on the
well-being of all sections of the population.

institutions that not only
allowed things to happen
but also caused things to happen

Balancing Social and Economic
Sectors in Resource Allocation
The report shows that signiﬁcant progress can be made
when economic and social sectors are effectively aligned
around issues of growth, structural change, employment
and welfare, and are underpinned by appropriate institutions in the political sphere. This suggests that strategies
for allocating resources should aim to achieve the right balance between economic and social sectors for maximum
effects. If governments allocate resources predominantly
to the productive sectors, the productivity gains associated
with investments in social policies, especially education

CONCLUDING REMARKS

and health, will be missed, while individuals who are
disadvantaged or excluded from labour markets may be
adversely affected. Similarly, a disproportionate allocation
of resources to the social sector may harm the development
of productive capacity and over time make it difﬁcult to
ﬁnance social activities.
Donor policies equally need to emphasize these critical complementarities between the economic and social
sectors in tackling poverty, particularly in the least
developed countries. Spending on infrastructure and the
productive sectors (including industry, agriculture, forestry and ﬁshing) has declined since the late 1980s, in part
reﬂecting the neoliberal consensus that such investments
were market distorting. More recently spending on social
sectors and governance has risen,4 a trend that has continued as the focus of development assistance has shifted to
poverty reduction.
The transition away from spending aid on infrastructure
and other productive activities is a more recent phenomenon. Aid for infrastructure remained roughly constant
(between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of total aid) during the 1980s and early to mid-1990s. However, since the
late 1990s, the proportion of aid invested in infrastructure
has roughly halved. This shift appears to be directly related
to a change in emphasis from economic growth to poverty
reduction, as donors seek results in meeting the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets.5 There are signs,
however, that the declining trend in aid for infrastructure
and other productive sectors may be starting to change as
donors heed the recommendations of the inﬂuential UN
Millennium Project, which, in 2005, drew attention to the
massive public investment that is required in the infrastructure of developing countries.
Clearly, in very poor countries with limited resources the
need for investment across a range of sectors is severe.
Weighing up the competing demands of social services,
governance and the productive sectors to ensure that potential synergies created by spending in a variety of areas are
exploited is a complex undertaking. The level of resources
needed for both social and economic sectors needs to be

substantially raised to transform low-income economies and
make signiﬁcant inroads into reducing poverty. The beneﬁts
of improved social policy, such as producing a healthy and
educated workforce, can be effectively exploited when levels of provisioning are high and corresponding investment
is made in productive sectors to generate jobs. Conversely,
as the report has shown, employment generation is a vital
means of linking poor people into economic development
processes and is essential for large-scale poverty reduction.

Creating Synergistic
Relationships
This discussion on synergies and complementarities suggests that development strategies and reforms need to be
sensitive to the ways in which institutions and policies are
connected if they are to produce the desired outcomes.
Institutional interconnectedness requires multiple instruments in order to be effective. For example, the much discredited marketing board systems performed multiple tasks
in African development, but the reforms that dismantled
them had only one focus and one instrument: price liberalization. Governments used the boards to appropriate peasant surpluses and pursue three public policy goals: provide
much-needed foreign exchange for industrialization and
economic development; cushion the incomes of farmers
against world market ﬂuctuations; and provide extension
and social services to farmers and the wider public. The
failure to comprehend the interconnectedness of the marketing board institutions with wider institutions and goals
has been catastrophic in many countries.
Important complementarities also exist among different
social services that may require coordinated and multiple
instruments to maximize their effects. Universal access to
health care, for example, enhances investment in education by ensuring that school enrolment and outcomes are
not constrained by illness. Similarly, universal access to
education enhances investment in health by increasing
the use of information on health practices. Early childhood

311

COMBATING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY

care programmes can improve child health and education
outcomes. Social service provision reduces the need for
social protection or assistance if episodes of illness, and thus
of unemployment and income, are reduced. Social protection mechanisms such as income transfers may in turn relax
ﬁnancial constraints that impede access to social services.
And investments in basic infrastructure such as water, sanitation and transport can improve health outcomes, reduce
time spent collecting water and travelling, and facilitate
access to other services.

Politics Matters in Creating
and Exploiting Synergies
The exploitation of synergies among different sectors
and subsectors is important in overcoming poverty and
inequality. However, such synergistic relationships are
not automatic. They require conscious design of both
economic and social policies, backed by sufﬁciently powerful coalitions to implement them. Institutional complementarities require, but should not be reduced to, policy
coherence, which can degenerate into a technocratic exercise. Competing values on rights, differences in the roles
played by markets and non-market institutions in coordinating activities, and differences in power structures
that have evolved historically all determine variations in
regimes or institutional complementarities.

Poverty reduction is a central feature of the international development agenda and contemporary poverty reduction strategies
increasingly focus on “targeting the poor”, yet poverty and inequality remain intractable foes.
Combating Poverty and Inequality argues that this is because many current approaches to reducing poverty and inequality fail
to consider key institutional, policy and political dimensions that may be both causes of poverty and inequality, and obstacles to
their reduction. Moreover, when a substantial proportion of a country’s population is poor, it makes little sense to detach poverty
from the dynamics of development. For countries that have been successful in increasing the well-being of the majority of their
populations over relatively short periods of time, the report shows, progress has occurred principally through state-directed
strategies that combine economic development objectives with active social policies and forms of politics that elevate the interests
of the poor in public policy.
The report is structured around three main issues, which, it argues, are the critical elements of a sustainable and inclusive
development strategy:
• patterns of growth and structural change (whether in the agricultural, industrial or service sectors) that generate and sustain
jobs that are adequately remunerated and accessible to all, regardless of income or class status, gender, ethnicity or location;
• comprehensive social policies that are grounded in universal rights and that are supportive of structural change, social cohesion
and democratic politics; and
• protection of civic rights, activism and political arrangements that ensure states are responsive to the needs of citizens and
the poor have inﬂuence in how policies are made.
The report seeks to explain why people are poor and why inequalities exist, as well as what can be done to rectify these injustices.
It explores the causes, dynamics and persistence of poverty; examines what works and what has gone wrong in international policy
thinking and practice; and lays out a range of policies and institutional measures that countries can adopt to alleviate poverty.
