We live in a world where 385 million children are struggling on less than
$1.90 a day and there are significant child poverty rates even in the world’s
richest countries. This leaves children and families facing financial barriers
which can make accessing quality services impossible. Social vulnerability
– resulting from the interaction of social dynamics and individual and
family characteristics such as disability, gender, ethnicity or religion –
compounds the impacts of a lack of income.
Consequently, hundreds of millions of children are living in
multidimensional poverty and will struggle to reach their full potential.
This is devastating for the children themselves, and has knock-on effects
for the societies and economies to which they belong. Further, growing
and interconnected global trends, ranging from climate change to forced
migration, threaten to increase child poverty and vulnerability, making the
challenges even greater.
This framework outlines the crucial role child-sensitive social protection
has to play in responding to these current and emerging challenges. It
provides a conceptual framework and shared definition, evidence on the
impacts of social protection, and what a child-sensitive social protection
system should include. Hopefully, this will provide clarity to understanding
child-sensitive social protection and highlight the change it seeks to bring
in children’s daily lives. Put simply, social protection should ensure that
every child:
•
•
•

lives in a household with sufficient financial resources to develop and
fulfil their potential.
has access to quality basic services and the knowledge needed for
development, regardless of income or personal characteristics.
has direct contact with a social or outreach worker when needed, who
can help understand the challenges children and their families may
face and support the responses needed.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Providing this change for children requires a foundation of quality social
services including comprehensive and integrated social protection
systems. The countries that are expanding coverage are demonstrating
what is possible, and the inclusion of social protection in the SDGs
and the international partnership for Universal Social Protection 2030
underlines growing international commitment. However, despite these
positive changes and the proven impacts of social protection, globally 2
out 3 children are not covered by social protection at all.
This programme framework and the guidance that accompanies it outline
UNICEF’s commitment and contribution to social protection for children,
including our key action areas and the activities we undertake. It also
hopes to contribute to a global understanding of child-sensitive social
protection and encourage national and international partners to work
together to strengthen these systems. Social protection is the right of
every child, it is the foundation of a country’s social contract, and requires
national and international collaboration and commitment to provide every
child with coverage and give every child an equal chance.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Since UNICEF produced its first Social Protection
Strategic Framework in 2012, social protection
has expanded rapidly in low- and middle-income
countries, and UNICEF’s work has grown as well,
covering far more countries and areas of support.
A growing number of development partners,
international financial institutions (IFIs) and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have also
increased their work in the area. With robust
evidence clearly establishing the positive impact of
social protection on people’s lives and its inclusion
in Sustainable Development Goal 1 on eradicating
poverty, this momentum is likely to continue.
Against this backdrop, new threats for children
are emerging which social protection can help
to mitigate: climate breakdown; urbanization;
demographic change; and humanitarian crises that
create ongoing risks for children through protracted
conflict and displacement within and across borders.
This updated framework takes these changes
into account, refining UNICEF’s approach to social
protection to reflect this changing landscape, along
with emerging good practice and innovation in the
field. The framework is intended to outline our social
protection priorities, and to foster ever stronger
relationships with governments and international
and national partners. It outlines how UNICEF sees
social protection, why it’s so vital for children, and
provides clarity on the elements of a child-sensitive

social protection system. Finally, it outlines UNICEF’s
10 key action areas on social protection, through
which we are committed to working with partners to
realize social protection for every child.

Why social protection matters:
addressing economic and social
vulnerability to give every child an
equal chance
The conceptual foundations of UNICEF’s approach to
social protection remain unwavering: a rights-based
approach towards universal social protection as set
out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). In
line with our work supporting progressive realization
of universal coverage, we prioritize the poorest
and most vulnerable children and families, with
the objective of breaking the cycle of disadvantage
across generations and ultimately transforming the
lives of children and families (see Box 1).
At the heart of child-sensitive social protection is the
protection of children and families against economic
vulnerability. Living in or being vulnerable to poverty
fundamentally undermines children’s futures, often
with lifelong consequences, directly impacting their
opportunity to access quality social services and,
every bit as perniciously, undermining their dignity
and confidence.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Alongside economic vulnerability, social vulnerability
also has profound impacts on children’s life chances.
Social vulnerability can stem from personal
characteristics such as age, disability or chronic
illness, as well as from social discrimination and
exclusion due to identities such as gender, race,
religion, disability, political affiliation or geographic
location. Evidence consistently shows that socially
vulnerable children and families are more likely to be
in poverty and excluded from social services and,
ultimately, opportunity.
Social protection is a sector dedicated to addressing
these economic and social vulnerabilities. It cannot
stand alone and must be part of an integrated
approach of social services for children. But without
it, the needs of children and families living in poverty
and exclusion now, or vulnerable to it as life’s risks
unfold, will not be addressed.
This framing of child-sensitive social protection
is in line with the inter-agency definition of social
protection that UNICEF helped to develop and
supports:1
`a set of policies and programmes aimed at
preventing or protecting all people against
poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion
throughout their life-course, with a particular
emphasis towards vulnerable groups’

Box 1: Four key principles that guide
UNICEF’s approach to social protection
The best interests of the child – UNICEF supports a
rights-based approach to social protection rooted in the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, and all our work
in social protection is informed by this core principle.
Progressive realization of universal coverage –
UNICEF supports the progressive realization of universal
coverage, which involves helping countries to identify
and expand programmes while recognizing the different
capacities, contexts and challenges that countries face.
National systems and leadership – UNICEF
supports nationally-owned and led systems, and only
in exceptional cases, including in some humanitarian
contexts, would UNICEF consider supporting
implementation of temporary social protection
programmes outside of government collaboration.
Inclusive social protection - UNICEF is committed
to inclusive social protection that is responsive to
the needs of all children and sensitive to particular
characteristics and identities which can increase the risk
of exclusion, including gender, disability status, ethnicity,
HIV status, and geographic location.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

The state of child poverty and vulnerability

both at an individual and societal level. Looking
slightly above this extreme poverty line underlines
the scale of the challenge: about 45 per cent of
children – over 1 billion children – are living in
households subsisting on less than US$3.10 a day
compared to 27 per cent of adults,4 and in some
middle-income countries people living on US$6 a
day face a 40 per cent probability of living in poverty
in subsequent years.5

The implications of child poverty and vulnerability
are felt most immediately by children themselves,
but they have profound implications for nations as
a whole as children become the next generation
of adults that build societies and drive economies.
According to the World Bank, for example,
improving health and education to significantly
improve ‘human capital’ would bring an additional
1.4 per cent annual growth rate for 50 years’.2

Social vulnerabilities impact on children’s life
chances. Evidence consistently shows that children
in disadvantaged groups have higher rates of
poverty and lower access to basic services, such
as healthcare and education. For example, children
with disabilities face extremely high poverty rates
and challenges accessing services, while analysing
poverty with a gender lens shows that women and
girls are often disproportionately affected.

While there has been progress in reducing poverty
in recent decades, 385 million children, or 1 in 5,
are still struggling to survive on less than PPP$1.90
(see Figure1). Put another way: children are more
than twice as likely to be living in extreme income
poverty as adults. For children, poverty is about
much more than income, and 665 million children
are estimated to be living in multidimensionally-poor
households, again with poverty rates consistently
higher than adults. These measures of poverty can
obscure that child poverty is a truly global problem
and so must be the social protection response: 27
OECD countries have child poverty rates above 10
per cent, with only two countries maintaining child
poverty rates below 5 per cent.3

The framework also identifies four key ‘macro’
trends that are having, and will continue to have,
profound impacts on children and families and
to which social protection must be designed to
respond:
•

Poverty measures, while important for social
protection policy design, are often static and can
be blind to the range of vulnerabilities children face

Climate breakdown: Climate breakdown
is changing the world for children in
unprecedented ways, resulting in both
immediate effects and long-term implications for

which future generations will pay the heaviest
price. Poorer households often also have less
resources and capacity to cope with climateinduced shocks.
Demographic shifts: The world population is
increasing and is projected to reach 8.5 billion in
2050. Globally the number of adults and older
people will increase more than the number of
children, but there are stark regional differences,
with Africa seeing by far the largest increase in
the number of children by 2050.
Urbanization: The urban population is expected
to rise by an additional 1 billion people to 5
billion by 2030, when cities will contain 60 per
cent of the world’s population.6 While Asia is
continuing to urbanize rapidly, Africa isn’t far
behind.
Conflict and forced displacement: It is
estimated that by 2030 nearly half of those
living in extreme poverty will live in fragile and
conflict-affected states with devastating impacts
on children. Conflict is also a major driver
forcing families to move, and there are now
more children forcibly displaced by conflict and
violence – an estimated 30 million – than at any
other time since the Second World War.7

The role of social protection
Social protection is designed to address economic
and social vulnerability and provide support to
all that need it across the life course. It has long
been established in higher-income countries as a
foundation of social policy, and now a growing body
of evidence shows the significant impacts social
protection is having in addressing the multiple
dimensions of child poverty and vulnerability in
lower-income countries. Accordingly, while social
protection has been explicitly recognized not only
as a standalone target in SDG 1, it also acts as an
accelerator in achieving results across sectors and
SDGs (see Table 1) and provides a foundation to
ensure no one is left behind.
While the evidence on social protection shows clear
and positive sectoral outcomes, it also highlights
that social protection programming alone cannot
address the holistic needs of children and families,
nor does it address information and knowledge
gaps or the availability of quality services. This
underlines that while social protection is a vital part
of integrated programming for children, alone it is
far from sufficient to fulfil child rights.

Table 1 – Impact of social protection on key sectoral outcomes
Poverty and
productivity
(SDG 1 and 8)

Social protection can address child monetary poverty directly, and where not sufficient to move children and
families above the poverty line it can increase household expenditure. Social protection also increases household
productivity and has positive multiplier effects on local economies. Aspects of social transfer design are crucial,
including programme coverage, transfer size and frequency.

Nutrition
(SDG 2)

Social protection programmes, including cash transfers, show significant impacts on food security, but alone do not
always impact nutritional outcomes for children. In countries with high rates of undernutrition, integrated social
protection interventions (‘cash plus’ programmes) are beginning to demonstrate impacts.

Health
(SDG 3)

Social protection has a significant impact both on the usage of health services and in mitigating the financial impacts of
a health crisis in a household. The evidence generally shows that transfers do not need to be conditional to benefit child
health.

Education
(SDG 4)

Social and economic barriers are a significant impediment to children's education. Social protection, including cash
transfers, has a significant impact on enrolment and attendance, including strong results for girls. Evidence on impacts
on educational outcomes is more limited.

Gender equality
(SDG 5)

Social protection has significant potential to contribute to tackling gender inequality. For example, it can help to reduce
physical abuse and increase women's decision-making power. However, social protection is not automatically
supportive of gender equality and can even reinforce harmful gender norms and practices if not designed and
implemented in a gender-sensitive way.

Water, sanitation
and hygiene
(WASH)
(SDG 6)

WASH has generally received limited focus in social protection programmes and impact evaluations, and relatively little
is known about how addressing economic and social vulnerabilities would affect key WASH indicators. Including
relevant indicators in cash transfer evaluations could clarify the role of changing family income and WASH outcomes.

Child Protection
(SDG 16)

The work of social protection to strengthen families economically and socially may have direct impacts on child
protection results. The role of social service workers and family outreach is a crucial connection between social
protection and child protection.

HIV/AIDS
(Cross-cutting)

HIV-sensitive social protection measures, particularly cash transfer progammes, have a positive impact on mitigating
the risky behaviours associated with HIV, and in supporting the treatment and income of households with HIV-positive
members. ‘Cash plus’ approaches (a combination of cash and linkages to existing services services) may be more
effective to address HIV outcomes than cash alone.

Gaps in social protection coverage for
children and families

in systems development, but in only a very small
minority were they assessed as ‘highly considered’.

Despite the proven impacts of social protection
programmes, coverage of children and families
remains extremely low. Globally, 2 out of 3 children
currently have no access to child or family benefits,
and coverage is lowest where child poverty is
highest. Looking at social protection more broadly,
mapping suggests that 108 countries (out of 136
countries surveyed) either had an active social
protection policy or strategy document in place or
were in the process of planning such a document.
Despite this, determining the child-sensitivity
of these structures is extremely challenging. A
qualitative assessment of UNICEF colleagues
suggests children have received some consideration

Figure 2

Insufficient financing is a major barrier to
comprehensive child-sensitive social protection
systems. On average, countries spend only 1.1
per cent of GDP on social protection for children,
although the amounts vary greatly across countries
and regions: while Europe and Central Asia, as well
as Oceania, spend more than 2 per cent of GDP
on child benefits, regional estimates for Africa, the
Arab States and Southern and South-East Asia show
expenditure levels of less than 0.7 per cent of GDP.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

The key elements of integrated
social protection systems:
protection across the life course
Social protection must provide support across the
life course; an effective and comprehensive system
will thus include different types programmes to
address the varied needs of different population
groups (see Figure 2). From the perspective of
child-sensitive social protection, such a life-course
approach is essential for children to be reached
directly and to recognize their connections with
adults at different stages of their lives (see also
Box 2).

Building a comprehensive approach to social
protection across the life course requires integrated
systems. Social protection systems can be
broken down into three constituent levels: policy,
programme and administrative.8 UNICEF follows
this approach, but adds one additional component
that our experience suggests is essential: to be
effective, child-sensitive social protection systems
must be built on a foundation of evidence which
highlights the situation of children, the impact
of current social protection programming, and
identifies remaining gaps (see Figure 3):

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

•

As outlined Figure 3, the four components of a childsensitive social protection system include:
1.

2.

3.

A foundation of evidence. A robust evidence
base is a necessary foundation for all elements
of a social protection system, including having
a clear understanding of child poverty and
vulnerability as well as of the effectiveness
of existing social protection programmes
and remaining gaps in programme areas and
coverage.

•

Policy, coordination and financing of social
protection systems. The policy level is the
highest level of engagement, where a common
vision is established, and the objectives and
functions of the social protection system are
defined in the context of national goals and
parameters.9 This includes social protection
laws, policies, and strategic frameworks;
national-level coordination mechanisms between
ministries that oversee social protection; and
appropriate financing for integrated social
protection systems to function effectively.
Programme areas of child-sensitive social
protection systems. The programme level
is the operational heart of a social protection
system. There are different ways to look at
social protection systems including dividing
programmes into contributory and noncontributory programmes. For clarity on the
programmes that makes up a child-sensitive
social protection system, this framework divides
social protection programmes into four key
areas:
• Social transfers – This can include
cash transfers and tax credits but also
include in-kind transfers such as school
feeding subsidies or fee waivers. Social
transfers not targeted directly at children
(such as social pensions or maternity or
unemployment benefits) can also be crucial
in temporarily replacing lost income. Of all
social protection programmes, transfers are
often the most important in responding to
crises.

•

4.

Social insurance – Social insurance refers
to mechanisms that pool economic risks
across the life-course and can prevent
children and families from falling into
poverty when shocks or unexpected life
events occur. Common mechanisms of
importance to children and families include
health insurance and unemployment
insurance.
Labour and jobs – This includes
programmes and services that support
employment and livelihoods and enable
families to have sufficient income while
ensuring provision and time for quality
childcare. These may be broader labour
market programmes, or more focused on
children and families, including childcare
services and family-friendly workplaces
to facilitate employment, particularly of
women.
Social service workforce – The social
service workforce provides direct outreach,
case management and referral services
to children and families. While not always
explicitly included in social protection
frameworks, UNICEF considers this social
care function as integral to effective childsensitive social protection. They allow the
range of needs of families to be understood
and connect families to relevant services,
including those such as violence prevention
that may fall out of the social protection
sphere.

Administration and integrated service
delivery. The administrative level focuses
on the core tools that facilitate the business
processes of social protection programmes, and
these components are often vital entry points
for enhancing integration of social protection
systems. Administrative components include
integrated beneficiary and social registries;
management information systems (MIS);
delivery, grievance and redress mechanisms;
human resources; and sub-national coordination
mechanisms.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Shock-responsive social protection (cutting
across all levels of the social protection system)
Social protection systems should be able to support
children and families exposed to protracted, slow
and sudden onset humanitarian crises, as well
as economic crises. In order to become shock
responsive and ready to respond in the event of
a crisis, national social protection systems often
require some adaptation in the areas of evidence,
policy, programme and administration.
Box 2: What a child-sensitive social
protection system should offer every child
Understanding what a social protection system should
offer every child can help bring focus to what we are
trying to achieve. The goal of child-sensitive social
protection is for every child to:
1.

Live in a household with sufficient income
to develop and fulfil their potential. Sufficient
household income can not only impact children
access to services, but can increase children’s
sense of dignity and inclusion. Social protection
response ranges from employment programmes to
social transfers.

2.

Have access to quality basic social services
regardless of income or personal characteristics.
Social protection programmes can include those
that address financial accessibility such as fee
abolition or waivers as well as programmes that
support access to services of marginalized and
excluded children.

3.

When needed, have direct contact with an
outreach worker who can support families
and empower them to access key services and
information. Direct outreach can be essential to
understanding the vulnerabilities facing children
as well as providing referral to enable access to
appropriate services.

UNICEF's 10 key action areas in
supporting national child-sensitive
social protection systems
UNICEF has a long and growing history of working
on social protection with governments and partners,
and currently works on strengthening national
social protection systems in over 100 countries.
Drawing from this experience, this programme
framework identifies 10 action areas where we work
in partnerships to contribute to integrated social
protection systems.

As in all sectors, UNICEF country offices work
with national governments to determine the areas
of focus that would most benefit children and
contribute to agreed results. Accordingly, different
offices will work on different action areas, or indeed
there may be situations where a focus outside
these areas makes sense. Further, UNICEF’s work
on social protection has grown dramatically in
the past 15 years, and the maturity of our work
ranges from areas of deep experience within and
across countries (such as child poverty analysis,
building evidence and expanding and improving
cash transfers), to areas that are relatively new
but growing fast (such as shock-responsive social
protection), to others that despite their importance
remain relatively nascent (such as health insurance).
Our 10 key action areas are presented in more detail
in Table 2.

A vision of universal coverage, and a plan on
the steps to get there
UNICEF, along with other members of the Universal
Social Protection 2030 partnership, is committed
to social protection coverage for all. While gaps in
coverage are significant in many parts of the world,
progress in many countries shows that incredible
change is possible. These 10 action areas represent
UNICEF’s commitment to work with governments
and international and national partners to increase
the scale and scope of child-sensitive social
protection systems towards achieving universality.
They are integrated in our Strategic Plan as well as
our monitoring, reporting and financial indicators.
While the vision is large, the practical experience
of how to get there is significant. Each area is
backed by extensive knowledge about how to
make progress from a range of partners. UNICEF’s
key activities by action area are outlined in Table 2,
and the Companion Guidance to this framework
provides detailed activities, tools and resources
for each action area drawing from UNICEF and our
partners. Rapid progress towards universal coverage
is within our grasp and has the potential to have a
transformative impact on children’s lives and the
societies in which they live for generations to come.

Chapter overview

UNICEF has a rights-based approach to social protection and promotes universal social
protection for all. In working towards progressive realization of universal coverage, we
prioritize the poorest and most vulnerable children.
A key objective of UNICEF’s approach is to address child poverty and vulnerability by
breaking the cycle of disadvantage across generations and ultimately transforming the
lives of children and families.
The protection of families and children against a lack or loss of income as a result of
shocks and removing financial barriers to access services is at the heart of child-sensitive
social protection.
Child-sensitive social protection must include a strong focus on social vulnerabilities –
due to gender, disability, race and other social characteristics – with particular emphasis
on children who are both socially and economically vulnerable.
Social protection for children must fully consider the environments in which they live.
This means that child-sensitive social protection does not always equate to child-targeted
social protection.
The most vulnerable children may not live in families and require particular attention in
social protection and child protection approaches.

In 2012, UNICEF produced its Social Protection
Strategic Framework,10 which outlined the
conceptual underpinning of UNICEF’s approach to
social protection, identified key principles guiding
its work and discussed key policy issues. Since
then, social protection has expanded rapidly in
low- and middle-income countries, highlighting new
opportunities and challenges in realizing universal
social protection. UNICEF’s work has grown as well,
covering far more countries and facets of social
protection, and a growing number of UN agencies,
international financial institutions (IFIs) and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have become
active in the field. Against this backdrop, new
threats for children are emerging and accelerating –
from climate change to humanitarian crises – which
social protection can help to mitigate.
This updated framework refines UNICEF’s approach
to social protection to reflect this changing
landscape and highlights key action areas of our
work along with emerging good practice and
innovation in the field. While our work and approach
have changed over time, our conceptual approach to

social protection remains consistent: a rights-based
approach that promotes universal coverage for all
and prioritizes the poorest and most vulnerable
children.

A rights-based approach to social
protection
11

UNICEF’s mandate is rooted in the Convention on
the Rights of the Child (CRC), which guides our
rights-based approach to social protection. In the
CRC, social protection is most explicitly recognized
in Article 26, ‘States Parties shall recognize for
every child the right to benefit from social security’,
and Article 27, ‘States Parties recognize the right of
every child to a standard of living adequate for the
child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social
development’. Beyond this, the CRC more broadly
provides the foundation for UNICEF’s key principles
in our approach to social protection (see Box 3).
While the CRC focuses directly on children’s right
to social protection, the International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)

12

13

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

provides more prominent protection of the
right to social protection and is complemented
by the International Labour Organization (ILO)
recommendation 202.12 Thanks to these efforts,
there is now an enhanced understanding of the
scope and content of the right to social protection:

•

•

•

•

•

Universality: All persons should enjoy the
right to social protection (through contributory
and non-contributory schemes), in particular
individuals belonging to the most disadvantaged
and marginalized groups.13
Equality and non-discrimination: International
human rights treaties as well as most national
legal frameworks oblige all branches of the
State to ensure equality and to take measures
for levelling the playing field for the most
vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, ensuring
that rights apply without discrimination of any
kind (e.g. Article 2 of the CRC).
Progressive realization: State parties are
obliged to progressively ensure the right to
social protection for all individuals within their
territories using the maximum of available
resources (including resources that could
reasonably develop).14
Minimum essential level of benefits: In line
with progressive realization, States have an
obligation to provide minimum benefits for all
individuals that enable them to acquire at least
essential healthcare, basic shelter and housing,
water and sanitation, foodstuffs and the most
basic forms of education.15
Prohibition of deliberate retrogressive
measures: There is a strong presumption
that any measure implying a step back in the
protection levels accorded to economic, social
and cultural rights are incompatible with the
obligations imposed by ICESCR.16

When looking at child-sensitive social protection
specifically, a number of additional obligations
emerge from the conventions:

•

•

•

•

•

The best interests of the child: Children must
be the primary concern in decisions that may
affect them. This particularly applies to budget,
policy and laws (Article 3 of the CRC).
Indivisibility, equal importance, and
independence: Rights are equally important,
indivisible and independent and accordingly
other rights should be respected in ensuring
the right to social protection, and that to ensure
the right to social protection, fulfilment of the
others must also be ensured.
Participation: Children are entitled to have a
say in matters affecting their social, economic,
religious, cultural and political life (Article 12
of the CRC). Thus, State parties must involve
children, when they wish, in designing,
implementing and evaluating the social
protection policies and programmes that affect
them.
Age requirement: Under the CRC, a child
is defined as being under the age of 18, and
accordingly all children under 18 shall enjoy
the right to social protection even if living in a
country in which a child attains the status of
adulthood below the age of 18.17
Legal status: Under human rights treaties,
rights are granted to ‘all’, and not only to
nationals of the State parties. This means that
States party to international treaties must
ensure equal treatment in the enjoyment of all
rights, including the right to social protection,
both to nationals and non-national children,
including refugees, asylum seekers and
migrants, regardless of their legal status and
the documentation they possess.18

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Box 3: Four key principles that guide UNICEF’s approach
to social protection
The best interests of the child – UNICEF supports a rights-based approach to social protection rooted in the CRC, and
all our work in social protection is informed by one of its core principles: devotion to the best interests of the child. This
primary consideration underlies UNICEF’s flexible approach to working with partners on social protection driven by the
particular needs of children in different contexts, and integrated programming both within social protection and across
sectors.
Progressive realization of universal coverage – UNICEF supports the progressive realization of universal coverage.
This involves helping countries to identify and expand programmes, policies and financing options most conducive to
achieving universality, while also recognizing countries’ different capacities, contexts and challenges. Crucially, it also
means the right to social protection for children everywhere, including the fragile and humanitarian contexts where
children’s needs are often greatest.
National systems and leadership – UNICEF supports nationally-owned and led systems, including the development of
national financing strategies necessary for sustainable national systems. Only in exceptional cases where government
capacity to implement or coordinate is weak, including in some humanitarian contexts, would UNICEF consider
supporting implementation of temporary social protection programmes outside of government collaboration. This does
not preclude UNICEF from supporting others – civil society, children, etc. – in their initiatives to influence, participate,
and engage with social protection policy and programmes.
Inclusive social protection – Social vulnerabilities marked by characteristics and identities such as gender, ethnicity, HIV
status, geographic location and disability status fundamentally shape an individual’s exposure to risk as well as access
to essential social services and secure livelihoods. Inclusive social protection is responsive and sensitive to the needs of
all children by using specific social protection instruments that explicitly promote social inclusion and equity, and ensure
that programme design and implementation is sensitive to the added vulnerabilities that stem from social exclusion.

Addressing economic and
social vulnerabilities of
children and families
UNICEF’s approach to social protection is to support
governments in addressing the economic and
social vulnerability of children and families. UNICEF
fundamentally believes in social protection as a right
grounded in international treaties and conventions,
and works with partners to achieve universal social
protection along the life course (see Box 5 for more
on achieving universal social protection (USP) by
2030). However, we also recognize the challenges in
rapidly achieving universal social protection in many
different contexts. Accordingly, our approach is one
of progressive realization, starting with the poorest
and most vulnerable.
Economic vulnerability is a key driver of poverty. A
chronic lack of income or temporary loss of income
due to shocks such as illness, unemployment or
crop failure underpins monetary poverty and is
strongly associated with multidimensional poverty.
A child living in a monetarily-poor household is more

likely to be out of school, lack access to health
services and adequate nutrition. Accordingly, and
in line with the CRC, the protection of families
and children against lack or loss of income as a
result of shocks and removing financial barriers
to access to services is at the heart of social
protection.19
However, economic vulnerability does not stand
on its own in undermining children’s ability to
reach their full potential. It interacts with social
vulnerability, including intertwining vulnerabilities
due to personal characteristics such as age and
health status (e.g. disability and chronic illness), and
vulnerabilities due to social dynamics (e.g. social
discrimination and exclusion due to gender, race,
religion, disability, political affiliation, social norms,
geographic location and cultural practices). These
vulnerabilities may intersect: for example, people
living with disabilities experience vulnerability due to
both physiological constraints and a lack of visibility
and voice within society. As outlined in Chapter 2,
children living in socially-excluded and marginalized
households are less likely to attend schools and lack

14

15

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

nutrition and access to health services than those
who aren’t socially excluded.
UNICEF believes that removing financial barriers and
addressing social inequalities need to go hand-inhand to ensure that social protection is truly childsensitive.20 Economic vulnerability is all too often
intertwined with social vulnerabilities. Families living
in poverty that are also socially excluded face the
greatest disadvantages and require special attention.
As such, child-sensitive social protection must
include a strong focus on social vulnerabilities
and seek to address the additional risks faced
by children who are socially and economically
vulnerable at the same time.
This framing of child-sensitive social protection
is in line with the inter-agency definition of social
protection that UNICEF helped to develop and
supports:
`a set of policies and programmes aimed at
preventing or protecting all people against
poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion
throughout their life-course, with a particular
emphasis towards vulnerable groups’21

Figure 4 illustrates how social protection can
address economic and social vulnerabilities (which
may be exacerbated by shocks such as drought,
flood and conflict), address both child monetary
and multidimensional poverty, and have broader
transformative impacts. It does so by following
Devereux and Sabates-Wheeler’s framework,22
which sets out four overarching objectives of social
protection and frames them in relation to childsensitive social protection:
Protect the poorest children and families
against the hardship of poverty and
deprivation;
Prevent poverty and deprivation for children
and families that are vulnerable and at risk of
falling into poverty;
Promote economic opportunities and
human capital development to support
families to progress economically in support
of children’s development;
Transform the power imbalances in
society that create and sustain poverty and
vulnerability for children and families.

The provision of both responsive and proactive
responses to economic vulnerabilities constitute the
protective, preventative and promotive components
of child-sensitive social protection. An explicit focus
on social vulnerabilities through principles such as
acting in the best interest of the child and striving
for inclusive social protection – underpinned by
a rights-based approach – align child-sensitive

social protection with the more ambitious goal of
transformation. This represents a continuation of the
approach to social protection laid out in UNICEF’s
2012 Social Protection Strategic Framework.

Box 4: Children living outside
of households
While much of UNICEF’s work on social protection is designed to address economic and social vulnerability of
households, children living outside of family care are amongst the most vulnerable. These include children living
in alternative care arrangements as well as children in detention, children living on the street, and domestic child
workers. Although global estimates on children living outside of households are hard to establish, UNICEF estimates
that at least 2.7 million children are in residential care worldwide, reiterating that the actual number is likely to be
higher (Petrowski, Cappa and Gross, 2017).
A range of targeted child protection and social protection approaches are needed to reach these children. For
example, the 2009 Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children call for an end to institutionalization and
recommend prioritizing investments in child welfare and protection services that support families and communities
to prevent family separation. This requires a systemic transformation of the childcare, welfare and protection
system, including the establishment of a range of individualized support services, individualized plans for transition
with budgets and time frames, as well as inclusive, community-based support services, and a coordinated, crossgovernment approach.
In 2018, UNICEF supported 106 countries to address institutionalization and promote family-based alternative care.
The number of countries reporting availability of services to prevent unnecessary family separation has seen a
moderate but steady increase, rising from 54 countries and territories in 2017 to 58 in 2018. Notable improvements
include in Haiti, where 839 vulnerable families whose children were at risk of separation received assistance through
cash transfers, income-generating activities, parental education and psychosocial support. In North Macedonia,
UNICEF supported reforms to strengthen the design and quality of the country’s foster care system for children
with disabilities, preventive measures for early intervention, family support, and legal aid and assistance to families.
In Viet Nam, UNICEF provided support to improve national legislation and develop innovative alternative care
services for children without parental care and children with disabilities. Countries as diverse as Argentina, Bhutan,
Georgia, India, Indonesia and Malawi are among 46 countries and territories that report having monitoring and
inspection mechanisms in place for alternative care providers as part of efforts to strengthen quality of care. Notable
advancements were also made in India where, as a result of social audits of childcare institutions in the states of
Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, all districts are now developing indicators to monitor the quality and standard
of care in childcare institutions. For more information on connecting child protection and social protection services,
see Chapter 4 (Action Area 7: Strengthening the social welfare workforce and direct outreach to families) and the
Companion Guidance to this framework.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Implications of UNICEF’s approach to social
protection
This approach has important implications for how
UNICEF works with governments and other partners
in the design and implementation of social protection
systems. In particular, UNICEF aims to support:
(i) integrated social protection systems that provide
support across the life course and address the range
of social and economic vulnerabilities of children
and families, connecting programmes and services
across sectors; (ii) programmes that address
economic vulnerability; (iii) social welfare services
that can respond to the range of vulnerabilities
children and families face, providing direct support
as well as connections to relevant services; and
(iv) measures to address structural vulnerability
and exclusion, including through legislative or policy
frameworks empowering and linking marginalized
and excluded groups to access basic social services.
UNICEF’s approach to social protection takes into
account the different family and care arrangements
in which children live. Since the majority of children
live in families, child-sensitive social protection
does not always equate to child-targeted social
protection, as measures targeted at parents,
grandparents, workers or those without employment
are often equally beneficial to children in those
households. As the bulk of global social protection
spending goes towards such programmes, making
them child-sensitive is essential. While noting this,
however, it must never be forgotten that the most
vulnerable children often live outside of family
structures, and their range of needs requires a
combination of carefully-tailored social and child
protection responses (see Box 4 for more on children
living outside of households).

The scope of social protection can sometimes be
unclear and can vary across institutions, raising
questions both about what constitutes social
protection and how to work effectively across
government and non-government partners. UNICEF
takes a fundamentally pragmatic approach to the role
that social protection can play in realizing children’s
rights, and supports the provision of coordinated
and comprehensive responses. Many social
protection programmes reach the poorest and most
vulnerable children and create vital opportunities to
connect children to a range of services. UNICEF’s
approach to social protection is pragmatically
focused on linkages and appropriate integrated
programming in the best interest of the child.
The following chapters build on this conceptual
framework and its implications for our work. The
next chapter looks at the positive impacts social
protection can have on children’s lives. Chapter 3
then outlines how UNICEF sees the overall scope of
child-sensitive social protection systems, which we
hope will provide clarity in our work with partners
and governments. Following on from that, Chapter
4 then outlines UNICEF’s key action areas of work
with partners that contribute to the development
of nationally-led child-sensitive social protection
systems.

Rights (ICESCR), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), access to social protection is a fundamental
right, protecting people from economic and social vulnerability across their life course. Towards realizing this right,
a range of global and national partners have come together to achieve Universal Social Protection (USP) by 2030.
Launched initially by ILO and the World Bank, USP2030 now has 30 international and regional governmental and nongovernmental organizations and national governments as members.
The vision of USP2030 is ‘A world where anyone who needs social protection can access it at any time’. Universal
social protection refers to a nationally-defined system of policies and programmes that provide equitable access
to all people and protect them throughout their lives against poverty and risks to their livelihoods and well-being.
This protection can be provided through a range of mechanisms, including cash or in-kind benefits, contributory or
non-contributory schemes, and programmes to enhance human capital, productive assets, and access to jobs. This
includes adequate cash transfers for all who need it, especially children; benefits/support for people of working age in
case of maternity, disability, work injury or for those without jobs; and pensions for all older persons.
USP 2030’s call to action includes five action areas:
Action 1. Protection throughout the life course: Establish universal social protection systems, including floors,
that provide adequate protection throughout the life course, combining social insurance, social assistance and
other means, anchored in national strategies and legislation;
Action 2. Universal coverage: Provide universal access to social protection and ensure that social protection
systems are rights-based, gender-sensitive and inclusive, leaving no one behind;
Action 3. National ownership: Develop social protection strategies and policies based on national priorities and
circumstances in close cooperation with all relevant actors;
Action 4. Sustainable and equitable financing: Ensure the sustainability and fairness of social protection
systems by prioritizing reliable and equitable forms of domestic financing, complemented by international
cooperation and support where necessary;
Action 5. Participation and social dialogue: Strengthen governance of social protection systems through
institutional leadership, multi-sector coordination and the participation of social partners and other relevant and
representative organizations, to generate broad-based support and promote the effectiveness of services.
USP2030 and UNICEF’s approach to universal child benefits
No child’s potential should go unfulfilled due to the lack of a small amount of financial resources in the household.
Yet despite the proven benefits of cash transfers for children, currently only around 35 per cent of children live in
households that receive any form of family benefit. As part of UNICEF’s commitment to universality and USP2030, we
are exploring the pathways and possibilities of universal child benefits (UCBs) as an early foundation in establishing
universal social protection systems, and as a step change in promoting child outcomes and achieving the SDGs.
An ILO-UNICEF report showed that 21 countries have universal child benefits rooted in national legislation, with a
further 12 countries having schemes that could be considered quasi-UCBs. UNICEF and the Overseas Development
Institute (ODI) are investigating some of the key considerations around universal child benefit including the potential
in addressing exclusion errors to tackle child poverty and vulnerability; rights considerations; addressing stigma and
promoting dignity of recipients; as well as the practicalities of affordability and exploring how universal benefits form
part of a broader and appropriate social policy mix for children.

Chapter overview

Children are significantly overrepresented among those living in poverty and face additional
vulnerabilities compared to adults. This translates into potential lifelong adverse implications for
children and their futures, as well as societies and economies more broadly.
Social protection systems must increasingly respond to key emerging trends that have
significant implications for the situation of children, including climate breakdown, demographic
changes, urbanization, and conflict and forced displacement.
A growing body of evidence demonstrates the significance of social protection in addressing
the dimensions of child poverty with impacts across sectors and SDGs.
While the majority of this evidence currently comes from evaluations of cash transfers, these
are only one aspect of comprehensive social protection systems that address child poverty and
vulnerability.
While social protection systems are vital, alone they are not sufficient. They require a foundation
of quality services, which can be integrated with social protection systems where appropriate.

Social protection plays a crucial role in addressing
economic and social vulnerability across the life
course, including when unexpected shocks hit, by
supporting distribution within groups as well as
across generations. In this way, social protection
can be a foundation of the social contract and plays
an important role in building social cohesion. To
support these goals, an urgent priority of UNICEF’s
work on social protection is reaching the poorest
and most vulnerable children. For the majority of
children that live within households and families,
this requires comprehensive social protection
systems which may need to be complemented by
more child-targeted programmes.
This chapter discusses some of the foundational
challenges of child poverty and vulnerability to
which social protection must respond. It begins
by reviewing the latest evidence on poverty and
vulnerability and outlines key global trends affecting
children and their implications for social protection.
It ends with a review that underlines that by
addressing child poverty and vulnerability, social
protection can have a profound effect on children’s
lives, tackling multidimensional poverty with
significant benefits for societies and economies, but
to be effective social protection must be part of an
overall approach towards social policy for children,
founded on quality social services.

The state of child poverty and
vulnerability
For children, living in monetary poverty or being
close to it can mean facing insurmountable financial
barriers to accessing crucial goods and services, and
can be one of the factors driving multidimensional
poverty and preventing children from fulfiling their
potential.
In Goal 1 of the SDGs, Member States have
committed to routinely reporting on child poverty,
including ending extreme child poverty and halving
child poverty by national definitions by 2030. While
there has been progress in reducing poverty in
recent decades, 385 million children, or 1 in 5 (19.7
per cent), are still struggling to survive on less than
PPP$1.90, meaning children are more than twice as
likely to be living in extreme income poverty than
adults (see Figure 5). Looking slightly above this
extreme poverty line underlines the scale of the
challenge: about 45 per cent of children – over 1
billion children – are living in households subsisting
on less than $3.10 a day compared to 27 per cent
of adults.23 The data also shows that child poverty
is higher in the early years, linked in part to care
responsibilities in the household often borne by
mothers. Higher poverty rates for the youngest
children are of particular concern as evidence

increasingly shows the importance of investing
in early years for brain development and physical
growth, particularly during first 1,000 days of a
child’s life.24

included in the analysis, multidimensional poverty
rates are higher for children than for adults.26
Assessments of poverty at individual level as
opposed to household level are also growing. In
sub-Saharan Africa, for example, it is estimated
that two thirds of children experience two or more
deprivations of multidimensional poverty.27

These measures of poverty can obscure that child
poverty is a truly global problem, as must be the
social protection response. Data shows that 27
OECD countries that use relative poverty lines have
child poverty rates above 10 per cent, with only two
countries (Denmark and Finland) maintaining child
poverty rates below 5 per cent.25

Children’s economic and social vulnerability
Poverty measures, while important for social
protection policy and programme design, are often
static and can be blind to vulnerabilities children face
both at an individual and societal level. At the core
of the concept of vulnerability is the intention to
protect individuals from the negative consequences
of shocks – from illness to natural disasters – and
thus expand the focus of intervention from those
who are currently in poverty to all who are at risk of
becoming poor or deprived in the future.28

While monetary poverty is a key driver in child
outcomes, it doesn’t capture children’s true
experience of poverty. The SDGs explicitly include
multidimensional poverty, including for children,
which can better capture these realities and is
ultimately the challenge to which social protection
must respond. Data on multidimensional child
poverty has grown significantly since UNICEF’s last
social protection framework in 2012. The latest data
shows that a total of 665 million children – around
2 in 5 – live in multidimensionally-poor households,
and for all 105 lower and middle-income countries

A key group of economically-vulnerable children are
those that may not be captured under frugal national
or international poverty lines. Using higher poverty
lines (such as $3.10 or $5 line) may go some way
to capturing economically-vulnerable children, but it

is also important to recognize that for children and
families living above the poverty line, the risks of
falling into poverty remain. For example, in some
middle-income countries, people living on $6 a day
face a 40 per cent probability of living in poverty
in subsequent years.29 In Africa, a third of the
population is persistently poor, while another third
moves in and out of poverty.30
As outlined in Chapter 1, children and families can
also face social vulnerabilities due to how personal
characteristics ranging from age to gender to
disability status interact with social dynamics and
discrimination (see Box 6 for more information
on social protection for children with disabilities).
Analysing poverty with a gender lens generally
shows that girls and women are disproportionately
affected by poverty. These sex differences in poverty
are largest during the reproductive years, the time
when care and domestic responsibilities usually
assigned to women, overlap and conflict with
productive activities. This gendered aspect to poverty
is most pronounced among the poorest countries
and the poorest groups in societies. Social protection
policy, programming and administrative design can
have a significant and gender-differentiated impact
on outcomes for girls, boys, women and men.31
Data on social vulnerabilities is often considered
sensitive by governments and can be scarce.
Available evidence, however, consistently shows
that children of disadvantaged groups fare worse:
for example, Roma children – one of Europe’s largest
and most disadvantaged minority groups – face
significantly higher rates of poverty and lower access
to basic services, from healthcare to education;32
and across income levels, indigenous households
and children face glaring disparities in access
to services and vulnerability to exploitation and
poverty.33

The implications of child poverty and vulnerability
are felt most immediately by children themselves,
but they have profound implications for nations as
a whole as children become the next generation
of adults that build societies and drive economies.
According to the World Bank, for example, improving
health and education sufficiently to lift countries
from the 25th to the 75th percentile on the human
capital index would bring an additional 1.4 per cent
annual growth rate for 50 years.34
The range of vulnerabilities that children face
has profound implications for child-sensitive
social protection. The breadth of children that
may be economically and/or socially vulnerable
and the technical challenges in identifying these
vulnerabilities (such as exclusion errors in targeted
programmes), universal approaches are needed
to help ensure the children who most need social
protection are reached. Further, to ensure that
social protection systems fully consider social
vulnerabilities, actions ranging from appropriate
legislation to strengthening and integrating social
service workforce outreach and case management
are required to help understand and respond to the
range of social and economic challenges children and
families can face.

Box 6: Social protection for children with
disabilities
Children with disabilities are one of the most marginalized and excluded groups in society. Estimates suggest that there are
at least 93 million children with disabilities in the world, but data remains limited and numbers could be much higher. They
are often among the poorest members of the population, and frequently face societal stigma, discrimination and exclusion.
Furthermore, a lack of adequate policies and legislation limits their ability to access rights to healthcare, education, or have
their voices heard in society. Their disabilities also place them at a higher risk of physical abuse, and often exclude them from
receiving proper nutrition or humanitarian assistance in emergencies.
The importance of social protection for children with disabilities
Social protection has an essential role to play towards realizing UNICEF’s vision of a world where every child reaches their full
potential. Firstly, people with disabilities face greater exposure to risks and vulnerabilities. For children, this means significantly
lower access to healthcare and education and greater exposure to violence. For parents or caregivers, people with disabilities
– especially women – are much less likely to be in employment, resulting in higher rates of poverty and exclusion. Secondly,
people with disabilities face additional barriers in accessing employment, education, healthcare and disability-related services
both through a lack of disability-responsive service provision as well as stigma and discrimination. Essential assistive devices,
such as wheelchairs, canes and braille readers, can help address exclusion and improve accessibility of public services.
Effective and inclusive social protection is crucial in addressing these challenges, including addressing additional financial
barriers faced by children and adults with disabilities.
Building inclusive social protection systems that foster inclusion and participation
To address the risks, inequalities and barriers faced by persons with disabilities, a comprehensive and inclusive social
protection system should follow a ‘twin track’ approach: First, all social protection programmes should be designed,
implemented and monitored in a way that ensures the inclusion of persons with disabilities. Secondly, disability-specific
programmes should be developed to provide the support and benefits required by persons with disabilities that are not met
through a mainstream programme.
All social protection programming should include the following considerations in line with the Joint Statement towards
inclusive social protection systems supporting the full and effective participation of person with disabilities:
1.
Non-discrimination and accessibility. While most social protection schemes do not purposefully exclude persons with
disabilities, their design and delivery mechanisms may inadvertently prevent or limit their access to the relevant benefits,
unless disability inclusion is considered in their design and implementation.
2. Respect for dignity and personal autonomy, choice and control over one's life and privacy. Social protection benefits,
whether mainstream or disability-specific, should always be provided to persons with disabilities in a way that allows for
their choice and control over benefits.
3. Full and effective participation and inclusion. Social protection programmes should always contribute to full and effective
participation and inclusion. This calls for preventing the institutionalization of persons with disabilities. In the case of
children with disabilities, support needs to be given to the family, and the separation of the child from the family must be
prevented.
4. Consultation and involvement of persons with disabilities. Consultation with persons with disabilities is a right and
necessary for quality programming. Particular attention should be paid to the participation of women with disabilities,
caregivers and where possible children with disabilities themselves in non-disability specific programming.
5. Attitudes and awareness. Negative attitudes towards persons with disabilities and the lack of awareness of rights, laws,
regulations and programmes can also create barriers to social protection. Programme staff should be fully versed in the
rights of persons with disabilities and the provisions in their programmes guaranteeing inclusion.
6. Adequacy of benefits and support. Persons with disabilities, including children, often face significant additional costs,
and accordingly benefits should be defined on the basis of the specific requirements of persons with disabilities in their
diversity and not on a one-size-fits-all approach.
7.
Eligibility criteria and disability assessments. Disability assessments can add significant exclusion errors to those already
incurred in poverty-targeting approaches. Universal approaches to targeting can address these challenges, but where
assessments are carried out particular attention should be paid to prevent the exclusion of people with disabilities and full
consideration should be given to barriers faced by and the support requirements of people with disabilities.
8. Monitoring and evaluation. It is critical to ensure the disaggregation of administrative data to allow effective programme
monitoring as well as support programme evaluations to assess the effectiveness of programmes for persons with
disabilities.
Source: For more information, tools and examples please see the Joint Statement towards inclusive social protection systems supporting
full and effective participation of persons with disabilities co-signed by UNICEF and a range of other partners. The Statement remains open
for other partners to join.

Global trends and implications for
child poverty, vulnerability and
child-sensitive social protection

Beyond child- and family-level characteristics
driving poverty and vulnerability, macro-level global
trends also have profound implications for children.
Among the most notable are climate breakdown,
demographic changes, urbanization and conflict and
forced displacement. These interconnected changes
have a range of implications for the development
and expansion of social protection systems. For
example, with evidence suggesting that by 2030
half of those living in extreme poverty will live in
fragile or conflict-affected states,35 there is a need
to strengthen the capacity of national systems to
effectively respond to shocks and crises. Social
characteristics such as gender, age and disability play
an important role both in terms of the risks of being
affected by a shock, and the capacity to cope during
displacement or climate-induced shock. Recent data
suggests that women make up 50 per cent of those
who are displaced (refugees, internally displaced or
stateless populations) exacerbating existing gender
vulnerabilities.36

programmes and labour market interventions)
play a vital role in insuring vulnerable populations
against natural disasters as well as protecting living
conditions once a disaster hits. To address climate
breakdown and its impact on children’s social and
economic vulnerabilities to poverty, the following
should be considered:

•

•

•

Use risk analysis of populations living in areas
prone to impacts of climate breakdown, poverty
and food insecurity to inform social protection
systems and disaster risk mitigation.
Develop social protection programmes to be
ready to respond to increased propensity for
economic shocks, with a focus on addressing
risk and vulnerability of children and families
living in climate shock-prone areas.
Ensure that all aspects of national social
protection systems – from policies to operations
– are shock responsive, so that social protection
systems (including cash transfers) are ready to
respond to climate-induced disasters.

Climate breakdown
Climate breakdown is changing the world for children
in unprecedented ways resulting in immediate
effects and long-term implications for which future
generations will pay the heaviest price. Increasingly
frequent and severe climate-induced shocks such
as floods, droughts and changes in precipitation
as well as heat and water stress will continue to
have a devastating impact on living conditions,
particularly where many of the world’s poorest
and most vulnerable children live (see Figure 6
and Figure 7). Nearly 160 million children live in
areas of high or extremely high drought severity
and over half a billion children live in extremely
high flood occurrence zones.37 Poorer households
often also have less resources and capacity to cope
with climate-induced shocks as well as slow onset
changes such as sea level rise.
Beyond the impacts of climate-related natural
disasters, changes to the climate are altering
disease prevalence and pollution, affecting children’s
health, impacting food security and increasing
stress on often already stretched services. Climate
breakdown is also forcing families and children to
migrate, creating new challenges and risks. Social
protection mechanisms (such as asset insurance,
social pensions, social assistance, health insurance

Demographic shifts

many African countries to reap the benefits of a
demographic dividend over the next decades if
there are sufficient early investments in human
capital development.40 While in Asia, investments
in programmes that develop capabilities and
productive capacities of adolescents and youth
should be prioritized, in addition to early investment
in children and protecting the older population.

The world population is increasing and is projected
to reach 8.5 billion in 2050. Globally, the number
of adults and older people will increase more than
the number of children (see Figure 8), but there
are stark regional differences (see Figure 9). As
Figure 6 shows, from 2019 to 2050, Africa will see
the largest increase in the number of children in
both relative (55 per cent) and absolute terms (340
million), while the increase in Northern America
(7.2 million or 9 per cent) and Oceania (2.1 million
or 18 per cent) will be much lower. In Asia, on the
other hand, the number of children will decrease by
160 million (12 per cent), in Latin America and the
Caribbean the numbers will decrease by 31 million
(16 per cent), and in Europe by 13 million (9 per
cent). Due to its rising number of children, Africa’s
share of the total world population and share of
children under 18 will increase over the coming
years.

The impact of demographic changes on children
suggest the following considerations for social
protection systems:

•

•

These demographic changes have implications for
what types of social protection systems countries
should put in place and how these programmes
should be financed to address social and economic
vulnerabilities facing specific population groups.
For example, in Africa, while child populations are
increasing, overall fertility is going down.38,39 This
will provide an unprecedented opportunity for

Figure 8

•

A rising child population creates increasing
demand for education, health, social protection,
nutrition and water and sanitation services.
Investing now will result in future demographic
dividends.
A rising adolescent, youth and adult
population requires increases in jobs, skills
development for employability and livelihood
opportunities, and raises a counter-risk of rising
unemployment. It is important that programmes
are child-sensitive with appropriate policies for
the full participation of women.
A rising old-age population increases demand
for social pensions, requiring efforts to ensure
that social pensions are child-sensitive and
investments in children aren’t compromised.

Urbanization
In 2015, 54 per cent of the world’s population – close
to 4 billion people – lived in cities (see Figure 10). The
urban population is expected to rise by an additional
1 billion people by 2030, when cities will contain 60
per cent of the world’s population (see Figure 11).41
While Asia is continuing to urbanize rapidly, Africa
isn’t far behind, making it imperative for countries to
invest in a safe environment, social protection, and
better services and infrastructure for the increasing
number of families and children residing in urban
centres. In Africa, urbanization is occurring at a
lower level of income than in other regions and in
sub-Saharan Africa in particular, urbanization has
not coincided with economic growth: between
1970 and 2000 the urbanization level in sub-Saharan
Africa increased from about 20 per cent to 30 per
cent, while GDP per capita decreased over the
same period. Urbanization without shared economic
growth risks creating a class of people living in
poverty in slums at the margins of urban centres,
deprived of necessary services and security.
The social and economic vulnerabilities faced by
urban poor children are often hidden, and can be
perpetuated, by the statistical averages on which
social protection programmes and decisions about
resource allocation are based.42 Children living

in urban slums are often engaged in dangerous
and exploitative work. Although they live close to
services including health, electricity, education
and water and sanitation, children often don’t have
means to access them, and they can be of lower
quality than formal services.43 In addition, many
urban families work in the informal economy, without
access to social protection mechanisms. With rapid
urbanization happening in many African and Asian
countries, these social and economic vulnerabilities
will be further exacerbated, making urban centres
potential hot spots for poverty, social unrest and
epidemic outbreak if services, infrastructure and
social protection investment not prioritized. In
terms of urbanization and its impact on child socioeconomic vulnerabilities to poverty, the following key
actions are required:

•

•
•

Conduct analysis of urban child poverty and its
drivers to build a better understanding of specific
social and economic vulnerabilities faced by
children and their families.
Develop social protection programmes for
urban contexts that take into account specific
vulnerabilities of children and their families.
Expand social protection programmes to include
informal workers in urban centres.

conflict environment, often being displaced in their
own country or living as refugees in other countries
for many years. In 2017, children below the age of
18 comprised more than half (52 per cent) of the
global refugee population,45 while women and girls
comprised of around 50 per cent of all displaced
populations.46 People living with disabilities,
especially children, can be particularly vulnerable.
These numbers are even more alarming in light of
the average duration of displacement in protracted
refugee situations, which is an incredible 26 years.47

Conflict and forced displacement
It is estimated that by 2030 nearly half of the
population living in extreme poverty will live in
fragile and conflict-affected states with devastating
impacts on children. Conflict is a major driver forcing
families to move, and there are now more children
– an estimated 30 million – forcibly displaced by
conflict and violence than at any other time since
the Second World War (see Figure 12).44 Many of
these children and their families live in a protracted

These children are extremely vulnerable to poverty,
homelessness, abuse, school drop-out, lack of
access to health, proper nutrition, and adequate
shelter. They also face the worst forms of child
protection concerns including violence, exploitation
and abuse, separation from families, being born
in statelessness and risk to life. Armed conflict,
one of the major reasons for the recent spike in
forced displacement, is deeply rooted in social,
environmental and economic contexts, and
lack of inclusive social protection systems can
contribute to the triggers for political unrest. Social
protection systems can play a preventative role
in both fostering social cohesion and trust among
various heterogeneous communities as well as
mitigating the impact of displacement on vulnerable
populations, particularly children. The following are
the key implications that should be considered in
relation to conflict and displacement and its impact
on child-sensitive social protection:

Develop a better understanding of triggers of
conflict and political unrest and the role social
protection can play in addressing some of the
drivers, engaging a wide range of stakeholders
in national dialogues to foster social cohesion.
Improve planning and data management on
food insecurity, climate change risk analysis and
social and political context to address the drivers
of conflict and forced displacement, and to be
prepared to address the consequences of the
displacement due to conflict.
Strengthen national and sub-national social
protection systems to be shock responsive,
including in potential host locations, as well as
designing humanitarian cash transfers and other
social protection programmes to build on and/
or strengthen national systems while providing
immediate assistance.

The impact of social protection
across sectors and the SDGs
Integrated social protection systems can have
profound impacts on children’s multidimensional
poverty and vulnerability, both through programmes
that directly address children’s economic and social
vulnerabilities, providing families the security and
stability to make long-term decisions, and supporting
integrated multisectoral programming for children.
The prominence of social protection in the SDGs

recognizes the crucial role that social protection
plays in achieving results across sectors (see Box 7).
This section summarises these impacts, which
are reviewed in more detail in the Companion
Guidance to this programme framework. While
the preponderance of evidence generated draws
from the growing number of high-quality impact
evaluations on cash transfers,48 it is important
to stress cash transfers alone cannot fulfil social
protection’s potential to address child poverty and
vulnerability.

Social protection, monetary poverty and
productivity (SDG 1 and SDG 8)
A range of social protection programmes, including
active labour market programmes, social insurance
and social transfers, can directly address child
monetary poverty and the financial barriers families
face in accessing good and services. Social
protection programmes can have long-term impacts
including increasing entrepreneurship, supporting
longer-term economic decision-making and
improving access to labour markets. Even where the
impacts of programmes are not sufficient to move
families out of poverty, they can still have a positive
impact, for example there is overwhelming evidence
that cash transfers increase household expenditure
on education and food, and have a positive effect on

Box 7: Social protection in the SDGs
Social protection figures prominently in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The standalone target on social protection is included
in Goal 1:
Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere
Target 1.3: Implement nationally-appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030, achieve
substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.
Indicator 1.3.1: Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed
persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury victims and the poor and the vulnerable.
Social protection policies are also explicitly mentioned as contributors under:
• Goal 3: Universal health coverage.
• Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, including addressing unpaid care work.
• Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all,
including addressing child labour.
• Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries.
• Goal 16: Strengthening institutional frameworks.
Beyond the explicit mentions of social protection in the SDGs, other evidence outlined in this chapter demonstrates that social protection can
support the achievement of a range of other goals, including SDGs 2-6 (ending hunger, healthy lives, education, gender equality, and access
to water). Social protection is also a fundamental instrument for the achievement of pro-poor growth, employment and micro-, small- and
medium-enterprise development (SDGs 8-9) as well as for social inclusion, social cohesion, state building, political stability and international
co-operation (SDGs 16-17).

household productivity, including helping to facilitate
parental employment, and young people’s entry to
the labour market. Overall, a review of the evidence
suggests:

•

•
•

•

Social protection, including cash transfers, can
address child monetary poverty directly. Even
where transfers are not sufficient to move children
and families above the poverty line, they can
increase household expenditure and address
financial barriers across sectors. Social protection
also increases household productivity and has
positive multiplier effects in the local economy.
Aspects of design including programme coverage,
transfer size and frequency, are crucial to have an
impact.
Social protection programmes, including cash
transfers, have an impact on women’s economic
empowerment, particularly when programmes are
designed with gender outcomes in mind.
With extreme poverty being increasingly
concentrated in fragile and humanitarian settings,
ensuring social protection is shock responsive is
becoming ever more important.

Social protection and nutrition (SDG 2)
Direct interventions to address undernutrition, even
when scaled up to 90 per cent coverage rates, have
been estimated to address only 20 per cent of the
stunting burden. Tackling the underlying drivers of
undernutrition, including through social protection,
is key to addressing the remaining 80 per cent.49
There are strong links between social protection and
improved nutrition, with food consumption and diet
diversification a major focus of expenditure when
families living in poverty receive cash transfers.
By addressing poverty and underlying causes of
malnutrition, social protection programmes focusing on
first 1,000 days provide an unprecedented opportunity
to support the physical and cognitive growth of
children.50 Overall, a review of the evidence suggests:

•

•

Social protection programmes, including cash
transfers, show significant impacts on food
security, but alone do not always impact nutritional
outcomes for children. This may reflect relatively
short timeframes of many evaluations which
prevent nutritional outcomes being picked up.
In countries with high rates of undernutrition,
integrated social protection interventions with
nutrition support (‘cash plus’) could provide a
breakthrough, but more evidence is needed on the
best combination of packages.

Social protection and health (SDG 3)
Financial barriers contribute to food insecurity and
insufficient diets, reduced access to health services,
compromised hygiene environments, and inadequate
care practices, all of which contribute to poor health
outcomes. Loss of household income can also have
wide-ranging impacts including on children’s health,
nutrition and education. By addressing economic
security at the household level, including tackling
dynamics of social exclusion and linking marginalized
and vulnerable groups to health services, social
protection can improve child and maternal health.
Further, by many definitions, including the ILO’s
Social Protection floor, universal health coverage is
a fundamental aspect of social protection. Overall, a
review of the evidence suggests:

•
•

•

Social protection has a significant impact both on
the usage of health services and on mitigating the
financial impact of a health crisis in a household.
Evidence shows that cash transfers have a strong
impact on uptake of health services, and do not
need to be conditional to benefit child health
(UNICEF’s approach conditionality can be found
here).51
In many contexts, there may be opportunities to
combine health and social protection programming,
such as enrolment into health insurance schemes
or supply-side strengthening to enhance the quality
of services. More research is needed on this area.

Social protection and education (SDG 4)
Direct and opportunity costs of education are a
significant impediment to educational enrolment
and completion. Social protection interventions that
increase family income can have a direct impact on
education indicators and the education sector has been
a leader in social protection through fee abolition and
school meals (see Box 13 for more information). Cash
transfers have a positive impact on enrolment and
attendance, including strong results for girls, although
the impact on educational outcomes is more limited.
Overall, a review of the evidence suggests:

•

•

•

Social protection including cash transfers have
a significant impact on enrolment. Evidence on
educational outcomes is less clear, perhaps due to
the complex dynamics behind learning outcomes.
Both conditional and unconditional transfers
show impacts on enrolment, with some evidence
suggesting that monitoring and enforcement can
increase results, particularly for girls.
Combining social protection interventions with
support to adolescents in the form of additional

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

training and linkages to information and
services is an emerging area that may improve
adolescent transitions to adulthood.

Social protection and gender equality (SDG 5)
Social protection systems which address gendered
risks over the life-course and provide support in
situations of poverty, vulnerability or crisis, can play
a vital role in providing protection from poverty and
insecurity, helping cope with risks and recover from
shocks, and ultimately transform outcomes (for
UNICEF’s approach to gender and social protection,
see Box 8). Gender-responsive social protection
can play a crucial role in three areas: addressing
gendered life-course risks, often compounded by
multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and
harmful social norms; access to services, including
health, education, the labour market and protection
from violence and abuse; economic empowerment,
voice and agency, including decent and equal

working conditions including childcare, access to
assets and links to the labour market.52 Overall, a
review of the evidence suggests:

•

•

•

Social protection has significant potential to
contribute to tackling gender inequality, including
through helping reduce physical abuse and
increase decision-making power. However, social
protection is not automatically supportive of
gender equality and can even reinforce harmful
gender norms and practices if not designed and
implemented in a gender-sensitive way.
Social protection can support the reduction
of gender disparity between boys and girls,
especially in education, as well as support equal
access to opportunities in the labour market.
Integrated approaches to social protection offer
great potential in linking and strengthening
a range of services to address the
multidimensional nature of gender inequality.

Box 8: UNICEF’s approach to gender
and social protection
UNICEF is committed to gender equality and has integrated gender equality results across all areas of our strategic plan through (see UNICEF’s
Gender Action Plan 2018-2021). As poverty and vulnerability are inextricably linked to gender inequality, gender-responsive social protection is
essential to achieve the results of the Action Plan, including crucially reaching equality in health, nutrition and education and addressing genderbased violence. Further addressing gender inequality is fundamental to achieving the transformational change which is the ultimate objective of
social protection. Put simply, social protection can only be child-sensitive when it is also gender-responsive. Accordingly, UNICEF joined a range
of partners in a Joint Statement stressing the vital importance of equitable access to gender-responsive social protection to further women and
girl’s empowerment and opportunities, and recognizing its wider positive effects for men, boys, their families and communities.
UNICEF’s work on gender-responsive social protection recognizes that differential investments made in the development of boys and girls at an
early age progressively widens gender gaps as children grow up. These gaps compound the limited access to information of women and the
exposure, confidence and ability to engage in economic activities in labour markets which are often biased, restricting women’s options for full
and equal participation. While recognizing that women and girls often face greater disadvantage and exclusion boys may face particular challenges
which must also be considered in social protection programming. Following a life course-based approach, UNICEF works with governments, nongovernmental organizations and development partners to contribute to gender-responsive social protection at different stages of the life course
with two clear objectives:
Reducing gender disparities in human capital development:
• Supporting provision of regular adequate transfers and services to households with children to tackle the intergenerational transmission of
poverty;
• Linking social assistance and multi-sector humanitarian cash grants with equal access of boys and girls to nutrition, education, health,
protection, WASH and skills;
• Encouraging equal opportunities for birth registration of boys and girls, including where appropriate through universal child benefits;
• Strengthening implementation structures (local governments/social workers) to support gender empowerment.
Enhancing opportunities for women’s economic participation:
• Supporting ongoing efforts to advocate for inclusion of maternity and paternity benefits in policies/laws to ensure proper care of mothers
and children;
• Supporting provision of childcare in work-linked social assistance programmes;
• Facilitating access to identity documentation for regular and humanitarian cash programmes;
• Increasing information and knowledge on issues of gender inequality through monitoring, evaluation and research around social protection.
Integrated approaches to social protection also enable and strengthen links to a range of other services that can address gender inequality.
These include connections with the social welfare workforce that can extend support services to protect women from violence, and connecting
social protection programming to activities to change social norms and practices, essential to address issues of gender inequality. Genderresponsiveness should be fully integrated across all of UNICEF’s 10 action areas on social protection, based on a foundation of appropriate
gender data, evidence and analysis. For further detail, please see Annex 4 of the Companion Guidance on 'Integrating gender into social
protection programming: an emerging approach’.

Social protection, water and sanitation (SDG 6)

Social protection and child protection (SDG 16)

Despite being integral to child health and development,
WASH has generally received limited focus in social
protection programmes and impact evaluations and
relatively little is known about how addressing economic
and social vulnerabilities would affect key WASH
indicators. There is significant scope to increase focus
and research on social protection and WASH, with
behavior change through ‘cash plus’ approaches as a
potential entry point. Overall, a review of the evidence
suggests:

Poverty can exacerbate children’s vulnerability to violence,
exploitation, and neglect, and financial stress in families
can push children into risky coping mechanisms, such
as child marriage and child labour (see Box 9), including
in hazardous working conditions. Gender is an important
moderator of the relationship between poverty, economic
distress and adverse child protection outcomes. Child
protection and social protection are different but
complementary, and often work with similar partners.
Social workers can play a key role, through offering
families direct support and providing families with a link
to existing social protection and child protection services.
Overall, a review of the evidence suggests:

•
•
•

There is significant scope to increase consideration of
WASH outcomes in social protection programming.
Including relevant indicators in cash transfer
evaluations could clarify the role of changing family
income on WASH outcomes.
Including WASH components in ‘cash plus’ behaviourchange communication requires further research,
including linkages to nutrition where there is
extensive ongoing work.

•
•
•

The work of social protection to strengthen families
economically and socially directly affects child
protection results.
The role of social service workers and family outreach
is a crucial connection between social protection and
child protection.
Social protection and child protection must work
closely together. Social worker outreach is integral
to addressing social vulnerabilities by providing
information and referring families to key basic social
services.

Box 9: UNICEF’s approach to social
protection and child labour
UNICEF supports the achievement of SDG Target 8.7 which provides that States take “immediate and effective measures to
secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and
by 2025 end child labour in all its forms”. To support the achievement of Target 8.7, UNICEF pursues a integrated multisectoral
approach to child labour, including legal reform, education, social protection, access to health services and data collection,
and supports partnerships with UN agencies and other key stakeholders to mount a sustained effort to accelerate child labour
reduction across regions.
Child labour is both a cause and a consequence of poverty, reinforcing social inequality and discrimination. Studies in Togo and
Zambia show that households can respond to health shocks, such as the sudden illness of caregivers or primary wage earners,
by sending children to work (UNICEF, 2018). Social protection can play an important role in addressing poverty – a key driver of
child labour. While designing social protection programmes to address child labour, the following key considerations should be
kept in mind:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Link social protection programmes to support and promote birth registration and proper identification of household
members.
Use evidence on child poverty and child labour (overlapping deprivation analysis) and analysis of key risks factors of child
labour to help design social protection programmes.
Adopt an integrated approach to social protection by providing income security, access to healthcare through health
insurance and by removing financial barriers to education. In addition, complimentary measures such as ‘cash plus’
approaches on behavioral communication could be tailored for specific needs.
Ensure that social protection measures are ‘child-sensitive to child labour’ – addressing the unique social disadvantages,
risks and vulnerabilities children may be born into or acquire later in childhood due to external circumstances.
Develop tools and mechanisms for social protection systems to identify children protection cases who need additional
support, particularly child labour concerns which may require specialized support.
Develop further evidence and research on which social protection instruments help address child labour and how this varies
by context.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Social protection and HIV/AIDS
HIV/AIDS have a profound impact on children,
including directly from infection and the economic
and social impact on households in which children
live. Poverty is one of the structural drivers of riskseeking behaviour associated with HIV. Poverty also
disproportionately impacts people living with HIV due
to lost income and the increasing cost of accessing
treatment and care and support services. Research
has shown that social protection can help mitigate
risky behaviors associated with HIV, although impacts
can differ by gender, reinforcing the need for gender
responsive programme design and implementation.
There is also evidence on the positive impact of
integrated HIV-sensitive social protection programmes
on HIV prevention. Overall, a review of the evidence
suggests:

•

•

HIV-sensitive social protection, particularly cash
transfer progammes, have a positive impact on
mitigating the risky behaviors associated with HIV,
and supporting treatment and income support of
households with HIV-positive members.
Moving forward, more HIV-sensitive social
protection programming is needed, particularly in
high burden countries.

•

‘Cash plus’ approaches (a combination of cash
and linkages to existing services services) may
be more effective to address HIV outcomes than
cash alone.

Social protection as part of a broader social
policy mix
While the evidence on social protection generally
shows clear and positive sectoral outcomes, it also
highlights that social protection programming is not
a silver bullet that alone can address the holistic
needs of children and families. While many social
protection programmes can address the economic
and social vulnerabilities of children and families, they
don’t address information and knowledge gaps, the
availability of quality services, or the challenges that
vulnerable groups may face in accessing available
services. This underlines that while social protection is
a vital part of integrated programming for children, it is
far from sufficient to fulfil child rights. There is a clear
need for a foundation of quality and available services
for children and families, as well as integrated social
protection systems and inter-sectoral collaboration that
include care and support services, address information
and knowledge gaps, and enhance demand for
services linking to other programme areas.

Box 10: Addressing the myths around
cash transfers
While the evidence shows positive impacts across a range of positive outcomes for children, several myths remain regarding the perceived
undesirable impacts of cash transfers on fertility rates, misuse of social transfers and increasing dependency of recipients. These myths have
been disproven by the evidence.
Fertility
There are theoretical reasons to believe that cash transfers could either increase or decrease incentives to have children. On the one hand,
where transfers are targeted to households with children, it can be argued they will give families an incentive to increase the number of
children they have. Conversely, with poverty itself a factor underlying higher fertility rates, as cash transfers impact family incomes over time,
fertility may fall. The evidence, however, is clear: the vast majority of studies show either no impact on fertility, reductions in fertility and/
or changes in factors which can reduce fertility. Underneath this effect, evidence suggests that programme design that limits the size of
transfers to larger families will not affect fertility, but may have negative outcomes on children by reducing the purchasing power of families.
Misuse
A frequent assumption around social transfer programmes is that a significant proportion of people living in poverty will waste the funds
on products such as alcohol and tobacco. A significant body of research across Africa and Latin America consistently shows no evidence
of these types spending of cash transfers. Indeed, as outlined in earlier in this section, resources are used with a focus on investing in the
family, including child health and education.
Dependency
Concerns around dependency stem from the idea that those receiving cash transfers will be discouraged from working. Relatedly, some
assume that transfers can create a dependency mentality in which people start to expect continued assistance, underlying their motivation
and self-reliance. The evidence from a range of studies across contexts indicate that transfers are put to productive use, and rather than
encouraging dependency cash transfers actually improve labour market participation and create opportunities for beneficiaries to become
more self-sufficient by increasing productive investments.

Chapter overview
•
•
•

•
•

A child-sensitive social protection system responds to the range of social and economic
vulnerabilities faced by children and their families across the life course and is integrated to
avoid fragmentation and bring alignment across programmes.
Effective social protection systems require essential foundations at policy, programme and
administrative levels.
UNICEF also recognizes the importance of evidence in shaping social protection systems to
respond effectively to children’s needs. Accordingly, there are four components to how UNICEF
understands child-sensitive social protection systems:
○ A foundation of evidence;
○ The policy level: policy, legislation and financing;
○ The programme level: social transfers; social insurance; labour and jobs; social service
workforce;
○ The administrative level: administration and integrated service delivery.
With the poorest and most vulnerable children increasingly living in fragile and humanitarian
contexts, all components of social protection should be built to be shock responsive.
UNICEF works with a range of national and international partners in supporting governments
to develop child-sensitive social protection systems. UNICEF’s areas of contribution to building
these systems is outlined in Chapter 4.

Drawing on agreed approaches to social
protection,53 this chapter outlines UNICEF’s holistic
understanding of the components of a childsensitive social protection system. Developing and
sustaining these systems is beyond the scope of
any one actor and requires collaboration at national
and often international level. UNICEF’s key action
areas that contribute to the development of childsensitive social protection systems are laid out in
the following chapter.

Social protection systems:
protection across the life-course
There has been increasing recognition of the
importance of social protection systems and clarity
around their components since UNICEF’s previous
Social Protection Framework in 2012. The United
Nations vision is articulated in the UN Social
Protection Floor Initiative (SPF-I), launched in 2009
in response to the financial crisis and adopted
after wide consultation in 2012 by the UN General
Assembly and further reflected in SDG 1.3 that calls
for social protection systems, including floors.

Inherent to the social protection floor is the need
for social protection across the life-course that
addresses age-based vulnerabilities, and, as a
minimum, ensures the social protection floor
guarantees:54 access to essential healthcare,
including maternity care; basic income security for
children; basic income security for persons in active
age who are unable to earn a sufficient income; and
basic income security for older persons.55
As such, an effective and comprehensive social
protection system will include different types of
social protection programmes to address the varied
needs of different population groups (children,
adolescents, youth, working age, old age, disability,
women) and to bring coherence and coordination
to these interventions (see Figure 13). Such a
life-course approach offers child-sensitive social
protection in that it reaches children directly but also
recognizes their connection with adults at different
stages of their lives.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

The components of an integrated
child-sensitive social protection
system

Life-course transitions of women and girls
In general, women receive less social protection
coverage than other groups,56 yet across the life
course women and girls face particular life-course
transitions and risks which are often compounded
by multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.
At a young age, girls face barriers to quality
education, especially through their involvement in
domestic work. Adolescent girls are at risk of early
pregnancy and school dropout. Women are more
likely than men to work in precarious, informal jobs,
shoulder a greater burden of unpaid care, and face
interruptions and inequalities in paid work. These
life-course vulnerabilities accumulate, increasing
vulnerability in old age.57 Social protection systems
must also respond to address the life-course risks
hindering female empowerment and opportunities,
which impacts on families and communities (see
Box 8 on UNICEF’s approach to gender and social
protection).

Social protection systems can be broken down into
three constituent levels: policy, programme and
administrative.58 Building on UNICEF’s conceptual
framework and inter-agency approaches to social
protection, UNICEF follows this approach, but adds
one additional component that our experience
suggests is essential: to be effective, child-sensitive
social protection systems must be built on a
foundation of evidence on the situation of children,
impacts of current social protection programming
and remaining gaps. Figure 14 highlights these four
levels of the social protection system, which this
chapter will discuss in more detail, as well as the
cross-cutting importance of shock-responsive social
protection (see Box 11 for what social protection
should offer every child).

A foundation of evidence
A robust evidence base is a necessary foundation
for all elements of a social protection system,
particularly in a world that is rapidly changing due
to urbanization, conflict and forced displacement
and climate breakdown. Key areas of research and
evidence that are needed are:
Evidence on child poverty and vulnerability
for designing integrated social protection
programmes. Understanding the social and
economic vulnerabilities facing families and
children and their impacts on child outcomes and
multidimensional poverty is key to designing and
implementing effective social protection systems.
Evidence gathered should include gender analysis
as well as an assessment of potential vulnerabilities
resulting from shocks such as natural disasters
and/or conflict that could require crisis response or
resilience building.

Systems assessments, research and evaluation
on the effectiveness of social protection
programmes. While child poverty and vulnerability
analysis identifies the challenges to which social
protection needs to respond, it is also essential
to understand the effectiveness and efficiency
of programmes currently in place. This includes
providing the basis for adapting social protection
systems to support children and their families
both before, during and after crises. Programme
evaluations (including impact evaluations) and
operational research can provide an assessment of
the impact of programmes on desired outcomes
and identify gaps and challenges. Social protection
systems assessments are broader and analyze
social protection system performance against
national social protection objectives. They also map
alignment of different programmes, relevance of
programmes according to national objectives, and
efficiency in coordination and overall management
of social protection system.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Policy, coordination and financing of social
protection systems
The policy level is the highest level of engagement,
where a common vision is established, and the
objectives and functions of the social protection
system are defined in the context of national goals
and parameters.59 Key areas at policy level include:
Social protection laws and social protection
strategic frameworks. Grounding social protection
systems in a strong legal and institutional
framework is vital, as they provide both clarity of
vision and direction as well as a legally-guaranteed
foundation that supports programme sustainability
and underpins the transformative power of social
protection. Where the right to social protection
is enshrined in national laws, beneficiaries are
recognized as rights holders entitled to social
protection provision, aligned with relevant
Covenants and Conventions.60 Social protection
strategic frameworks then provide clear, actionable
and accountable plans to guarantee that the rights
of beneficiaries are realized and protected.
Coordination mechanisms. As social protection
systems cover a range of programmes and
ministries, effective coordination is essential.
A strong lead government agency or ministry
with political support and capacity is at the heart
of effective coordination, as is a coordination
mechanism that brings together and can hold
accountable the various entities that manage
different social protection programmes. This
includes coordination across and within ministries
(at national, regional and sub-regional level) in
areas such as education, health, nutrition and
disaster management. Such coordination is equally
important at service delivery level, where local
governments and local authorities play a critical role.
Financing social protection systems/
programmes. Even where social protection policies
and strategies exist, adequate and sustainable
financing and high quality public expenditure
management is essential for the progressive
realization of universal social protection. The

process of ensuring that social protection systems
are financed begins with costing assessments
of programmes guaranteed in law and identified
in social protection strategic frameworks. It also
requires engagement in the budgeting process and
fiscal space analysis for identification and allocation
of needed domestic resources including progressive
taxation systems and appropriate financial controls.
As national budgets represent national political
processes, this requires political recognition of
the value of social protection, and full integration
of social protection into budgeting processes.
For social protection to respond in times of crisis,
provision of contingency funding in budgets is also
essential.

Programme areas of child-sensitive social
protection systems
The programme level is the operational heart
of a social protection system. In an integrated
system, social protection programmes should both
cover the range of vulnerabilities across the lifecourse to provide adequate coverage to all who
need social protection as well as work together
through a shared policy framework and operating
mechanisms. There are different ways to look
at social protection systems, including dividing
programmes into contributory and non-contributory
programmes. For clarity on the programmes
that makes up a child-sensitive social protection
system, this framework divides social protection
programmes into four key areas:
Social transfers
Social transfers can include cash transfers and tax
credits but also include in-kind transfers such as
school feeding subsidies or fee waivers (see Box
13), and can differ in how they are targeted and how
they are delivered. Social transfers are the most
direct way to protect children and families against
poverty and address the financial constraints they
face, including those related to the care burden
often borne by women and girls. Of all social
protection programmes they are often the most
important in responding to crises. Transfers not
targeted directly at children, such as social pensions

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

or maternity or unemployment benefits, can also be
crucial in temporarily replacing lost income. Due to
their broad reach and periodic contact with families,
social transfer programmes also offer an excellent
opportunity to connect families to vital information
and access basic social services.
Social insurance
Social insurance refers to mechanisms that pool
economic risks across the llife-course and can
prevent children and families from falling into
poverty when shocks or life-events occur that either
draw heavily on families’ economic resources or
have a negative effect on their livelihoods, such
as ill health, old age, unemployment or broader
risks such as droughts, floods or extreme weather
events. Common mechanisms of importance to
children and families include health insurance and
unemployment insurance.
Labour and jobs
This area involves programmes and services that
support employment and livelihoods and enable
families to have sufficient income while ensuring
provision and time for quality childcare. These may
be broader labour market programmes, or initiatives
focused on children and families including childcare
services; family-friendly workplaces to facilitate
employment, particularly of women; maternity and
paternity leave; or skills-building for adolescent
employability. Given the vital role of the private
companies in employment, engaging with both
public and private sectors is important (see Box 12).
Social service workforce: outreach, case
management and referral services
While not explicitly included in the social protection
frameworks of all organizations, UNICEF considers
outreach, case management and referral services
integral to effective child-sensitive social protection.
They allow the needs of families to be understood
and for families to be connected accordingly
to relevant services, including those such as
violence prevention and response. While these
approaches may be undertaken by the social welfare
workforce, they may also be implemented by or in

collaboration with community-based volunteers and
paraprofessionals. The social services workforce
also plays a critical role in the social protection
response to humanitarian situations.

Administration and integrated service delivery
The administration level focuses on developing the
core tools that facilitate the business processes
of social protection programmes. These different
administrative system components within a
particular social protection programme are often
useful entry points for enhancing integration of
social protection systems, including facilitating
linkages across sectors. Making operating
mechanisms flexible and shock-responsive is also
essential. The following are the key components
of a robust administrative system for an integrated
child-sensitive social protection system:
Integrated beneficiary registry and social
registry:61 Integrated beneficiary registries and
social registries are part of broader MIS. Integrated
beneficiary registries help in the enrolment and
notification phases along the delivery chain for a
social protection system, as well as the broader
MIS on beneficiaries by supporting outreach, intake,
registration, and determination of potential eligibility
for one or more social protection programmes.
Social registries serve for all ‘potential’ beneficiaries
while beneficiary registries are only for those
included in relevant programmes. An ‘integrated’
beneficiary registry supports multiple programmes,
helping administrators avoid unintended
duplication.62,63
Management information systems (MIS):
Programme monitoring and implementation relies
on MIS providing necessary data to implementers
and decision makers to conduct payment
appraisal and to identify the gaps, challenges and
successes in programme implementation. A sound
MIS supports the efficient administration and
implementation of the programme. Information
systems can also reduce errors and fraud and can
speed up necessary steps in the implementation
process. Integrated MIS used by multiple

38

39

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

programmes can promote efficiency and synergies
across programmes.
Benefit delivery mechanisms:
There are different types of benefit delivery
mechanisms depending on the type and nature
of social protection interventions. For example,
in-kind transfers might use local vendors/shops or
other point of delivery while cash transfer or other
benefit types may require banks, mobile wallets,
tax credits and other forms of payments. Whatever
the mechanisms, the underlying objective should
be to make them efficient and inclusive and for
beneficiaries to access the benefits without undue
out of pocket expenditure or unnecessary loss of
time. Data security, personal and life security and
specific venerabilities facing beneficiaries must
be considered while designing benefit delivery
mechanisms. The global recognition of cash as a
modality both in development and humanitarian
settings is drawn from the fact that it could increase
financial inclusion and exposure to technology by
opening bank accounts or accessing mobile wallets
or having a cell phone. There are many methods of
cash payment, many of which are increasingly used
in humanitarian response, but the most prevalent
are: mobile money transfers, smart card payment
systems, bank transfers and hawala or third-party
vendor/local agents.64,65
Grievance and redress mechanisms:
Mechanisms to report and respond to concerns
and allow feedback to improve the delivery of
social protection are an essential part of a good
administrative system. There are different methods
used for grievance and redress mechanism, the
most notable being call centres, toll-free hotlines,
community grievance committees and social audits.
There is also a need for an appeal mechanism
through the formal judicial appeal system to address
exclusion from the programme if grievances aren’t
addressed by other mechanisms.66

Human resources, including for social work and
case management:
Effective integrated social protection relies on
sufficient, qualitied and trained professionals
that may include qualified social workers, data
managers, accountants, finance specialists,
strategists, actuarial experts, planning and
management specialists etc. For the purposes of
children all of these functions are important, with
a stronger emphasis on the social workforce to
provide case referrals and management. Ensuring
the system has capacity to provide social care
and case identification and referrals to appropriate
programmes is important in ensuring the effective
integration of the social protection system, including
addressing the social and economic vulnerabilities
of families.
Sub-national coordination mechanisms:
Sub-national coordination mechanisms at
governorate and/or district level play a vital
role both in terms of implementation of social
protection programmes but also ensuring sectoral
coordination and policy coherence. Often capacity
constraints, lack of resources, authority to make
decisions and establishment of proper coordination
mechanisms at sub-national level hinder programme
implementation.

Shock-responsive social protection – cutting
across all levels of the social protection
system
In addition to addressing longer-term poverty and
social vulnerability, social protection systems
should be able to respond to crises and support
children and families exposed to protracted, slow
and sudden onset humanitarian crises, as well as
economic crises. Government social protection
systems can be highly effective mechanisms to
support larger emergency response. Effective
social protection systems already have measures
in place that are essential for supporting people in
times of crisis, however, in order to become shock
responsive, national social protection systems often
require some adaptation. As outlined in Figure
14, these changes cut across all areas of a social

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

protection system, at evidence, policy, programme
and administrative level (for more details on
UNICEF’s approach to shock-responsive social
protection, see Box 14). A shock-responsive social
protection system includes:
Social protection system preparedness:
With the growing recognition of the role of cash
in humanitarian response, this may involve a
particular focus on the readiness of national social
assistance programmes and how they link to
national emergency response processes. However,
this can and should include links to other important
services, including case management services for
vulnerable children and families, and connections to
key services such as health and education.

The use of national social protection systems
during a crisis:
Where possible, national social protection systems
should be used as part of humanitarian response.
Where government systems are not strong enough
to be used in their entirety or where they are not
an appropriate support option, parallel mechanisms
should be aligned as closely as possible to support
affected populations while also supporting the
building of nascent national social protection
systems for longer-term use and strengthening the
humanitarian-development continuum.

Box 11: What a child-sensitive social protection system
should offer every child
Understanding what a social protection system should offer every child can help bring focus to what we are trying
to achieve. Child-sensitive social protection aims to ensure that poverty does not prevent children from realizing their
rights and fulfilling their potential. As poverty is often caused or compounded by social discrimination (based on gender,
disability, ethnicity, language groups and/or other identities), social protection must also address these compounding
social vulnerabilities. Achieving this requires social protection interventions which go beyond financial support to ensure
effective access to services.
Accordingly, the goal of child-sensitive social protection is for every child to:
1.

Live in a household with sufficient income to develop and fulfil their potential. For many households, income
can be provided through paid work, for others, programmes that support access to employment or incomegenerating activities can help. The quality of employment is also crucial, both in terms of income earned and in the
provision of benefits and paid leave which can be crucial for children’s development. In the event that household
income is insufficient, social transfers or insurance to address economic barriers – based on progressive realization
of universal coverage – can help. Sufficient household income can not only impact children access to services, but
can increase children’s sense of dignity and inclusion.

2.

Have access to quality basic social services regardless of income or personal characteristics. Access to basic
social services is key for ensuring child well-being. Sufficient income plays a crucial role in ensuring access, but
additional programmes can help make critical services accessible, including addressing social marginalization and
exclusion. These include programmes that address financial accessibility such as school feeding programmes, fee
abolition or waivers, grants and scholarships, health insurance, as well as programmes that support marginalized
and excluded children to access services.

3.

When needed, have direct contact with an outreach worker who can support families and empower them to
access key services and information. Direct outreach and contact with families can be essential to understanding
the vulnerabilities facing children and families, and a focal point can act as advocate to help children and families
realise their rights to access basic social services. Referral to and support with accessing appropriate services,
ranging from cash transfers, knowledge and information to sectoral programmes, is vital. The role of focal point
may be fulfilled by social workers, community workers or community volunteers.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Box 12: Social protection and the
private sector
The private sector has an important role to play in the development of comprehensive child-sensitive social protection
systems. Governments can draw on the private sector as service providers to support the delivery of government-led
programmes. And while social protection is provided by the state, private sector employers play an important role in ensuring
compliance with the national labour and social security legislation of their employees as well as providing additional benefits
themselves. Companies can also promote extension of employment-linked social protection through their supply chains
relationships. The private sector is also a crucial contributor to the tax base to ensure the sustainable financing of national
systems.
Social protection also benefits business. Strong social protection systems provide a conducive environment for the private
sector to thrive, ranging from boosting the local economy to supporting social and political stability. Accordingly, the private
sector can play a crucial role in the policy-making process through employers and organizations contributing to national
dialogues on social protection.
The private sector as service providers supporting the delivery of national social protection programmes
Provision of social protection is primarily the responsibility of the state and a foundation of the social contract. However,
the private sector may play a role in supporting programme delivery, including through innovation and technology. For
UNICEF, this support to delivery is currently the principle area of engagement with the private sector on social protection.
An important example is the rapid expansion of cell phone infrastructure which is supporting the payment of cash transfers
in many contexts, including some of the most challenging. Not only has this allowed programmes to expand, working with
the private sector in payment delivery also offers the potential to promote the financial inclusion of recipients. The private
sector can also support delivery in other areas, for example by providing the technology for management information systems
(MIS) and biometric identification, and ensuring personal data protection and privacy. In many contexts, the private sector is
also a provider of childcare services, and has a crucial role to play in supporting adolescents transition into work by offering
apprenticeships, training schemes and internships.
In all engagements with the private sector, UNICEF follows its principles of engagement. When supporting governments
to develop social protection programmes, there are some specific considerations to take into account regarding the private
sector:
• Accessibility and quality of provision are essential as the objectives of governments and private sector counterparts may
not align (for example, in regulating and monitoring the quality of childcare provision).
• Work within certain areas of social protection programmes –such as payment systems, MIS development or biometric
identification support – provides access to large quantities of sensitive individual data. Ensuring this data remains
confidential and is used appropriately requires regulation and oversight by national governments.
• UNICEF has to be careful not to confer a competitive advantage to a private sector company and must ensure proper
approaches to the procurement of services, including when working through government systems.
• Finally, as social protection is primarily a government responsibility, the involvement of the private sector should not erode
the core service provision functions of government, including prioritising the most vulnerable groups whether as a result
of gender, disability, geographic location or other personal or social characteristics.
Private sector enterprises as contributors to social protection as employers and as part of supply chains
The great majority of the world’s economically-active population work in the private sector, ranging from large multinational
corporations to small informal enterprises and entrepreneurs. The quality of that employment, and the benefits provided, play a
fundamental role in ensuring social protection for workers and their families.
Private sector enterprises play an important role in social protection systems by ensuring full compliance with national labour
and social security legislation, ensuring that employees, as well as their families, are covered by adequate social protection,
including health insurance, maternity protection, unemployment protection, contributory family benefits, as well as old age,
survivor and disability pensions.
Social protection benefits for employees and their families can ensure a high level of protection that contributes significantly
to the overall social protection system in a country. A crucial consideration for children, especially those living in poverty, is
that such employment-related provision is part of a strong and universal national social protection system, in addition to noncontributory (e.g. tax-financed) benefits, ensuring universal coverage with comprehensive and adequate benefits.
In addition, private sector enterprises can also play a key role in promoting social protection for their own workers by
incorporating relevant criteria on social protection, decent work and core labour standards into their business operations and
due diligence mechanisms. Social audits reveal that, in some cases, over 50 per cent of the workers of the first tier of the
supply chain are not covered by any social protection mechanism.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

As over 2 billion workers were in informal employment in 2016, accounting for 61 per cent of the world’s workforce, noncontributory government-provided social protection provision remains essential to cover those workers who are not (yet)
included in contributory mechanisms. While not currently an active area of engagement for UNICEF, partners such as the
ILO support governments in their role in fostering the transition of enterprises and workers from the informal to the formal
economy. This fosters the extension of social protection coverage and ensures the quality of benefit provision. As the
coverage of contributory social protection schemes increases, social protection improves overall and the pressure on noncontributory approaches reduces.
Beyond provision of benefits, UNICEF’s is working on a family-friendly workplaces initiative with the private sector.
Collaboration ranges from ensuring access to breastfeeding rooms to teleworking, and can greatly facilitate the return to
work of parents, particularly mothers, and is relevant to all families balancing employment and family responsibilities.
The benefits of social protection for the private sector
As much as the private sector can contribute to social protection, they can also benefit from it. Strong social protection
systems help the private sector grow and are an important precondition of sustainable enterprises. Social protection is an
important instrument of ensuring sustainable investments into a healthy and qualified workforce. In addition, social protection
programmes can boost local economies: recipients of cash transfers, for example, spend transfers locally and estimates
suggests the multiplier effects mean a dollar spent on a cash transfer, leads to $2.5 dollars in local economic benefits. At a
more macro level, social protection systems also contribute to stabilizing or boosting aggregate demand, especially during
times of economic downturn.
More broadly, by strengthening the social contract social protection contributes to social and political stability, crucial
foundations of a strong and expanding private sector. And evidence suggests that for multinational enterprises, social
protection can increase productivity and market value: the provision of social protection benefits for workers and their
families can help companies attract and retain talent, and by promoting social protection across the supply chain and broader
communities, private sector enterprises can also convey a positive and socially-responsible image that can benefit them in
the market-place.
The potential of the mutually reinforcing positive relationship between national social protection systems and the private
sector can be supported through the important role of the private sector in national social protection dialogues through
employer organizations. This is reflected in the ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202) and the
Recommendation concerning the Transition from the Informal to the Formal Economy, 2015 (No. 204) to which organizations
of employers contributed. Such forms of engagement at the national level can help the government, private sector and
other stakeholders understand and realise the potential of working together to build strong and sustainable national social
protection systems.

supporting child-sensitive social
protection systems

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Chapter overview
Building on the core strengths that guide our work, this chapter identifies 10 key action areas of UNICEF’s work in
supporting child-sensitive social protection systems. In all cases (except in some humanitarian contexts) UNICEF
works together with governments on national priorities and in partnership with international and national partners.
The 10 action areas are:
At evidence level:
1. Child poverty analysis, impact evaluations and systems assessments
At policy level:
2. Policy and strategy development, coordination and financing
At programme level:
3. Expanding and improving cash transfers for children
4. Connecting cash transfers to information, knowledge and services
5. Expanding and improving health insurance
6. Supporting childcare and adolescent employability
7. Strengthening the social welfare workforce and direct outreach to families
At administrative level:
8. Strengthening integrated administrative systems
On shock-responsive social protection:
9. Strengthening national shock-responsive social protection systems
10. Linking humanitarian cash transfers to social protection systems
Different action areas are at different levels of maturity within UNICEF’s work, and areas of focus will vary
significantly by country according to national priorities.

With the goal of addressing child poverty and
vulnerability and progressively realizing the universal
right to social protection, building child-sensitive social
protection systems is a long-term task that requires the
coordination and collaboration of multiple national and
often international partners. This chapter outlines the 10
key action areas that UNICEF works on together with
governments and sister UN agencies, as well as other
international and national partners (See Table 3 at the
end of this chapter for a summary of UNICEF's Action
Areas and key activities, and Annex 1 for more on the
social protection approaches of partners). These have
developed over the 15 plus years UNICEF has been
working on social protection in over 100 countries in all
development contexts. The action areas respond to the
key gaps in child-sensitive social protection UNICEF has
identified through our work and research, and that are
outlined in each area.67

Core strengths which guide the work
we do
Drawing from our global experience on social
protection, a number of UNICEF’s core strengths guide
both the areas in which we are and should be working,
as well as the types of activities we undertake to
contribute to the development of child-sensitive social
protection systems. These are:

A clear and holistic focus on the best interests of
the child, grounded in child rights. UNICEF’s core
mandate is based around child rights, which means a
focus on equity and the most deprived, including those
facing discrimination and disadvantage due to gender,
disability, ethnicity, language, health status or location.
UNICEF’s key principles for our work in social protection
stem from our focus on child rights and determination
to progress the situation of children (see Box 3).
Support to integrated national social protection
systems beyond a child focus. UNICEF’s clear focus
on children can sometimes be misinterpreted as
working on child-focused social protection only. Effective
child-sensitive social protection requires a focus
beyond children, to integrated nationally-led systems of
protection throughout the life-course. As UNICEF’s work
on social protection has grown over the past decade,
national systems-building has become a major focus of
our work.
Working in partnerships with government, sister
UN agencies and other international and national
partners. At the heart of UNICEF’s work in all areas,
including social protection, is working collaboratively
with partners. We always work together with
governments on their national priorities, except in

44

45

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

exceptional humanitarian contexts where this is not
possible. We also work extremely closely with sister
UN agencies, as part of the UN’s commitment to
deliver as one, as well as with NGOs and development
partners. Based on these relationships and the trust
of partners, UNICEF often plays a convening role in
supporting governments in bringing partners together
to reach consensus.
Extensive on the ground experience and presence.
UNICEF not only works with partners in over 100
countries on social protection, but we work deeply
within these countries. Working across different
sectors or ministries as well as different levels
of government including local governments and
communities at regional, district or sub-district level.
Accordingly, our work is connected from the policy
level to a detailed knowledge of the challenges and
opportunities on the ground in strengthening social
protection programming.
Experience and expertise in multisectoral
programming. UNICEF has extensive experience in
multisectoral programming for children, including longestablished relationships with government sectors
as well as non-government institutions. This makes
UNICEF extremely well placed to connect social
protection and sectoral programming, and consider
financial and non-financial barriers children and families
face in holistic and practical ways.
Expertise on child poverty analysis, policy and
programme research and evaluation. UNICEF is
a global leader on child poverty measurement and
analysis. Working with partners, UNICEF has extensive
expertise and experience in researching and evaluating
social protection programmes, identifying strengths
and key gaps in social protection programmes and
systems for children. As a result, we are able to work
with governments and partners to create systematic
assessments of child poverty, which identify how the
social protection system is, and is not, responding.
Bridging the gap between fragile and humanitarian
contexts. UNICEF is on the ground and working in all
circumstances in over 190 countries and territories.
We work across development, fragile and humanitarian
contexts and are present before, during and after
crises. Social protection has a crucial role to play in
building readiness for crises and responding when
a crisis hits, and UNICEF is well placed to support
preparedness of social protection systems for
children and the use of national systems in fragile and

humanitarian contexts. This is particularly important
given the consensus around the use of cash transfers
as a first line of response to support affected
populations in emergencies

Four key caveats in understanding
our action areas

A suggestion not a prescription. The independence
of UNICEF country offices in working with national
governments to determine areas of focus that would
most benefit children – which is the heart of UNICEF’s
innovation, leadership and results – may lead to a
focus on social protection by UNICEF country offices
not included in these ‘core’ action areas. While this
package hopefully provides useful direction for many
contexts, it should of course not be at the expense of
what is in the best interests of children.
It’s not all or nothing. In many contexts, UNICEF
country offices may focus on one or two action areas
rather than all elements. In some contexts, work may
be sequential (working with government and other
partners to build a national cash transfer may make
sense before focusing on integrating programmes), in
others political opportunities or the reality of available
capacity may make focusing on a single element most
effective.
Different areas of work are at different stages of
maturity. UNICEF’s work on social protection has
grown dramatically in the past 15 years. In some of
the key action areas identified, such as child poverty
analysis and expanding and improving cash transfers
for children, our work is at scale within and across
countries. In others, such as shock-responsive social
protection, the work is relatively new, but growing fast.
In others, such as health insurance, the work, despite
its importance, remains nascent for the organization.
Social protection, and who works on it, can have
blurry edges. Many of us working on social protection
find ourselves in conversations about what’s included
in our understanding and definition of social protection
– including the role of UNICEF and our Social Policy
teams specifically. While this set of core work aims
to articulate key areas where we often work in social
protection, country approaches to structuring the
work will vary depending on the needs of children and
existing government and office structures. Globally, the
package aims to outline key areas where we need to
provide coordinated support – including working across
sections and divisions.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Action Area 1 Child poverty analysis, impact evaluations and systems assessments
To build effective social protection systems, having
an evidence-based understanding of the situation
of children and child poverty and the effectiveness
of the current social protection system and
programmes, including a gender analysis, is
essential. UNICEF, together with partners, has
developed significant expertise in these areas and
has become a leader in child poverty measurement
and analysis, working in over 80 countries in the
past few years and are doing extensive evaluations
and programme assessments.

Child poverty measurement and analysis
Despite the importance of child poverty
measurement and analysis, many countries are
not measuring child poverty at all, and many others
are not doing so routinely (see Figure 15). Latest
estimates suggest that 74 countries now measure
and report on monetary child poverty and 55
countries measure and report on multidimensional
child poverty (see Figure 16). In most countries
gender considerations, although not always a full
analysis, is included. Further, for many countries,
linking child poverty evidence to social protection
policies and programmes has been limited.

UNICEF has also undertaken systematic analysis
of the overall social protection systems in some
countries, and is working to address significant gaps
in evidence on gender-responsive social protection.
This work is in undertaken with governments
and UN and non-UN partners, for example the
Transfer Project research initiative on cash transfers
with FAO; DFID and the World Bank on gender
responsive social protection; and with the ILO,
World Bank and other partners in implementing
Inter-Agency Social Protection Assessments (ISPA)
tools.

Addressing these gaps is a core area of strength for
UNICEF with work ongoing in 137 countries. Work
includes capacity building and technical support
towards routine measurement of monetary and
multidimensional child poverty as well as supporting
policy and programme analysis and implications for
social protection systems. Vulnerability analysis is
more limited, particularly in the context of preparing
national systems to respond to crisis, but will grow
as our work on shock-responsive social protection
develops.

In this action area, UNICEF works with partners on
the following issues:

Impact evaluations
The need for impact assessments remains strong
in many country contexts, while existing work and
evidence may be sufficient in some cases. As is
outlined throughout this framework, the world has
made substantial progress in building evidence
on the impacts of social protection. The largest
body of work has focused on the evaluation of
cash transfers. The Transfer Project has supported
evaluations on cash transfers in Ethiopia, Ghana,
Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, South Africa, Zambia and
Zimbabwe, while ODI’s systematic review of cash
transfers found 44 studies, covering 19 countries
and 31 cash transfer programmes. Increasingly,
reviews are looking beyond cash.
UNICEF has been leading the evaluation of
social transfer programmes, including through
its involvement in the Transfer project. Across
countries our work varies, from direct management
of evaluations to technical support and inputs to
evaluations managed by others. Given the wealth
of existing evidence, the need for new impact
evaluations will vary by country, but evidence shows
the policy impact national evaluations can have.
Finally, UNICEF’s evaluation work is increasingly
looking beyond social transfers alone to ‘cash
plus’ initiatives, including links with nutrition and
adolescence programming.

Social protection systems assessments
Finally, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding
overall assessments of national social protection
systems and how they respond to child poverty
and help in realizing universal social protection
for all, starting from those who are not covered
by any programme. Although UNICEF’s social
protection mapping indicates over 80 UNICEF
country offices working on strengthening social
protection systems, our knowledge of where
systems mapping and assessments are being made
remains limited. A major step forward has been
the development of SPIAC-B’s Inter-Agency Social
Protection Assessments (ISPA) tools, including
the development of a Core Diagnostic Instrument
(CODI) to provide an overall assessment of social
protection programmes. CODI has been used by
UNICEF and partners in Belize, Guatemala, Jordan,
Lebanon, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe. While UNICEF
always includes a strong child focused analysis, the
assessments are holistic, reflecting the importance
of the entire social protection system. As well
as CODI, other assessment tools include Social
Protection Public Works Programs, Identification
(ID), and Social Protection Payments.

Country snapshot
Georgia: Child poverty analysis and the national
cash transfer programme
In Georgia, a UNICEF-supported household panel
survey was used to analyse poverty by age
group and demonstrated higher poverty rates
for children. Conversely the analysis revealed
that coverage of the targeted social assistance
programme was lowest for families with children.
Working with the government and the World
Bank throughout this process resulted in the
introduction of a child benefit scheme as part of
the social protection system, reaching around
260,000 in the poorest households in the country.

Guidance to this framework.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Action Area 2 Policy and strategy development, coordination and financing
The overall social protection system determines
both the direction of social protection in a country,
and how well it addresses the needs of children.
However, while policies and strategies are
essential, they will only be effective if they are
adequately financed and if effective coordination
occurs between relevant government ministries
and bodies. UNICEF works with government and
development partners in over 80 countries to
support national governance mechanisms, including
strategies and policy frameworks and coordinating
systems. Work on social protection financing has
also grown significantly.
In this action area UNICEF works with partners on
the following issues:
Social protection strategies and policy
frameworks
Many, but not all, countries have some form of
social protection policy or strategy, which is an
essential foundation of strong and integrated
social protection systems. A mapping of policy
and strategy documents across low- and middleincome countries by the World Bank showed that
108 out of 136 countries either had an active social
protection policy or strategy document in place or
were in the process of planning such a document
in 2014.68 However, determining the child-sensitivity
of these structures is extremely challenging. A
qualitative assessment of UNICEF colleagues
suggests children have received some consideration
in systems development, but only in a very small
minority were they assessed as ‘highly considered’.
Supporting the development of strategies and
policies has long been a core area of work for
UNICEF and partners, working on this area in over
80 countries. Work includes supporting national
dialogues with a range of stakeholders on social
protection, strategy and policy development,
including best practices from other countries, and
developing social protection ‘road maps’ to guide
progress.

National-level coordination of social protection
Coordination of social protection systems is not
easily assessed and there is a limited evidence base
on the extent of effective coordination at national
level. Social protection policies, in place in many
countries, are an important foundation in effective
coordination and UNICEF’s 2015 mapping identified
over 80 countries in which we work on social
protection with a clearly-identified coordinating
ministry. These, however, are only indicative of
the extent and effectiveness of cross-ministerial
coordination on social protection. UNICEF works on
both horizontal coordination (between departments
and ministries) as well as vertical coordination
(centralized and decentralized counterparts,
captured in Action Area 8). Activities include
organizational assessments reviews, capacity
building and development of coordination systems
including MIS.
Domestic financing
Financing for social protection is generally
insufficient for comprehensive child-sensitive social
protection systems. On average, countries spend
only 1.1 per cent of GDP on social protection for
children, although the amounts vary greatly across
countries and regions. As shown in Figure 17, while
Europe and Central Asia, as well as Oceania, spend
more than 2 per cent of GDP on child benefits,
regional estimates for Africa, the Arab States and
Southern and South-East Asia show expenditure
levels of less than 0.7 per cent of GDP. There is an
urgent need to identify ways of increasing the fiscal
space available for social protection, either through
changes to taxation or by reallocating and making
better use of existing social protection spending.
This is particularly important for progressive
realization of social protection for all and expanding
the coverage to those who aren’t included.
Financing for social protection is integral for systems
that effectively reach children, and UNICEF’s work
with partners on public finance, including for social
protection, has grown dramatically. This includes

48

49

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

supporting governments to cost and model the
expansion of social protection programmes, and
to develop fiscally-sustainable financing strategies
based on fiscal space analysis, increasing the
efficiency and effectiveness of existing social
protection spending, reducing fragmentation and
therefore the costs of programmes, and redirecting
spending from less efficient to more efficient forms
of social protection.
UNICEF increasingly recognizes the effects of
both taxation and transfers on children. UNICEF
frequently supports the capacity of line ministries
to manage social protection resources, improve
the efficiency of programme systems such as
payments mechanisms, and measures to improve
the transparency and oversight of social protection
expenditure.

Country snapshot
Tunisia: Micro-simulation to demonstrate
universal child benefit (UCB) cost-efficiency
and impact on poverty
Since 2017, UNICEF has advocated for a
universal child benefit in Tunisia to address the
multidimensional poverty faced by children. A
UCB is currently under consideration as a policy
option by the Government of Tunisia to address a
high child poverty rate of 21.1 per cent compared
to an adult poverty rate of 12.8 per cent. Through
its regional agreement with the International
Policy Center (IPC), UNICEF Tunisia conducted a
micro-simulation to assess the cost and impact
on poverty of a UCB compared to fuel and food
subsidies. Initial analysis by the IPC found that a
UCB would be both more progressive and more
efficient than subsidies.

Guidance to this framework.

Action Area 3 Expanding and improving cash transfers for children
UNICEF support for social transfer programmes,
and cash transfers in particular, is highly developed,
with extensive work underway with partners
ranging from supporting nascent programmes, to
strengthening and consolidating those in place, and
helping develop new universal child benefits. While
there are other social transfers for children, such
as fee abolition and waivers, school feeding and
public works (see Box 13), the majority of our work
has developed around cash transfer programming,
which can have crucial impacts on child outcomes.
While 108 countries have some form of periodic
child/family allowance anchored in national
legislation, only 23 countries (mainly in Europe)
provide any form of non-contributory universal child
or family cash allowance, and a further 14 have
some form of quasi-universal grant, either covering
only a part of childhood, that include some form of
affluence testing, or as part of mixed systems that

combine contributory and non-contributory schemes
(see Figure 18). Legal coverage does not always
mean that benefits are received, and estimates
suggest that two thirds of children (1.3 billion
globally) are not receiving any form of child or family
benefit in this flagship area of social protection.
Further, coverage is lower in parts of the world
such as South Asia and Africa, where child poverty
is higher.69 Cash transfers are also becoming
increasingly important in humanitarian response,
as outlined in Action Area 10. In this action area
UNICEF works with partners on the following
issues:
Building political support
Political support is fundamental to building national
programmes and, as limited coverage and limited
financing in many parts of the world shows, this
is a crucial foundational area of work. Building the
knowledge of decision makers is important as the

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

positive benefits of cash transfer programmes are
particularly vulnerable to misunderstanding and
concerns about misuse (see Box 10 on addressing
the myths around cash transfers). UNICEF works
to build political support for expanded cash transfer
programmes as part of social protection system, to
reach those who aren’t covered by any programme,
particularly children, including engaging in budget
analysis and processes to identify funding for
programmes.
Supporting programme design
Programme design is crucial to whether cash
transfers programmes will make a difference to
children, and the size of their impact. UNICEF
provides technical assistance on the range of
design questions that governments face in
starting, consolidating or expanding a cash transfer
programme. These include considerations of
targeted versus universal approaches and issues
of eligibility and exclusion, determining effective
transfer size, conditionality,70 frequency and
design of implementation mechanisms such as for
grievance and redressal, and gender-responsive
design features. See Action Area 4 for more on
integrating cash transfer recipients with other
services and interventions.
Supporting implementation
UNICEF also works directly with governments
on the implementation of cash transfers,
including programme roll-out, communication
with beneficiaries, registration, payment
and MIS systems, and capacity building of
those implementing the programme. Work on
implementation is echoed in Action Area 8, which
focuses on the administration required to build
coherent and integrated social protection systems.

Country snapshot
Zambia: Engaging in budget frameworks to
expand cash transfers
UNICEF and partners engaged in advocacy for
an increased budget allocation for the Social
Cash Transfer programme in Zambia. Work
included the development of caseload and
budget projections, social sector budget briefs
and extensive engagement with government and
non-government stakeholders. Underpinning this
was an impact evaluation, which built confidence
in the programme. These efforts contributed to
the budget increase for the programme from
US$30.2 million in 2016 to US$55.2 million per
year in 2017. However, significant challenges
remain, including reported irregularities in
the programme that led to the suspension
of support from DFID. The programme is
responding through improved accountability
processes including establishing grievance and
redressal mechanisms to help highlight payment
irregularities.

Guidance to this framework.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Box 13: Beyond cash: Fee abolition and waivers,
public works and school feeding
Although UNICEF’s work on social transfers focuses primarily on national cash transfer programmes, there are a number of
other programme areas relevant to children where UNICEF offices may engage, including fee abolition and waivers, public
works and school feeding.
Public works
Public works programmes have a long history and currently over 100 public work programmes exist in low- and middle-income
countries, and are often considered the flagship social protection programme such as the Productive Safety Net Programme
in Ethiopia and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme in India. The programmes have a dual
objective of providing short-term employment and supporting labour-intensive infrastructure projects. While child well-being is
not the primary objective of public work programmes, they address the income security/coping behaviours of households and
so indirectly can impact child outcomes, although some innovative programmes have introduced linkages with complimentary
services, including for children. Despite their popularity, the evidence base of public work programmes is quite limited, with
some positive impacts documented on consumption smoothing and food security but little systematic evidence on the longterm welfare impacts of recipients. In general, UNICEF tends not to engage directly in public works programmes, although
may provide support on child-related elements including in areas of childcare.
Fee abolition and waivers
Financial barriers to accessing services in crucial areas such as health and education can be hugely impactful on children’s life
chances. While cash transfers can support access, addressing fees at the point of delivery through fee abolition or fee waivers
can be a crucial social protection intervention for poor and vulnerable children, particularly girls who often have higher dropout
rates. Education has been through a wave of fee abolition and the Education 2030 agenda commits to providing inclusive
and equitable education at all levels and provide lifelong learning, committing to giving every child 12 years of free education.
The push to achieve universal health coverage for essential services is also seeing countries introduce essential services free
at the point of delivery. Challenges in both areas remain, including issues of service quality as usage expands rapidly, often
beyond financing and remaining out of pocket expenses such as travel costs and other school fees such as for uniforms. While
health and education have received the most attention, user fees can also negatively affect children and families in poverty
in areas ranging from early childhood development to access to water. Globally, UNICEF works at the country level towards
achieving universal coverage including addressing fees and maintaining service quality, with work generally led by sectors
rather than through social protection.
School feeding
An estimated 368 million children – about one in five – receive at least one meal at school daily. The large amounts of
investment made by countries on school feeding programmes often from government budgets reflect the near universal
recognition of its importance and political appeal. As a social protection instrument, school feeding programmes can be
considered as explicit or implicit transfers to households of the value of the food transferred. There are two types: (i) in school
feeding and (ii) take home rations. In most countries they are considered a social protection measure and as instruments
that promote human capital in the long run by supporting families in securing education for their children. Evidence shows
that these programmes mainly have the ability to improve education outcomes for children, with a systematic review of 216
education programmes in 52 low- and middle-income countries finding that school feeding programmes are one of the few
education interventions that show positive impact in both school participation and learning. Recent trends in school feeding
programmes show an increasing effort by policymakers in designing synergies with additional inputs to elicit nutritional
impacts as well as an effort to use locally-produced foods. Traditionally, UNICEF hasn’t engaged extensively on school feeding
programmes which are often led by the World Food Programme, but areas of support and engagement are being considered in
our forthcoming Education Strategy.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Action Area 4 Connecting cash transfers to information, knowledge
and services

Although cash transfers can have huge impacts
on children’s lives, not all barriers families face are
financial. Where families are unable to access quality
services – for example, due to a lack of information
or lack of knowledge on good practices in areas such
as nutrition or sanitation – cash transfers alone may
not be impactful. This is underlined empirically by
the evidence that cash alone is not always sufficient
to improve child outcomes. While UNICEF works
extensively on cash transfers, work on connecting cash
transfer programming with appropriate information and
knowledge (often referred to as ‘cash plus’ which is
part of an integrated social protection system)71 is at
an earlier stage of development, but can be a crucial
step towards integrated programming, particularly
in contexts where cash transfers are a leading social
protection programme. Given UNICEF's specialized
knowledge and engagement across multiple sectors
as well as extensive experience on communication
for development, UNICEF is well-placed to work with
partners to support these linkages, with a strong focus
now emerging around nutrition.72
This is an emerging area for UNICEF, with work with
partners focusing on the following issues:

Country snapshot
Tanzania: ‘Cash plus’ (integrated social
protection) model on adolescent transitions
Adolescents in Tanzania face many risks related to
poverty, early pregnancy and marriage, violence, HIV,
and lack of livelihood opportunities. UNICEF worked
with the Government of Tanzania to complement
the national Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN)
programme with a ‘cash plus’ model: a ten-week
course, including livelihood skills and business
concepts and planning. Following the training,
adolescents have access to mentoring and coaching,
access to vocational training and opportunities to
apply for a productive grant. The baseline report has
been finalized, with evaluation of initial data expected
later in 2018.
For a fuller case study, please see the Companion Guidance
to this framework.

Providing information and knowledge to
beneficiaries and connections to services:
UNICEF works to build linkages between cash
programmes by connecting recipients to information
programmes and services. In East and Southern
Africa, for example, programmes are adopting inclusive
approaches ranging from nutrition counselling for
cash beneficiaries and linking community ‘influencers’
to referral and case management. And in Ghana,
cash transfer recipients are enrolled without fees in
the national health insurance programme. Given the
emerging area of this work, UNICEF also works actively
to test and document ‘cash plus’ approaches through
our work on impact evaluations to build knowledge on
best practices in policy and programming.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Action Area 5 Expanding and improving health insurance
Social insurance includes contributory programmes
such as those covering risks from sickness, old
age and unemployment, all of which have very
significant implications for children. For UNICEF,
the main area of contribution to social insurance
programmes is around health insurance.73 While
UNICEF’s work in the area is limited, a review of
UNICEF’s work revealed significant examples,
including work in the Philippines on insurance
packages for children including premature newborns
and children with disabilities.74 Further, there has
been a growing interest from partner governments
on the potential of health insurance to support
universal health coverage.
Although there is limited analysis on the coverage
of health insurance for children, as well programme
costs and the appropriateness of benefits, evidence
does suggest that overall coverage of health
insurance is limited in many areas. Health insurance
coverage differs greatly across the globe; while
almost 100 per cent of the population in Western
Europe are covered, coverage amounts to only 37
per cent in Asia and the Pacific (excluding China)
and 25 per cent in Africa.75 A review of evidence
finds that social health insurance does generally
increase access to and use of services, but this may
not always include the poorest or most vulnerable in
society.76
This is an emerging area for UNICEF, with work with
partners focusing on the following issues:
Expanding coverage with a focus on vulnerable
populations and those living in poverty
With health insurance emerging as a mechanism
to increase coverage, including in lower-income
countries, ensuring that the most vulnerable are
eligible and receiving services is crucial. One of
the emerging areas of UNICEF’s work is increasing
coverage by linking recipients of social protection
programmes to health insurance, and addressing
issues of exclusion in health insurance programmes.

Supporting governments to define the package
of health services under universal health
coverage
Universal health coverage includes a minimum
package of healthcare services that should be
provided free of charge. UNICEF is ideally placed to
provide support and advise on the definition of the
package of health services for children and mothers.
As a new area of work, the direction of support is
likely to evolve over time.

Country snapshot
Mali: Expansion of non-contributory health
insurance for poor households
The Government of Mali runs a national
non-contributory health insurance scheme,
the Régime d’Assistance Médicale (RAMED).
Eligibility for the programme is granted for
three years to people who are considered
the poorest and who have no one to assist
them. In 2018, the number of beneficiaries
in the UNICEF-supported regions of Mopti
and Sikasso who received medical services
through RAMED increased sharply to 49,217
compared to only 5,287 in 2015, including
15,289 children in the two regions in the
last year. UNICEF also collaborated with
the World Bank in 2018 to refer the poorest
beneficiaries of Jigisemejiri (the Emergency
Safety Nets programme funded by the World
Bank) to the RAMED programme, so that
they can benefit from an integrated social
protection package.

Guidance to this framework.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Action Area 6 Supporting childcare and adolescent employability
While labour market interventions form a core
aspect of social protection for many organizations,
they have not typically been part of UNICEF
social protection work. However, UNICEF’s new
Strategic Plan reflects significant organizational
commitment to two areas with direct implications
for the employment of vulnerable populations:
(i) supporting quality accessible childcare which
facilitates parental (often maternal) employment
and benefits early childhood development; and (ii)
employability skills-building for adolescents as they
transition to adulthood. These are newer areas of
UNICEF’s work in supporting social protection, and
notably are not generally led by social policy teams
who lead the majority of UNICEF’s work on social
protection.
This is an emerging area for UNICEF, and includes
work with partners focusing on the following issues:
Childcare
UNICEF is working on expanding quality and
affordable care for young children in 51 countries
worldwide, and in these countries it is estimated
that more than 50 per cent of children had access
to quality affordable care. UNICEF’s work on
childcare includes developing national frameworks
that include a focus on convenient, affordable
and quality care, including a focus on issues such
appropriate curriculum, facilities and quality teaching
and appropriate ratios. We also support familyfriendly workplaces. As financial barriers are often
a common impediment to accessing childcare,
there are close connections between our work on
childcare and other aspects of social protection.
Adolescent learning and skills for employability
All children and adolescents should be able to
complete primary and secondary education,
gaining the learning and skills needed for life and
work. But less than half of adolescents globally
complete secondary school, with the poorest most
excluded. Moreover, youth are three times as likely

as adults to be unemployed. A total of 22 per cent
of young people aged 15–29 are not in employment,
education or training (NEET), with a much higher
female rate (36 per cent) than male (9 per cent).
UNICEF will continue to develop the learning and
skills of children and adolescents (aged 3–15 years)
with a focus on foundational and transferrable skills,
whilst also supporting older adolescents to gain
skills needed as they reach adulthood. Strategies
include promoting equity in access to skills
development opportunities, developing adolescent
skills for work via multiple pathways and modalities,
strengthening the quality and relevance of skills
provision, and connecting adolescents to productive
work opportunities.

Country snapshot
Bangladesh: Quality informal
apprenticeships for vulnerable out-ofschool adolescents
Over four years, 18,900 out-of-school
adolescent boys and girls in Bangladesh
accessed informal apprenticeships.
Apprenticeships were provided to include
supervised training under a selected master
craftsperson using a competency-based
training and assessment model, including
on-the-job trade training, and off-thejob trade theory and soft skills classes.
Adolescents were placed in trades that
challenged gender stereotypes and those
who completed the apprenticeship were
supported with job placements. More than
95 per cent of learners (50 per cent girls)
graduated and became wage-earners.

Guidance to this framework.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Action Area 7 Strengthening the social welfare workforce and direct
outreach to families

Families that are economically and socially vulnerable
often face a range of challenges beyond the level of
family income. Support to improve child outcomes
requires direct outreach to assess the challenges
they may face and provide the required responses,
ranging from psychosocial support to connections
to needed services. Such referral services and case
management are often linked to the social welfare
workforce but may also be implemented by or in
collaboration with community-based volunteers and
paraprofessionals.
A review of evidence shows there is significant room
for both expanding and strengthening the social
welfare workforce as well as building connections
with social protection programmes. In Eastern and
Southern Africa, for example, a review highlighted
the importance of strong case management and
referral mechanisms for addressing the needs of
vulnerable children, with the expansion of social
cash transfer programmes in the region offering
opportunities for establishing such mechanisms.77 In
Asia and the Pacific, case management is deemed
important in supporting families as they transition out
of cash transfer programmes.78
Although social welfare systems are well developed
in some parts of the world, such as Europe and
Central Asia and OECD countries, in others they are
much more nascent. Across parts of Africa and Asia,
ratios can be as low as one government social worker
for tens of thousands of people. This raw count itself
can be misleading as non-governmental agencies can
provide social work services and in many countries
community level systems are in place, but often
functioning on a volunteer basis. On the other hand,
numbers alone can obscure other challenges such
as issues of work load, appropriate qualifications,
training and support to handle the range of issues
which can be required when working with families.
Further, links between social protection programmes
and outreach services are often not in place.
Given UNICEF’s experience in both social protection
and child protection, we are uniquely placed to
work with governments and other partners in
strengthening systems to provide this outreach. In

this action area UNICEF works with partners on the
following issues:
Building and strengthening the social welfare
workforce
The social welfare workforce is the foundation of
providing direct personal support to families facing a
range of needs. UNICEF’s work includes functional
reviews of the social work system, including
assessing gaps in capacity and numbers; national
approaches to expanding the workforce, including
roles and responsibilities; and providing increased
training and support to facilitate social work, including
the use of new technologies.
Family outreach and case management
The expansion of cash transfer programmes and a
strengthened social welfare workforce provides an
opportunity to build case management approaches
to identify and follow up on the range of needs a
family may have. This includes adjusting information
systems with relevant indicators, mapping child
specific services and referral, and supporting
the development and implementation of a case
management system.

Country snapshot
The State of Palestine: a case-management
approach to multidimensional poverty
The State of Palestine’s national framework
on poverty incorporates both the economic
and social dimensions of vulnerabilities. In
2016–2017, UNICEF and the WFP supported
the Ministry of Social Development to design
a new six-year Social Development Sector
Strategy that incorporates the national
guidelines. Consequently, the central focus of
ministry reform was the introduction of a case
management system – an approach advocated by
UNICEF. Under this system, families classified as
extremely poor are assigned a social worker who
then conducts home visits to assess each client
family’s needs and establish a customized plan of
care and support services.

Guidance to this framework.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Action Area 8 Strengthening integrated administrative systems
A strong administrative system is the backbone of
an integrated social protection system. It enables
coordination among different programmes and
improves efficiency by simplifying processes,
effort, time and resources. Different countries are
at various stages of putting in place integrated
administrative systems, but generally there is
significant room for growth in this area. This is
an established area of work for UNICEF and
partners, although typically UNICEF focuses on
administration of particular programmes. There are
different components of a systems administration
as discussed under the elements of child-sensitive
social protection (CSSP). UNICEF’s strong
comparative advantage is ensuring that childsensitive information is sufficiently and adequately
collected, analyzed and reported, and that systems
are disability- and gender-sensitive and shock
responsive.
In this action area, UNICEF’s work with partners
includes:
Improving integrated information systems
Integrated data on social protection, including
information on children, not only enables better
programme monitoring but also provides
information that policy makers can use to make
decisions for planning, design and implementation.
While many countries have programme MIS
and associated beneficiary registries, integrated
information systems that serve the sector as a
whole are still lacking, particularly with gaps on
child-specific information and crucial characteristics
such as gender and disability. UNICEF has been
engaged in supporting governments in establishing
MIS for specific cash transfer programmes in many
countries, and demand is increasing for support on
integrated information systems and the registries
that underpin them.

Improving coordination and service delivery at
sub-national level
In general, human resource functions for social
protection are underfunded and under-staffed,
particularly in rural areas where child poverty rates
tend to be higher. UNICEF is very active at local
level not only in social protection, but in education,
health, nutrition and child protection, making it
well placed to support sub-national coordination
and service delivery among different child-related
departments. This includes building the capacity of
the social workforce at local level, and increasing
planning, monitoring and overall management and
service delivery of social protection system.

Country snapshot
Iraq: Developing a Management Information
System (MIS) to identify, monitor and followup beneficiaries as part of a government cash
transfer programme
With support from UNICEF, in collaboration with
the World Bank and the Ministry of Labour and
Social Affairs (MOLSA), the Government of Iraq are
piloting a case identification and referral approach as
part of a pilot cash transfer programme to improve
school enrolment and retention, and improve health
outcomes for children and women by increasing
the number of prenatal and postnatal visits and
vaccination for children under the age of 5. The
pilot programme was launched by the Minister of
MOLSA in March 2018 in Sadr-2 in the Baghdad
Governorate of Iraq. The MIS provides beneficiaries,
social workers, schools management staff and health
centre officials with a user-friendly platform to follow
up and identify cases that need additional support.

Action Area 9 Strengthening national shock-responsive social
protection systems

Children and families need social protection
systems to respond to shocks at the individual,
household or community level, but also to respond
when broader crises, including humanitarian crises,
hit. A mapping exercise conducted by UNICEF
revealed significant gaps in the ability of flagship
cash transfer programmes to be scaled up by
governments in response to a crisis. While the
ability of social protection systems to play a role in
a crisis varies across countries, there is tremendous
scope to improve the speed of response and
coverage of vulnerable populations and their needs
by focusing on preparedness and strengthening
different components of routine social protection
systems, including increased coordination with
the Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and
humanitarian sectors. With extensive experience in
social protection as well as humanitarian response,
UNICEF is extremely well placed to support
governments and other partners in this rapidlyexpanding area. Strengthening shock-responsive
social protection systems is integral to all of the
action areas outlined above, but with specific focus
and activities:
Evidence and analysis
Routine areas of UNICEF expertise – such
as conducting child poverty analysis, impact
evaluations, monitoring and evaluation (M&E),
costing exercises and system assessments – can
better encompass a focus on risks and shocks, to
feed into planning and programming.
Policy, strategy, legislation, coordination and
financing
UNICEF works on adapting national policies,
strategies and legislation to allow for the use of
routine programmes and their underlying systems
to support a comprehensive national response
strategy, in coordination with the DRM and
humanitarian sectors. This is complemented by
work to ensure a financing strategy, clear roles
and responsibilities and lines of accountability for
eventual scale up.

Programmes and their design features
UNICEF works alongside governments to ensure
that the mix of interventions – including linkages,
objectives, targeting design, transfer value, timing
and duration – respond to the needs of populations
who are at risk of, or affected by, (covariate) shocks.
Administration and delivery systems
UNICEF supports preparedness measures so that
programmes, and their underlying delivery systems,
are ready to a) ensure continuity of service delivery
and b) potentially flex or scale up in response to
shocks. For an existing system to play a role in
times of crisis, the ‘nuts and bolts’ of that system
require minor adjustments so that they can respond
to different objectives and timelines, aligned with
changes in social protection policy and strategy.

Country snapshot
Malawi: Establishing a shock-responsive
social protection system
Malawi is an agriculture-based economy that
is exposed to climate and weather-related
risks, and faces seasonal dry spells that have
progressively eroded the livelihood systems of
poor households. More than 50 per cent of the
population lives below the national poverty line.
UNICEF is working closely with the Ministry
of Gender, Child, Disability and Social Welfare,
the WFP and other stakeholders to: (i) support
investment in shock-sensitive social protection;
(ii) pilot vertical and horizontal expansion of the
flagship Social Cash Transfer Programme; (iii)
increase efficiency of payment systems; and (iv)
build national capacity to support scale up.

Guidance to this framework.

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Box 14: UNICEF’s approach to social protection in fragile,
humanitarian and other crisis contexts
Social protection systems should be able to respond to crises, in addition to addressing longer-term poverty and social
vulnerability. Children and families need support not only to counter obstacles affecting individual households, but also to
respond to shocks that affect large parts of the population simultaneously. These shocks can include protracted, slow and
sudden onset humanitarian crises, as well as economic crises. The response to these shocks should also take into account
the differentiated experience of individuals within the population affected, depending on different and often intersecting
vulnerabilities.
Government social protection systems can be highly effective mechanisms for emergency response. Effective social
protection systems already have measures in place to identify and reach the vulnerable as well as consultation and monitoring
mechanisms to ensure that systems are working effectively; all of which are essential for supporting people in times of crisis.
This is recognized in the international consensus that humanitarian response should, wherever feasible, take place through
national systems, including social protection systems, reflecting the responsibility of the State in times of emergency as well
as development contexts.
In order to become shock responsive, national social protection systems often need some design changes. These
changes range from policy, financing and coordination mechanisms to developing shock-responsive operating mechanisms
(such as adjusting the MIS/database, strengthening delivery mechanisms, and using technology to improve speed and
transparency).
UNICEF has a strong comparative advantage in supporting the development and use of shock-responsive social
protection systems. UNICEF already works extensively on supporting governments to strengthen national social protection
systems, and we are present before, during and after a crisis working across development, fragile and humanitarian contexts.
Key results outlined in UNICEF’s Strategic Plan 2017-2021 reflect our commitment to extend our social protection support to
helping governments strengthen these systems to be shock-responsive.
UNICEF’s approach to this work focuses first on supporting social protection system preparedness. With the growing
recognition of the role of cash in humanitarian response, this may involve a particular focus on the readiness of national social
assistance programmes and how they link to national emergency response processes. However, this can and should include
links to other important services, including case management services for vulnerable children and families, and connections to
key services such as health and education. (This work is captured in Action Area 9: Building and strengthening national shockresponsive social protection systems.)
UNICEF also supports the use of national social protection systems during a crisis. Where government systems are not
strong enough to be used in their entirety, UNICEF will support governments to use some aspects of the system (such as
beneficiary and social registries or payment mechanisms), and work to ensure any parallel mechanisms are as closely aligned
with government systems as possible. In some contexts, government systems may not be in place or appropriate to use and
alternative delivery mechanisms may be needed. Where such non-government mechanisms are used, UNICEF will support
building nascent national social protection systems for longer-term use and help strengthen the humanitarian-development
continuum. (This work is captured in Action Area 10: Linking humanitarian cash transfers to social protection systems.)
For more information, see the Outcome Document from the International Conference on Social Protection in contexts of Fragility and Forced
Displacement (2017).

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Action Area 10 Linking humanitarian cash transfers to social
protection systems

The global community is increasingly focusing on
the need to channel humanitarian response in the
form of cash transfers wherever appropriate. The
past decade has seen a significant increase in the
use of cash transfers to assist populations affected
by crisis with an estimated US$2.8 billion disbursed
worldwide as humanitarian cash transfers in 2016,79
up by 40 per cent from 2015 and approximately
100 per cent from 2014. Despite the increase,
humanitarian cash transfers (HCTs) comprised 10
per cent of the overall humanitarian aid.
As an agency with extensive experience in social
transfers, and presence in countries before during
and after crises hit, UNICEF is extremely well placed
to support the delivery of cash during humanitarian
response, including linking children and families to
services and information. Wherever possible, our
focus is to support the use of national systems in
whole or in part for humanitarian cash transfers,
and to integrate a focus on systems building into
our work so that national social protection systems
emerge strengthened.
In this action area UNICEF works with partners on
the following issues:
Designing humanitarian cash transfers to
achieve sectoral outcomes
Design elements include context analysis and
assessments of children’s needs, designing the
transfer including any targeting approaches,
transfer values and timing, and coordination with
stakeholders.
Supporting identifying the role of national
systems in implementation of a humanitarian
cash transfer programme
UNICEF’s first choice is to use national systems
for delivery, and includes assessing system
compatibility with humanitarian principles, capacity
to deliver, and designing the best delivery approach
with relevant partners.

Using the national social protection system to
implement a humanitarian cash transfer
UNICEF’s first choice is delivery of HCTs through
the national system, however, where needed
we also implement delivery through parallel or
mixed systems. Where parallel systems are used,
UNICEF works to build linkages to support national
programmes in the future.

Country snapshot
Dominica: Delivering a multi-purpose
child grant through the Public Assistance
Programme
Following Hurricane Maria in Dominica in 2017,
UNICEF partnered with the Government and
WFP to design a humanitarian cash transfer
programme to respond to the needs of affected
households with children. It was decided to
leverage the existing national Public Assistance
Programme (PAP) system for the transfer.
The programme provided unconditional cash
transfers to almost 25,000 people (including
6,000 children) by scaling up the national
programme both in terms of households
reached and transfer amounts. UNICEF’s
contribution included financial and technical
support, programme communication support
and payment monitoring.

World Vision

Social protection refers to a
range of formal and informal
mechanisms that support
the basic needs of the most
vulnerable households by
smoothing consumption,
providing safety nets, and
promoting positive coping
strategies in the event of a
crisis.

• Social protection include
government and NGOprovided mechanisms such as
health centres, nutritious food
for children, food distribution
programmes, and cash-based
interventions.
• Other less formal types of
social protection include
support from religious
institutions such as church or
community groups or help
from family members or
neighbours.

Annex 3

Glossary
This glossary hopes to provide clarity and, where possible,
definitions for selected terms used throughout this
document, noting that these terms can be interpreted
differently by different agencies and stakeholders. References
for terms are provided wherever possible.
Active labour market policies: Active labour market policies
aim to reduce unemployment by: (i) matching jobseekers with
current vacancies; (ii) upgrading and adapting jobseekers’
skills; (iii) providing employment subsidies; and (iv) creating
jobs either through public sector employment or the provision
of subsidies for private sector work. They can be contrasted
with passive labour market policies (PLMPs) which intends to
provide replacement income during times of joblessness.81
Cash plus: ‘Cash plus’ programmes can be characterized as
social protection interventions that provide regular transfers
in combination with additional components or linkages
that seek to augment income effects. This is done either
by inducing further behavioural changes or by addressing
supply-side constraints. Options for so doing include the
provision of information (such as through behaviour-change
communication or sensitization meetings), provision of
additional benefits and support (such as supplementary
feeding or psychosocial support), provision or facilitation
of access to services (such as through health insurance
or setting up village savings and loans associations) or
implementation of case management (ensuring referrals
to other sectors), or strengthening the quality of existing
services and facilitating linkages to these.82 It is important
to note that although the term ‘cash plus’ implies a social
protection system with cash at its centre, in many countries
and regions this is not how social protection systems are
structured, so the term may not be useful in all contexts.
Cash transfers: Non-contributory scheme or programme
providing cash benefits to individuals or households, usually
financed out of taxation, other government revenue, or
external grants or loans. Cash transfer programmes may or
may not include a means test. Cash transfer programmes
that provide cash to families subject to the condition that
they fulfil specific behavioural requirements are referred to as
conditional cash transfer programmes (CCTs). This may mean,
for example, that beneficiaries must ensure their children
attend school regularly, or that they utilize basic preventative
nutrition and healthcare services.
Child-sensitive social protection (CSSP): CSSP
encompasses programmes that aim to maximise positive

impacts on children and to minimise potential unintended
side effects. This includes both direct interventions (i.e. child
focused or targeted) and indirect interventions. CSSP can
be implemented in both humanitarian and development
contexts, and across sectoral areas, to advance the rights
and well-being of children, especially the poorest and most
deprived. In that regard, it is important that CSSP not
only focuses on children living with their families, but also
recognises and addresses the needs of children living outside
of households, such as children without parental care.83
Child protection: UNICEF uses the term ‘child protection’
to refer to prevention and response to violence, exploitation
and abuse of children in all contexts. This includes reaching
children who are especially vulnerable to these threats,
such as those living without family care, on the streets or in
situations of conflict or natural disasters.84
Exclusion errors: The inadvertent exclusion of intended
beneficiaries from a programme recipient pool as the result of
a particular targeting practice.
Inclusion errors: The inadvertent inclusion of unintended
beneficiaries in a programme recipient pool as the result of a
particular targeting practice.
In-kind transfers: Predictable and regular transfers of food,
fuel or other basic goods which are used to reduce the
vulnerability of individuals or households.85
Monetary poverty: Monetary poverty is most commonly
defined as insufficient income to buy a minimum basket of
goods and services.86 Each country has its own threshold,
which varies depending on country status. In high-income
countries, poverty lines are often relative, i.e. defined in
relation to the overall distribution of income. In low-income
countries, poverty lines are often set by absolute standards,
following the cost of basic needs method.87
The international extreme poverty line is defined at PPP$1.90
per day per person and is set with reference to the national
poverty lines in a select number of the poorest countries,
and must therefore be understood to represent a very low
threshold standard of living. More recently the World Bank
has used the PPP$3.20 and PPP$5.50 international poverty
lines, in particularly for middle-income countries. The World
Bank databases have an overview of poverty rates at national
poverty lines as well as poverty rates at various international
poverty lines.88

UNICEF’S SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAMME FRAMEWORK 2019

Multidimensional poverty:89 Multidimensional poverty
encompasses the multiple deprivations experienced by
people in their daily lives – such as poor access to health,
inadequate education, poor nutrition, inadequate living
standards, among others.
Multidimensional poverty is particularly relevant for children,
as they experience poverty differently and more severely
than adults, damaging their mental, physical, emotional and
spiritual development. For children, living in poverty means
being deprived in the immediate aspects of their lives, areas
including nutrition, health, water, education, protection and
shelter. Therefore, expanding the definition of child poverty
beyond traditional conceptualizations, such as low household
income or low levels of consumption, is important.
Public works: A transfer (usually cash or food) that is given
on completion of a work requirement generally to increase
workers’ income. Public works are often for a short duration
and produce a public good in the form of new infrastructure
or improvements of existing infrastructure or delivery of
services.
Shock-responsive social protection: The ability of the
social protection system to anticipate shocks to maintain its
regular programme/s, to scale up and/or flex to accommodate
new populations and needs as a result of the shocks, and to
contribute to resilience building of individuals, households,
communities and systems against future shocks. The term
`scale up’ refers to a range of options including but not limited
to introduction of new governmental programmes; expansion
of existing programmes; and use of some or all components
of the programme operational system by other ministries
(especially DRM) and/or other humanitarian actors such as
UNICEF to deliver humanitarian assistance.
Social exclusion: A state in which individuals are unable to
participate fully in economic, social, political and cultural life,
as well as the process leading to and sustaining such a state.
Participation may be hindered when people lack access to
material resources, including income, employment, land and
housing, or to such services as education and healthcare —
essential foundations of well-being. Yet participation is also
limited when people cannot exercise their voice or interact
with each other, and when their rights and dignity are not
accorded equal respect and protection. Thus, social exclusion
entails not only material deprivation but also lack of agency
or control over important decisions as well as feelings of
alienation and inferiority. In nearly all countries, to varying
degrees, age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, migration
status, socioeconomic status, place of residence, and sexual
orientation and gender identity have been grounds for social
exclusion over time.

Social insurance: Refers to programmes such as health
insurance, unemployment insurance and contributory
pensions. This type of social protection relies on regular
monetary contributions from citizens in order to help
guarantee the income security of individuals and households
as well as their access to essential social services.90
Social pensions: Regular and predictable non-contributory
payments made out to the elderly or to people with
disabilities.
Social protection: A set of policies and programmes
aimed at preventing or protecting all people against poverty,
vulnerability and social exclusion throughout their life-course,
with particular emphasis on vulnerable groups.91
Social protection floor: A nationally-defined set of basic
social security guarantees comprising of: (a) access to
essential healthcare, including maternity care; (b) basic
income security for children; (c) basic income security for
persons in active age who are unable to earn sufficient
income, in particular in cases of sickness, unemployment,
maternity and disability; and (d) basic income security for
older persons.92
Social transfers: Predictable direct transfers to individuals
or households, both in-kind and cash (including cash for
work and public work programmes) to protect and prevent
individuals and households from being affected by shock and
support the accumulation of human, productive and financial
assets.
Vulnerability: Vulnerability captures the factors that make
people likely to become poor or fall deeper into poverty over
time. Vulnerability considers both an individual’s current
capabilities and the external factors that they face, and
how likely it is that this combination will lead to changes in
their status. Vulnerability captures the interaction between:
(i) exposure of individuals and households to risk, i.e. the
chances or threat of an adverse event or hazard; and (ii) their
capacity to respond and cope, i.e. susceptibility or exposure
to this event due to level of resources (physical, economic,
social, political, etc.).

•

•

Social vulnerabilities – The cultural, gendered,
ethnic and other structural social factors that make
individuals both more exposed and susceptible to
risk.
Economic vulnerabilities – The wealth and incomerelated factors that make individuals more exposed
and susceptible to risk.

countries from the 25th to the 75th percentile
on the World Bank’s Human Capital Index
(HCI). The HCI measures the amount of human
capital that a child born today can expect to
attain by the age of 18. It is constructed for
157 countries and conveys the productivity of
the next generation of workers compared to
a benchmark of complete education and full
health. It is made up of five indicators: (1) the
probability of survival to age five; (2) a child’s
expected years of schooling; (3) harmonized
test scores as a measure of quality of learning;
(4) adult survival rate (fraction of 15-yearolds that will survive to age 60); and (5) the
proportion of children who are not stunted. See

right to social protection is Article 9 of the
ICESCR, which has been clarified by General
Comment 19 on the right to social security, and
complemented by ILO Recommendation 202.
During the drafting process of the ICESCR,
there is evidence of the drafters’ intention
for ILO standards to operate as the special
law (lex specialis) in respect of the content
of the right to social security enshrined in
Article 9. See also Saul, Ben, David Kinley and

Document Summary

UNICEF’s new Global Social Protection Programme Framework outlines the role
that child-sensitive social protection systems play in addressing child poverty
and vulnerability. It provides UNICEF’s conceptual approach to social protection,
evidence of its impacts, and clarity on what constitutes a child sensitive social
protection system. The framework also lays out UNICEF’s ten action areas on
social protection, through which UNICEF, together with partners, works with
governments to progressively achieve universal social protection for children.
