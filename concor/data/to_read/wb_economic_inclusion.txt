Foreword

T

he State of Economic Inclusion Report 2021: The Potential to Scale gives voice
to one of the most stubborn challenges in development—transforming the
economic lives of the extreme poor and vulnerable. At the time of writing, this
challenge is being magnified by the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic
affects the poor and vulnerable most strongly, with early evidence suggesting disproportionate gender impacts. Economic inclusion programs face the dual challenge of
adapting delivery norms during a pandemic and ensuring readiness to respond as part
of the medium- and long-term recovery efforts.
Against a backdrop of much uncertainty, this report provides some hope. A central
hypothesis of the report is that people who are poor and vulnerable face multiple
constraints when encountering “poverty traps” for which a multidimensional response
is required. Economic inclusion programs now under way in over 75 countries
demonstrate that this hypothesis and response show signs of success. Defined here
as a bundle of coordinated multidimensional interventions that support individuals,
households, and communities in increasing incomes and assets, economic inclusion
programs show flexibility in a variety of settings. One area with transformative potential
is women’s economic empowerment. There is now a considerable body of operational
work focused on explicit gender-intentional program design to promote empowerment
and mitigate unintended household and community risks.
The global landscape for economic inclusion has shifted significantly in recent
years. A surge in global operations is driven by the scale-up of government-led
programs that build on social protection, livelihoods and jobs, and financial inclusion
investments. Continued momentum draws on a wealth of innovation and learning,
spanning several technical experiences and domains, including graduation, social safety
nets “plus,” and community-driven programs as well as local economic development
initiatives. A major contribution of this report is to present—for the first time—a
systematic review of both government and nongovernment efforts. Evidence gathered
in the report provides a unique baseline to benchmark the current global landscape and
will enable us to track how it evolves in coming years.
All of this brings to the fore a central question: What is the potential for these
multidimensional programs to scale up? The true potential of economic inclusion
programs will be unlocked through the scale that is achieved through adoption by
government actors. Many countries are at a nascent stage of this journey and wrestling
with questions of program feasibility and sustainability. For this reason, the report
focuses squarely on the political realities surrounding program scale-up and the
manifold trade-offs that governments face in moving this agenda forward. The report
highlights opportunities for improved program delivery and fiscal and policy coherence
with stronger leadership and collaboration. Of course, successful government-led
interventions also require strong partnership at the local level, with community
organizations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector.
The State of Economic Inclusion Report 2021 emphasizes the possibility of leveraging
social protection systems and the cross-sectoral collaboration that this involves. Recent
years have seen a strong increase in financing and coverage of social protection programs
across the world, with a demonstrated set of impacts reflecting how cash transfers, in
particular, can boost the equity and resilience of the poorest. As countries expand the
coverage and financing of this form of social protection, the terms safety nets–plus and
xi

cash-plus are gaining prominence, the “plus” indicating the potential to complement
cash with additional inputs and service components or link to other sectors (agriculture,
environment, financial services, and so forth). Economic inclusion is a key driver of the
social safety nets–plus agenda, demonstrating particular promise to strengthen program
impacts, but also bringing with it the reality of increased costs and complexity.
For this reason, the report moves forward key debates on program impact and
costs, which are central to the sustainability of economic inclusion programs at scale.
The report identifies a promising and potentially sustained set of impacts across a wide
range of outcomes. A multicountry costing analysis helps to clarify the major cost drivers and cost ranges in different programs. Notably, the discussion brings into focus
the need to rebalance debates on impacts and costs to reflect a shift from stand-alone
nonprofit-led projects to government-led programs. This will have important operational implications for identifying cost-effective interventions and for cost optimization.
Continued learning and evidence generation will be especially important as programs
adapt to changing poverty contexts and megatrends, such as fragility, shocks (including
climate change), urbanization, digitization, and demography.
As a flagship publication under the Partnership for Economic Inclusion (PEI), the
report places a welcome emphasis on joint learning and collaboration. PEI is a dedicated platform to support the adoption and adaptation of national economic inclusion
programs working with a variety of stakeholders, including national governments and
bilateral, multilateral, NGO, research, and private-sector organizations. The partnership
network is critical for contributing to evidence-based good practice, crowding in expertise, and providing a platform to refine and share cutting-edge knowledge on economic
inclusion, with a strong emphasis on women’s economic inclusion. As an example
of this joint learning, the report is launched with an online and open-access PEI Data
Portal (www.peiglobal.org), which will facilitate cross-learning and help track the
development of the global landscape in years to come.
To this end, we welcome The State of Economic Inclusion Report 2021 as an
important milestone for continued learning in the common mission to support the
scale-up of cost-effective and sustainable economic inclusion programs for the poorest
in the years to come.
We look forward to continued and successful collaboration.

Executive Summary

I

n recent years there has been growing global momentum to strengthen and scale
up economic inclusion for the poorest. Key actions are being taken in light of the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—to “end poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030” and to address inclusive and sustainable growth (SDG 8). The State
of Economic Inclusion Report 2021: The Potential to Scale brings to light a shifting
global landscape, as reflected through the experiences of the 75 countries featured in
the review. The momentum for this shift is driven by the scale-up of government-led
programs that build on social protection, livelihoods and jobs, and financial inclusion
investments. This shift is also fueled by a promising evidence base and a groundswell
of learning, originating especially from graduation programs within the nonprofit sector.
Efforts to scale up respond to high levels of extreme poverty and most recently
the fallout of COVID-19. By 2030, following a business-as-usual scenario, an estimated 479 million people are projected to be living in extreme poverty, and the share
of global poor living in fragile and conflict-affected countries is expected to reach
50 percent by 2030.1 In the final months of 2020, the fallout from the coronavirus
pandemic raises the possibility of more than 80 million people being pushed into
extreme poverty. Emerging experiences show the potential of economic inclusion
programs—as part of integrated policy responses—to mitigate the economywide and
sector-specific downturns created by this pandemic and ultimately to facilitate the
restoration of livelihoods and the recovery of communities.

Great Expectations and Some Skepticism
As economic inclusion programs for the poorest evolve, a story of great expectations and
considerable skepticism emerges. A sustainable and inclusive economy that “leaves no
one behind” is more important than ever. While transformative economic growth will
be the ultimate driver of poverty reduction, it is not automatically inclusive and does
not always penetrate the poorest households. In strengthening economic inclusion for
the poorest, it is important to recognize “poverty traps” and to realize that unleashing the productive potential of people living in poverty involves the removal of multiple
constraints through a multidimensional response. In practice, household, community,
local economy, and institutional constraints may impact specific population cohorts
most strongly, such as women, youths, people with disabilities, and those who have
been displaced. As a cross-cutting priority, economic inclusion programs tend to strongly
emphasize women’s economic empowerment as a key driver for change.
Data from this report suggest there are three entry points through which governments are building on existing antipoverty programs to customize specific economic
inclusion efforts:
1. Social safety nets (SSNs)
2. Livelihoods and jobs (L&J)
3. Financial inclusion (FI)
While these entry points are not mutually exclusive—or exhaustive—they do serve
as a foundation on which investments can be built and broader sectoral collaborations can be achieved. This carries important operational implications. Governments
1

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

are deliberately integrating economic inclusion programs as part of national strategies
and frameworks for poverty reduction. Economic inclusion programs are seen as an
­important complement to existing antipoverty efforts. For example, as countries expand
the coverage and financing of safety nets, the terms social safety net–plus (SSN-plus)
or cash-plus are gaining prominence. Economic inclusion is a key driver of the
safety nets–plus agenda, the “plus” indicating the potential to complement cash with
additional inputs, service components, or links to external services. Ultimately a trend
from stand-alone to more integrated approaches presents opportunities for improved
program delivery and fiscal and policy coherence.
Despite much progress, the potential to scale up economic inclusion programs
is considered in light of critical debates on feasibility and program sustainability.
Economic inclusion programs may be considered too complex or too costly to o
­ perate
at scale. Governments in many countries, especially in low-income settings, will face
capacity constraints to administer and manage multidimensional and cross-sector
­interventions. As programs scale up, political economy factors become more prominent,
and the adoption and scale-up of economic inclusion programs will hinge on political
acceptability and involve trade-offs, especially around program objectives and ­priority
target groups. In this context, the report brings fresh perspective on program impacts
and costs, with the aim of better understanding the evidence base and fiscal realities
that will ultimately determine the question of scale.

Major Contributions of The State of Economic
Inclusion Report 2021
This report identifies 219 active economic inclusion programs in 75 countries, r­ eaching
nearly 92 million individuals, with additional programs in the planning phase.
The Partnership for Economic Inclusion (PEI) Landscape Survey 2020 (see a­ ppendix A)
reveals a variety of program implementers, but government programs are quickly
increasing, and government-led programs cover approximately 90 percent of program
beneficiaries and half of the projects surveyed (see figure O.1). Note that these figures
are a lower-bound baseline, given gaps in the available data, fast-moving project pipelines, and challenges in the reporting of coverage. However, these estimates provide
an important baseline to track the evolution of programs in the coming years. Many
of these programs are approaching an important inflection point, with expansion, and
greater refinement to address the needs of the poorest, to follow.

Technical Clarity
There is a need for definitional clarity and a common framework for economic
­inclusion, and that need underpins this report. The report focuses on economic
­inclusion programs that reach the extreme poor and the vulnerable. In this report,
economic inclusion involves the gradual integration of individuals and households into
broader economic and community development processes, with a focus on increasing
their incomes and assets and a view to strengthening their resilience and future opportunities. Economic inclusion programs often include a combination of cash or in-kind
transfers, skills training, coaching, access to finance, and links to market support.
These interventions cover a diverse landscape, including, among other efforts, productive inclusion, graduation, and community-driven development programs. Scaling up is
the process by which a program is established, expanded, or adapted under real-world
conditions into broader national policy and programming. Scaling up often builds

An Evidence Base
The need to establish a more comprehensive evidence base around economic inclusion
is a hallmark of this report. A central focus is the assimilation of new data and evidence
around program design and implementation, impacts, and costs. This is critical to determine the feasibility of program scale-up. Through the PEI Landscape Survey 2020, this
3

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

report brings together formerly disconnected strands of experiences in government and
nongovernment programs and across a range of sectors. The impact review ­documents
experiences across 80 quantitative and qualitative evaluations in 37 countries. The
report introduces the PEI Quick Costing Tool 2020 as a starting point to inform debates
on cost optimization and cost efficiency. Key data gathered throughout this report are
presented and will be updated on the PEI Data Portal available at http://peiglobal.org.
This open-access approach to data has been devised to encourage debate and to facilitate
new evidence generation over time.

Continued Learning
The report draws attention to the need for continued learning from first-hand country experiences. Adaptation to changing poverty contexts and megatrends is increasingly important. Economic inclusion programs are flexible and can be customized
to local settings, and major shocks, such as COVID-19, will fundamentally reshape
economic inclusion programs in each country. As the state of economic inclusion
evolves, new learning comes to light, and the report provides an in-depth set of
case studies highlighting lessons and operational insights from government-led and
nongovernment-led projects. The case studies include (1) the Sahel Adaptive Social
Protection Program, (2) India’s Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society (BRLPS),
locally known as JEEViKA’s Satat Jeevikoparjan Yojana, (3) BRAC’s Ultra Poor
Graduation program in Bangladesh, and (4) Peru’s Haku Wiñay program (box O.1).

BOX O.1 Learning by Doing: Four Case Studies
This report features four case studies that shed light on emerging lessons in the design
and implementation of economic inclusion programs in a variety of contexts. Findings
from these case studies, and wider survey data, underpin the key concepts and analysis
presented throughout this report.
The Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program (SASPP), supported by the World Bank and
development partners, features productive inclusion programs implemented in tandem
with the national safety net programs of four Sahel countries: Burkina Faso, Mauritania,
Niger, and Senegal. More than 50,000 households to date, across the four participating countries, have received a comprehensive package of products and services to help
them move out of poverty. A multicountry randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluation is
under way to determine the impact of these productive measures on cash transfer beneficiaries and how such measures can be optimized and made more cost-effective. The
case study presents insights on the importance of government leadership and institutional coordination, the value of broader investments in the safety net system, and the
need for flexibility in delivery arrangements depending on the country context.

such as targeting and delivering assets to poor households. SJY identifies and trains
large cadres of community members as frontline implementers of the program and
­demonstrates how large-scale government programs can alleviate implementation-­
related capacity constraints. Although at an early stage of implementation, SJY is
a large-scale effort intended to reach 100,000 households within JEEViKA’s larger
economic inclusion effort, which currently reaches 10 million rural women.
The BRAC case study reflects the experience of a large nongovernmental o
­ rganization
in pioneering the graduation approach, featuring their experience over the past
20 years and lessons emerging from recent innovations. BRAC’s graduation
program in Bangladesh has reached over 2 million households, accepting approximately 100,000 women heads of household into the program each year. An RCT evaluation on BRAC’s program demonstrated sizeable economic impacts that continue years
after the ­intervention. Other RCTs evaluating global graduation models have produced
similar positive impact results, which helped catalyze a global wave of graduation
and graduation-like programs. BRAC’s approach highlights the importance of longterm investment, constant adaptation, and innovation supported by research.
In Peru, the Haku Wiñay program, implemented by the Ministry of Development and
Social Inclusion, through the Social Development Cooperation Fund, is an economic
inclusion program introduced to create economic gains among the most disadvantaged rural households. This case study explores how an economic inclusion program
can integrate socially accepted community structures with a national program strategy
and ultimately replicate this approach. Successful scale-up is being achieved thanks
to participatory decision-making and the engagement of community project management systems and community trainers (yachachiqs). Replication required significant
adaptations, including giving implementers in different parts of the country the freedom
to apply locally relevant microstrategies to make the approach successful in varying
contexts of rural poverty.

Transforming the Lives of the Extreme Poor and
Vulnerable: A Framework
The report is anchored around a simplified framework to consider the pathways for
scaling up economic inclusion programs that strengthen resilience and opportunities of
the extreme poor and vulnerable. The framework (see figure O.2) illustrates an overall
context and response diagnostic linked to a desired set of outcomes at the household
and community level and in government systems. The framework was developed iteratively using findings from the underlying report survey, stakeholder consultations, and
available literature cited throughout. In presenting this framework, certain limitations
are noted: economic inclusion at scale is not a “silver bullet,” considerable heterogeneity is masked by a simplified framework, and the engagement of local community and
nongovernment structures remain critical to its execution. The framework presents a
starting point for ongoing discussion.

The starting point of the framework is the goal of transforming the economic
lives of the poor. Unleashing the productive potential of extreme poor and vulnerable people involves the removal of multiple constraints. Addressing both external
constraints related to community, local economy, and institutional failures and internal constraints reflecting intrahousehold dynamics and behavior is critical, although
internal constraints are less well understood. Improving integrated responses that link
the individual and household components of economic inclusion programs to wider
community and local economy processes is required. A multidimensional response
is proposed, the components of which are likely to evolve over time as learning and
­adaptation continue to develop.
Importantly, the framework centers on the potential to effect change within a
­government landscape, requiring clear alignment to national institutions, ­strategies,
and policies. This represents an important shift in popular discourse around economic
inclusion programs and leads to a consideration of the incentives, trade-offs, and strategic entry points in scale. Ultimately, the evolution of these programs at the country
level will hinge on political acceptability and will be shaped by several political economy considerations, such as historical processes, structural forces, and institutions. The
report highlights how governments face strong challenges in determining target groups,
often against a backdrop of excess demand and tight fiscal constraints. The success or
failure of economic inclusion programs will often rest on three programmatic decisions:
program objectives, financing, and institutional arrangements for delivery.

Ten Key Findings

1

An unprecedented surge in economic inclusion programming is occurring
worldwide. Survey data show inclusion programs are under way in at least
75 countries, reaching approximately 20 million households and benefiting

6

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

nearly 92 million individuals, either directly or indirectly. This report presents
data and evidence from 219 programs and the Partnership for Economic
Inclusion Landscape Survey 2020 identified a further 40 programs in the
planning stages. Nearly half of all programs worldwide are government led, and
these programs cover 93 percent of beneficiaries across all programs featured
in this report. Rapid expansion is driven by low-income countries; half of all
programs surveyed are in Sub-Saharan Africa.

2

There is strong potential for economic inclusion programs to build on preexisting
government programs, and this may prove critical in the long-term recovery
efforts arising from the COVID-19 economic crisis. Economic inclusion
is becoming a critical instrument in many governments’ large-scale antipoverty
programming. One of the primary means by which governments scale up
economic inclusion is through social safety nets, which offer an opportunity to
build on cash transfers. The scale-up of government programs has the potential
to introduce economies of scale and allow for integrated approaches. The report
points to the fact that government programs typically include five or more
components, most commonly transfers, skills training, coaching, market links,
and access to financial services.

3

The current scale of economic inclusion interventions is modest, and a
­sustainable approach to scaling up involves more than expanding program
beneficiary numbers. The Partnership for Economic Inclusion Landscape Survey
2020 shows that more than 50 percent of existing government-led programs have
the potential to support between 5 and 10 percent of the extreme poor. Many
government-led programs are in the process of expanding coverage. Yet scaling
up is not simply about the size of coverage but also about quality: the quality of
impact and sustainability of coverage as well as the quality of processes of change
and adaptation. Economic inclusion at scale therefore considers the associated
programmatic and institutional mechanics, many of which are important
prerequisites before introducing new program beneficiaries.

4

Economic inclusion programs provide considerable flexibility for
adaptations. Despite heterogeneity, there is common prioritization on rural
development, fragility, and the needs of specific vulnerable groups. The
Partnership for Economic Inclusion Landscape Survey 2020 revealed a strong
focus on protecting most vulnerable groups, including children (25 percent
of programs surveyed), people with disabilities (27 percent of programs
surveyed), and displaced populations (33 percent of programs surveyed). The
most frequently cited objectives for economic inclusion programs include selfemployment, income diversification, and resilience. This reflects an agenda with
a strong rural focus (87 percent of all programs) and an emphasis on fragility
(25 percent of programs surveyed) coupled with a focus on climate change
mitigation (55 percent of all programs surveyed).

5

Women’s economic empowerment is a key driver of economic inclusion
programming, with nearly 90 percent of programs surveyed having a
gender focus. Program design adaptations to promote empowerment and
mitigate unintended household and community risks have emerged. There
is a considerable body of operational work focused on explicit genderintentional program design to boost effectiveness. At the same time, there
is heightened interest and recognized risks in the unintended consequences
of gender-specific program adaptations, such as exacerbated time poverty,
reinforced traditional gender roles, and gender-based violence.

Economic inclusion programs look set to increasingly adapt to the realities of
informality, especially for youths in urban areas. Programmatic approaches vary,
with some self-employment interventions having broad inclusion objectives
and others explicitly seeking high-potential entrepreneurs. Only one-third of
programs facilitate access to wage employment opportunities, an agenda pushed
by government-led programs. Nearly 70 percent of programs help participants link
to existing value chains and markets (local, regional, national, or international),
and some even support the creation of new value chains. Almost 40 percent of
programs report operations in urban centers, with 64 percent of programs focused
on youth, reflecting broader demographic and urbanization megatrends. The
adaptation of economic inclusion programs to urban areas impacted by COVID-19
looks set to become an area of particular focus.
Digital innovations will be critical to leapfrog capacity constraints and to
strengthen program management. Many programs are currently utilizing
government social registries, beneficiary registries, and other government
databases to identify program participants (33 percent of all programs and
45 percent of government-led programs). Digital technology is an important
factor across 85 percent of all government-led programs and is prevalent in all
regions. Thirty percent of government-led programs provide access to program
components through digital platforms.
Economic inclusion programs build on a promising evidence base that will soon
grow significantly. A review of 80 quantitative and qualitative evaluations
in 37 countries shows that a bundle of coordinated multidimensional set of
interventions demonstrates greater impact on income, assets, and savings
relative to stand-alone interventions. The interactions between components
likely drive overall program impact. As highlighted in figure O.3, the existing
evidence base is dominated by nongovernment programs, which in many
cases are stand-alone programs. This is set to change in the coming years.
About 80 percent of the surveyed programs have planned research; results

from two-thirds of these studies will be available in 2020–21. The emergence
of greater evidence from government-led programs will be important for
rebalancing the discussion on program impacts, especially to reframe how
long-term impacts are understood within a national system of support.

An improved understanding of basic cost structures is a vital starting point
to assessing the cost-effectiveness of economic inclusion programs by more
than just “sticker price.” The report breaks new ground in the approach to
costing analysis, a topic fraught with complications, including challenges
in measurement, heterogeneity of program objectives, and complications in
comparability. It provides one of the first multicountry cost disaggregations
for government- and nongovernment-led economic inclusion programs
globally. The PEI Quick Costing Tool 2020, which facilitated data collection,
emerges in the absence of other operational costing tools critical to informing
real-time program design and policy dialogue.
  The cost of economic inclusion programs tends to be driven by a single intervention, such as cash grants, asset or input transfers, or safety net transfers
(figure O.4). Human resource and staff costs are more prominent cost drivers in
more complex projects, where costs are driven by multiple components, rather
than those driven by one large component provided in conjunction with others.
The size of the components varies considerably and depends on the modality
of support, for example, strictly time-bound or continuous support. The overall
price range of economic inclusion programs sampled varies ­substantially. The
total cost of economic inclusion programs is between $41 and $2,253 (in 2011
purchasing power parity, or PPP) per beneficiary over the duration (3.6 years
on average) of each program.2 This variance continues to exist when the
programs are further broken down by entry points: SSN programs range from
$77 to $2,253 (2011 PPP) and livelihoods and jobs programs range from $41 to

on their adequacy and impact.

10

Strong partnership is integral to the success of economic inclusion programs.
The engagement of community mechanisms is a critical driver of program
delivery, with most programs leveraging community structures, including
informal savings and credit community groups (42 percent), local governance
groups (59 percent), and formalized producer organizations (44 percent).
Community structures can further expand livelihood opportunities and
increase program sustainability, particularly if the community organizations
are formally linked to other market actors, including financial service providers
and private training providers. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) provide
technical assistance to 64 percent of government programs, and 67 percent
of governments partner with NGOs to deliver their programs. Partnership is
also critical at the global level to advance global operational knowledge, best
practices, learning, and leveraging financial support.

Future Directions
The report points to a continued and growing learning agenda around economic
inclusion for the poorest. Across the world, economic inclusion programs are being
customized to local settings, with programs invariably adopting a learning-by-doing
approach. The flexibility of economic inclusion programs makes them well suited to
adapt to changing poverty contexts and megatrends, such as informality, urbanization, demographic shifts, and technology. This flexibility also points to the potential
for the increased importance of economic inclusion programs in response to major
shocks, including the medium- to long-term response and recovery effort around
COVID-19. As programs evolve, the learning agenda will continue to grow, with
the promise of better informing the existing evidence base and bolstering political
buy-in for programs and approaches that demonstrate effectiveness. The Partnership
for Economic Inclusion will serve as an important platform to meet this demand for
knowledge and continued innovation and learning.

Delivery
Refining program delivery systems across diverse contexts will gain in importance.
Documentation of effective operational models and delivery systems in different
contexts is required to facilitate effective design and coordination of economic inclusion
programming. With a wide range of configurations of partners, programs, and structures under way, there are important opportunities to improve program effectiveness.
It will be important to gather evidence on the interplay between different government
institutions, and between government and partner organizations, such as community
networks, NGOs, and private sector firms. This evidence will help to reveal commonalities and key differences across each of the program entry points—a critical gap in
this report. Digital solutions can help to leapfrog some delivery constraints and increase
cost-effectiveness. These solutions will grow in prominence as social distancing restrictions affect training and coaching activities in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

Customization
Increasing customization based on the needs of specific population cohorts—­including
women, youths, and people with disabilities—is a certainty. As a cross-cutting priority, more economic inclusion programs will likely include specific design features
to promote women’s economic empowerment. Changes in the aspirations of youths
will also provide an important impetus for program expansion. Given high levels of
youth underemployment and uncertain pathways to formal jobs, economic inclusion
programs will play an important role in providing opportunities for self-employment
and microenterprise development. Demographic shifts and increased urbanization
are likely to fuel significant demand for these programs, as emerging experiences in
Bangladesh, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, and Kenya, among other countries, now suggest.
For people with disabilities, multidimensional economic inclusion programs can offer
a means of increasing their economic opportunities and reaching their full potential.
The body of knowledge on how to adapt design and delivery to increase outcomes for
people with disabilities to reach their full potential is growing. But nearly all programs,
regardless of their target populations, find that their participants’ performance trajectories differ, with some “fast climbers” and “slow climbers” in every group. These varying
trajectories have important implications for program design.

Shock Sensitivity
Programming for economic inclusion cannot be divorced from the vagaries of external
shocks, vulnerability, and fragility. Beyond the current COVID-19 context, the direction and nature of economic inclusion programs will also be shaped by different types
of shocks, including economic shocks or shocks caused by conflict or the effects of
climate change. As a response, economic inclusion programs in fragile settings are
increasing in size and number, and a better understanding of operational models in
these contexts is paramount. Good practice in linking economic inclusion to humanitarian interventions and facilitating market links for displaced and host populations will
be critical. One strong implication is the need for program adaptability and flexibility
to withstand shocks and to adapt program design in the context of dynamic short- and
medium-term needs.

Links to Community and Local Economy
As programs develop to address the needs of specific populations or demands of different contexts, the report makes clear the importance of linking traditional economic
inclusion responses for individuals and households with the wider community and
local economy processes. Economic inclusion programs foster links with existing
community structures, productive organizations, and savings networks. Improved
market and value chain links can increase the productivity of livelihood activities and
bolster program sustainability. Increased mesolevel linkages help alleviate structural
barriers and constraints to access to markets, infrastructure, and production inputs and
increase the potential of the private sector. Closer integration of these programs with
the local economy may also have important community spillover effects. As experience
grows, the menu of programmatic responses will likely evolve.

New Wave of Evidence
Given anticipated program innovations and ongoing research, the economic inclusion
knowledge base is set to grow. While there is much evidence already, the next wave
of evaluations will likely focus on government programs at scale and will help isolate
the mechanisms of impact across entry points and for different groups. This will have
important operational implications for identifying cost-effective bundles of interventions in each context and lessons on the effectiveness of different operational delivery
models. A critical learning agenda is emerging to help address several evidence gaps.
First, few studies provide details on the context in which programs operate, and a
major gap exists on cost analysis. Second, most evaluations are not designed to isolate
channels of impact, that is, to understand key drivers of program outcomes. Third,
there is very limited quantitative evidence on resilience and empowerment, with the
exception of some experiences from community-driven development programs. Going
forward, a new wave of evaluations will shape the state of global evidence significantly.
About 80 percent of the surveyed programs in this report have planned research and,
as noted, two-thirds of the results will be available by 2021. In moving the evaluation
agenda forward, there is a critical need to complement impact evaluations with realtime operational research, program-monitoring assessments, and qualitative fieldwork
to identify opportunities to enhance program performance.

Cost Effectiveness
The ability to determine program costs is an essential step in determining the cost-­
effectiveness of economic inclusion programs and their sustainability. The PEI Quick
Costing Tool 2020 developed as part of this report is a practical resource to guide practitioners through the disaggregation of costs in multidimensional programs. Going
forward, it is critical that economic inclusion program implementers (both government and nongovernment) and policy makers better scrutinize their cost structures
in order to increase program efficiency. Researchers assessing the impact of economic
inclusion programs should systematically collect and report on cost data in addition to impact sizes. The systematic understanding of costs will allow governments
to make sense of program cost-benefit ratios and guide their policy choices. Having
reliable costing data offers considerable scope to further understand cost optimization. Opportunities to optimize costs include variations in size and cost recovery of
cash grants and variations in intensity of modality, frequency, and content of training,
mentoring, and coaching.

Political Economy
Too often the discussion of economic inclusion and related programs focuses on
specific technical solutions for program design and implementation. This report draws
close attention to the “political economy” of economic inclusion to consider the local
and national considerations that influence the decision to adopt these programs or not.
The adoption and scale-up of economic inclusion programs hinges on political acceptability and involves trade-offs in program design and implementation. While economic
inclusion programs tend to have support across the political spectrum, governments
face strong challenges in the process of scaling up. The success or failure of economic
inclusion programs can be shaped by three decisions: program objectives, financing,
and institutional arrangements for delivery. Political realities may require that programs
cover a broad range of population cohorts, in addition to the poorest, often to ensure
12

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

popular support. As programs scale up, transparency and accountability measures
become important in limiting political bias. Two aspects stand out as critical for scaling
up economic inclusion: (1) political leadership and (2) the quality of evidence needed
to help shift preferences and bolster political support. These considerations—and the
perspectives of historical processes, structural forces, and institutions—underpin the
central question of scale-up, and occupy a cross-cutting focus throughout the report.

2. Note that here we do not divide the total cost by duration of each program. While dividing by
duration would help standardize the comparison across programs, it is misleading, as duration
of economic inclusion packages is an important aspect of the program’s design. Those
designed so their beneficiaries receive a set of interventions over a longer duration of time
(perhaps because they are slow climbers or highly vulnerable) will likely cost more than those
of shorter duration. In discussing adequacy of benefits, however, we standardize by duration.

Economic Inclusion: A Framework
KEY MESSAGES
Economic inclusion programs focused on extreme poor and vulnerable groups are
being implemented in at least 75 countries. This report presents data and evidence
from 219 programs. Economic inclusion programs are a bundle of coordinated,
multidimensional interventions that support individuals, households, and communities in
their efforts to increase their incomes and assets.
Governments lead program scale-up. Their efforts cover 93 percent of program
beneficiaries surveyed in the report. This carries important implications for design and
implementation.
Women’s economic empowerment is a key feature of program design. Nearly
90 percent of the programs surveyed in this report have a gender focus. Program
design adaptations to promote empowerment and mitigate unintended household and
community risks have emerged.
This report proposes a new framework for governments to strengthen the resilience
of and opportunities for the extreme poor and vulnerable. The framework envisions
the alignment of economic inclusion programs with national institutions, strategies,
and policies.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Adapting to changing poverty contexts and megatrends is increasingly important.
Economic inclusion programs are flexible and can be customized to local settings,
and major shocks such as COVID-19 will fundamentally reshape economic inclusion
programs in each country.
Unleashing the productive potential of the extreme poor and vulnerable involves
the removal of multiple constraints. Addressing both external constraints related to
community, local economy, and institutional failures and internal constraints reflecting
intrahousehold dynamics and behavior is critical, although internal constraints are less
well understood.
Improving integrated responses that link the individual and household components
of economic inclusion programs to wider community and local economy processes is
required. As a result, the menu of programmatic responses will likely grow over time as
learning and adaptation continues.

Introduction

R

ecent years have witnessed a growing global momentum to strengthen inclusive economic development and “leave no one behind.” The first challenge
posed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)—to “end poverty in all its
forms everywhere by 2030”—is being seized. A key action under the SDG agenda is
to address this challenge through inclusive and sustainable growth (SDG 8). Economic
inclusion initiatives that seek to do this are proliferating today, and they show strong
potential to build on preexisting national efforts to develop social protection systems
and jobs strategies worldwide.
Emerging evidence, including the experience of the 75 countries reviewed in this
report, illustrates both the potential for and challenges to governments to implement
economic inclusion initiatives at scale. This report features data and evidence from
219 economic inclusion programs across 75 countries, reaching in excess of 92 million
individuals.1 This estimate of program reach is considered a lower-bound baseline,
given gaps in the available data, fast-moving project pipelines, and challenges in the
reporting of coverage.
The scale-up of government-led programs is central to the operational surge
around economic inclusion. Government-led programs cover 90 percent of estimated
­beneficiaries in this report and half of the programs surveyed. These interventions
represent a diversity of approaches and are sometimes referred to as “productive
­inclusion,” ­“graduation,” or “community-driven” development programs. Common
interventions include a combination of cash or in-kind transfers, skills training or
coaching, access to finance, and links to market support (see box 1.1). Many of these
programs have now reached an important inflection point of expansion and refinement
to address the needs of the poorest.2
The potential to scale-up builds on a promising evidence base and a groundswell
of learning, especially in the nonprofit sector. This report places a spotlight on the role
of evidence and cost-effectiveness linked to economic inclusion programs. The report
recognizes a growing body of research, including the work of the 2019 Nobel laureates in economics.3 The rich tapestry of emerging evidence illustrates the capacities—
and ­limitations—of governments across the globe to implement programs at scale. The
methodology behind the survey of this tapestry of research is found in appendix A,
and details of the review of program impacts are in appendix B. The costing analysis,
covered in chapter 6, is detailed in appendix C. By way of illustration, four country
case studies supporting this report provide firsthand country experiences spanning a
range of contexts from Africa to South Asia to Latin America.

A Story of Great Expectations . . .
Expectations to strengthen economic inclusion recognize the persistence of poverty and
“poverty traps” facing the poor. The momentum to scale up occurs in the context of
stubbornly high levels of extreme poverty, whereby poverty becomes self-­reinforcing
and perpetual (Barrett, Carter, and Chavas 2019). By 2030, following a business-as-usual
scenario, an estimated 479 million people are projected to be living in extreme poverty,
and the share of global poor living in fragile and conflict-affected countries is expected
to reach 50 percent by 2030 (World Bank 2018). As of September 2020, the fallout from
the coronavirus pandemic raises the possibility of pushing more than 80 million people
into extreme poverty (see spotlight 1). Concerted efforts will be required to mitigate the
economywide or sector-specific downturns created by this pandemic and ultimately to
facilitate the restoration of livelihoods and the recovery of communities.
17

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

An effort to foster changes in the aspirations of the poor can provide an important
impetus for the expansion of economic inclusion programs. A discrete set of literature
considers how poverty lays the foundations for “aspirations failure” among the poor,
causing a “behavioral poverty trap” (Dalton, Ghosal, and Mani 2016). In this scenario,
internal psychological constraints of the poor perpetuate poverty. More recent events
and literature highlight opportunities and challenges related to changing aspirations
among certain cohorts. For example, recent events, including the Arab Spring and
protest movement of unemployed youths in countries of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, have contributed to the popular sentiment that access
to employment, earnings, and jobs is an important driver of social cohesion (Wietzke
and McLeod 2012). Across the Africa region, changing population dynamics and technology diffusion also bring into focus new aspirations of youth populations, particularly
in urban areas (Filmer and Fox 2014).
These changing aspirations put underemployment and jobs at the top of the
­development agenda. Yet labor markets remain, for the most part, informal, and
pathways to formal employment for the poorest are very limited. Informal labor is
widespread in developing countries, representing 70 percent of the labor force and
30 percent of the gross domestic product (Loayza 2018). Economic inclusion programs
provide opportunity to address these concerns, with the potential to create links in
the rural economy, across household enterprises, and, increasingly, to modern wage
sectors. In this context, economic inclusion programs provide promise to address the
needs of the extreme poor and vulnerable who have not yet benefited from broader
economic development.
The report focuses deliberately on the economic lives of the extreme poor and
vulnerable and the multiple constraints they face in increasing incomes and assets.
While transformative economic growth will be the ultimate driver of poverty reduction, it is not automatically inclusive and does not always penetrate the poorest households (Ravallion, Jolliffe, and Margitic 2018). Further, the needs of specific individuals
within those households are brought to the forefront. For example, women’s economic
empowerment is a key driver of economic inclusion programs, and program design and
adaptation focuses on the productive role of the woman in a household and community
(see spotlight 2). Similarly, efforts to address the needs of youth cohorts are important,
for youths increasingly lack pathways to formal employment and will require support
as “own account” workers in the labor market (see chapter 3).
To respond to growing expectations around economic inclusion programs, governments must navigate a range of political economy challenges. While economic
inclusion programs may garner strong support in principle, in practice competing
preferences and incentives shape the policy arena. As programs move to scale, there
will be several trade-offs inherent in policy choices, such as how scarce resources are
distributed across different population groups (see chapter 2). In this context, a logical
starting point for many governments is to customize existing antipoverty programs to
address economic inclusion ­priorities. At the center of this customization is an effort
to build on existing systems, policies, and capacities and ultimately to deliver cost-­
effective interventions at a reasonable level of scale.
In this report, we classify three primary entry points through which governments can
customize existing antipoverty programs and scale up economic inclusion:
1. Social safety nets (SSNs)
2. Livelihoods and jobs (L&J)
3. Financial inclusion (FI)
While these entry points are not mutually exclusive, they do provide a foundation
on which investments can be built and broader sectoral collaborations can be achieved.

The report draws attention to the strong links between social protection and jobs,
building on the considerable expansion of SSNs across the world. SSN programs—­
especially cash transfers—now reach about one-fifth of all households in low-­income
countries and represent approximately 26 percent of the income of the poorest.
As social protection systems mature, opportunities to strengthen broader sector links
become an imperative and critical to supporting mesolevel ­integration of economic
inclusion programs with other sectoral interventions, for example, agriculture, health
and sanitation, and environmental health and management.

. . . and Some Skepticism
While country adaptations, evaluations, and analyses provide direction in strengthening economic inclusion for the poor, the absence of a common framework and consistent terminology risks efforts to scale up. This report tackles this challenge by providing
a set of definitions, a typology of approaches, and a framework for action. These tools
draw from a variety of sector experience and survey data collected for the report,
including its four case studies. Some core definitions are explained in box 1.1; these are
expanded on throughout the report. A more detailed glossary of key terms is included
at the back of the report.

BOX 1.1

Defining Terms: What We Mean by Economic Inclusion and Scale

Economic inclusion: This report considers economic inclusion as the gradual integration of
individuals and households into broader economic and community development processes.
This integration is achieved by addressing multiple constraints or structural barriers faced
by the poor at different levels: the household (for example, human and physical capacity),
the community (social norms), the local economy (access to markets and services), and
formal institutions (access to political and administrative structures). Throughout the report,
these constraints are viewed as simultaneous and often inseparable. They are viewed as
impacting extreme poor and vulnerable groups most intensively.
Economic inclusion programs are a bundle of coordinated, ­multidimensional interventions
that support individuals, households, and communities to increase their incomes
and assets. Economic inclusion programs therefore aim to facilitate the dual goal of
strengthening resilience and opportunities for individuals and households who are poor.
These goals are met through strengthening community and local economy links. The term
economic inclusion is sometimes used interchangeably with the term productive inclusion.
Scale: Scaling up is the process by which a program shown to be effective on a small scale
or under controlled conditions or both is expanded, replicated, and adapted into broader
policy and programming. Scale-up may also be driven without prior piloting and testing,
and often in response to a political decision or directive. It is not simply about coverage—
the number of beneficiaries served by the program in relation to the total population of
the country—but also about quality—of impact and sustainability of coverage as well as
processes of change and adaptation. Economic inclusion at scale therefore considers the
programmatic and institutional mechanics required to embed programs at the national
level through large-scale antipoverty programs, led by governments with clear alignment
to national strategies, partnership development, and underlying political economy
considerations. In this report, entry points to scaling up are the foundational elements on
which other measures are subsequently layered: social safety nets, l­ivelihoods and jobs,
and financial inclusion.

Key debates boil down to feasibility. Economic inclusion programs may be
considered too complex and too costly to operate at scale. Governments in many
countries, especially in low-income settings, will face capacity constraints to administer and manage multidimensional and cross-sector interventions. Across a broad
strand of literature, many of these debates have concerned “graduation” programs,
implemented largely by nonprofit organizations (see chapters 2 and 3). These
programs have generated discussion and controversy regarding their complexity,
targeting efficacy, cost-effectiveness, capacity requirements, and conceptual underpinnings (Soares and Orton 2017; Devereux and Sabates-Wheeler 2015; Sulaiman
et al. 2016). More broadly, the time-bound nature of many economic inclusion
programs may be considered at odds with the notions of social protection as a right
and universal social protection across a continuum of needs. These challenges are
explored throughout chapters 3 and 4.
There is ongoing debate surrounding the impact and cost-effectiveness of economic
inclusion approaches—two topics that take center stage in chapters 5 and 6. A wide
range of literature is reviewed in chapter 5, which unpacks the promising evidence base
for economic inclusion programs. This evidence base—much of it drawn from nonprofit
program implementation—has helped operationalize the agenda on economic inclusion, despite concerns related to the heterogeneity and size of program impacts. Over
the next two years, a wave of new impact and process evaluations are anticipated from
national programs that will inform this debate. Much debate focuses on the marginal
impact of high-cost components and options for effectively customizing the bundle of
interventions for different target groups. Chapter 6 explores these debates, highlighting
options for improved costing analysis and cost optimization. It is in this context that
the report sets out to identify key directions for the next generation of economic inclusion programs, as well as deciphering which expectations of the debate are misplaced
or well-founded.

A Framework to Transform Economic Lives
A central contribution of this report is a framework to consider the pathways for
­scaling up economic inclusion programs that strengthen resilience and opportunities so that beneficiaries can better participate in the local economy. The framework (see figure 1.1) illustrates an overall context and response diagnostic linked
to a desired set of outcomes at the household and community level as well as to
government systems. The framework was developed iteratively using findings from
the underlying report survey, stakeholder consultations, and available literature.
This framework represents a baseline designed to inform ongoing discussion. This
section introduces the framework applied throughout the report, with the subsequent sections summarizing each aspect of the framework.
The starting point of this framework is the central challenge of transforming the economic lives of the poor. While this report focuses on economic inclusion programs targeted to the extreme poor or vulnerable, it is recognized
that economic inclusion programs can be of benefit to a range of population
segments across different economic strata. It is also recognized that governments
will face competing demands across those population segments. When implemented
at scale, adjusting a program approach and weighing trade-offs between serving one group or another are often required. This discussion is carried forward in
­chapter 2.
The framework centers on the potential to effect change in a government
­landscape, requiring clear alignment to national institutions, strategies, and p
­ olicies.
This framework is anchored by considerations of the entry points through which

governments can customize existing antipoverty programs and the adaptations to scale.
The entry points to scale are the foundational elements on which other measures are
layered: SSNs, L&J, and FI. Adaptations to scaling up involve the programmatic and
institutional means by which programs evolve and grow, all filtered through a political
economy lens.
In presenting this framework, certain limitations are worth bearing in mind.
•• First, economic inclusion at scale is not a “silver bullet.” The framework advances
a household and local economy perspective best situated in a wider government
response to address poverty. Therefore, household- and local-level economic inclusion strategies need to be mindful of, and ideally complement, those national and
mid-level investments that greatly influence welfare outcomes.
•• Second, the framework masks the considerable heterogeneity that defines economic
inclusion programs across different country settings. As noted throughout the report,
the starting point and trajectory of different population groups, and in different
operating contexts, will shape program design and implementation choices. For
example, the program objectives and core target populations will vary between a
middle-income national context and a low-income fragile one. In the end, program
impacts will also vary for different types of programs, for similar programs in different contexts, and for the same program across different population groups. Factors
that drive impact will depend on the ecosystem in which programs operate—on both
market- and community-level factors—and on the characteristics of participating
households and individuals.
•• Third, the engagement of local community and nongovernmental structures is critical
in the execution of this framework. The relative complexity of economic inclusion
programs requires the involvement of multiple program partners, including community groups, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector organizations. As elaborated in chapter 3, there is a wide range of nongovernment experience
21

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

in the execution and support of economic inclusion programs. At the same time,
several nongovernment-led programs operate outside of national systems, often
where capacities are weak, conflict or fragility abound, or political will is absent.
In some cases, continued nongovernmental programming may reflect a path dependency or reluctance for adaptation.

Goal and Outcomes
The goal and outcomes of the framework (figure 1.1) must be seen against a backdrop of dynamic poverty, tumultuous economic factors, and political economy
constraints. This section considers the broad poverty and economic trends underpinning the framework and previews a broader political economy discussion in
­chapter 2. Megatrends potentially shaping the direction of economic inclusion
programs are highlighted.
Shifting poverty dynamics bring into focus the potential value of tailored economic
inclusion programs to improve resilience and opportunities for the poorest. Global
poverty has steadily declined for many decades, but that decline is now narrowing,
and trends are seeing a reversal for the first time since 1998 (see figure 1.2). Before
COVID-19, the world already faced a daunting poverty outlook: continuing with business as usual, an estimated 479 million people were facing extreme poverty by 2030
(World Bank 2018). These estimates mask substantial variations across regions and
contexts. Poverty rates remain stubbornly high in low-income countries, particularly
those affected by conflict and political upheaval. By 2030, it is predicted that 87 percent
of the extreme poor worldwide will be in Sub-Saharan Africa (see figure 1.2). A similar trajectory is likely for countries affected by fragility and conflict, with poverty rates
stuck at over 40 percent for the past decade and where up to two-thirds of the world’s
extreme poor may reside by 2030 (Corral Rodas et al. 2020).
In the new COVID-19 context, the ongoing crisis will erase almost all the progress made in the past five years—thereby compounding existing challenges in rural
and fragile settings and raising demand from the “new poor,” urban economies, and
migrant populations (World Bank 2020). The World Bank estimates that 70 to 100
million more people will fall into extreme poverty (under $1.90 per day) in 2020
compared to 2019 as a result of COVID-19, depending on assumptions on the magnitude of the economic shock. The global extreme poverty rate could rise by 0.3 to 0.7
percentage points, to around 9 percent, in 2020. Additionally, the percentage of people
living on less than $3.20 a day could rise by 0.3 to 1.7 percentage points, to 23 percent
or higher, an increase of some 40 to 150 million people. Finally, the percentage of
people living on less than $5.50 a day could rise by 0.4 to 1.9 percentage points, to 42
percent or higher, an increase of around 70 to 180 million people. It is important to
note that these poverty projections are highly volatile and could differ greatly across
countries.
High and, in some cases, rising levels of inequality threaten to dilute shared prosperity and reduce opportunities in many countries for the poor to move out of poverty.
Although evidence points to a slight recent decline in total global inequality (Revenga
and Dooley 2019), inequality within the world’s economies is greater today than it
was 25 years ago, and it is increasing, although at disparate rates. Notwithstanding
improved living standards for people in the bottom 40 percent of the income range
over recent decades, relatively more income is being captured by the highest quintiles.
Between 1980 and 2016, the global share of income held by the top 1 percent grew
from 16 percent to more than 20 percent, while the share held by the bottom 50 percent
of the world’s population remained stagnant at around 9 percent (Alvaredo et al. 2018).

Moreover, countries with high rates of poverty, most of which are in Sub-Saharan
Africa, have seen the lowest income growth among the bottom 40 percent, while
average incomes have stagnated or even declined in countries affected by fragility or
conflict (World Bank 2018). The bottom 40 percent live disproportionally in rural areas,
attain less education, and are more likely to be children.
Finally, informal employment and underemployment cast a long shadow on how
economic inclusion programs are likely to evolve. Sixty percent of the world’s population make their living in the informal economy, including more than 85 percent of
the population in Africa (ILO 2018). The agriculture sector accounts for 68 percent
of work in low-­income countries (Djankov et al. 2018), where the rural landless poor
are commonly employed in low-paid, insecure activities. Informality also characterizes urban poverty, a critical concern as urban populations are projected to more than
double by 2050—with cities in Africa to double in size faster, over the next 20 years
(Djankov et al. 2018; Kharas et al. 2020). In the context of burgeoning youth populations and the search for effective strategies to address underemployment, these forecasts may have serious implications for economic inclusion programs.
The framework focuses on enhancing resilience and opportunity for the poor.
•• Resilience refers to the strengthened ability of a household to manage risk and
respond to and cope with sudden shocks that are likely to overwhelm them. When
income and assets increase through economic inclusion, households can maintain
consumption and avoid the need to resort to costly and often irreversible coping
strategies, such as selling their most productive assets at fire-sale prices or sending
children to work rather than to school (Ralston, Andrews, and Hsiao 2017). More
resilient households can also generate positive externalities for communities by
contributing to local economic recovery in the aftermath of shocks.
•• Opportunity refers to the capacity of households in economic inclusion programs
to capture and capitalize on investments that improve human capital outcomes
and that they would otherwise miss (Hernandez 2020; Ralston, Andrews, and

Hsiao 2017). Such investments can help to propel individuals and households out
of poverty through improved productivity and access to jobs (World Bank 2012).
Capturing better opportunities can also contribute to broader household gains,
including for children, such as improved consumption, nutrition, and education.
In this overall context, the framework and broader report focus on two outcomes
of interest.
•• First, they focus on increasing incomes and assets of individuals, households, and
communities. The programs surveyed for this report typically use household-level
targeting criteria, reflecting the design intent of the initiative and a contextually
appropriate means of determining eligibility. Interventions at the individual level are
an important feature of economic inclusion programs but are typically devised to
account for intrahousehold dynamics (for example, engagement of male household
members as well as consideration for care and other work burdens). An additional
feature across programs is the engagement of local communities and, increasingly,
links to local market structures. Economic inclusion programs by nature leverage
community structures and groups, including informal community savings and credit
groups, local governance groups, formalized producer organizations, and different
group cohorts (for example, youths). A policy implication emerges that suggests
that successful economic inclusion at scale will be contingent on effective mesolevel
links—a theme that is further assessed in spotlight 3 and later chapters.
•• Second, the framework and report focus on strengthening government systems for
improved program delivery as well as fiscal and policy coherence. The report focuses
squarely on the potential to link economic inclusion programs to national policies and strategies such as, for example, social protection and L&J strategies. These
different sector entry points are not simply additional features of economic inclusion
programs, but rather sine qua nons, essential conditions, without which government
programs will not be sustainable. These systems provide a basis on which programs
can be scaled and customized. Chapter 2 explores the political economy considerations and the broad set of policy decisions and trade-offs that will help shape the
interventions that are devised. This has important institutional implications, since
the successful scale-up of economic inclusion programs will require careful coordination across government at different levels: the central, decentralized, and local
levels, as discussed further in chapters 3 and 4.

Context and Response: Customizing to Local Settings
The framework is influenced by the poverty trap hypothesis, which explains conditions
under which poverty becomes self-reinforcing and perpetual. While recent decades
have seen hundreds of millions escape dire poverty and premature death (Deaton
2013), extreme poverty continues to persist, alongside increasing inequality both in and
between countries. According to the poverty trap hypothesis, the poorest population
groups have fundamentally different opportunities than other people as a result of their
poverty (Parry, Burgess, and Bandiera 2020; Balboni et al. 2020). The poor face multiple
constraints to improving their earning opportunities and assets, such as low levels of
human capital and limited access to productive inputs. This is compounded by frequent
exposure to uninsured risks, both man-made and natural (Dercon 2008), and a reduction in cognitive bandwidth that impairs decision-making (Mani et al. 2013; Haushofer
and Fehr 2014; Mullainathan and Shafir 2013). In combination, these factors can trap

24

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

individuals, households, communities, and economies in poverty, perpetuating a cycle
that limits investments to low-productivity endeavors.
A central argument of the framework is that the poor and vulnerable encountering poverty traps face multiple constraints, around which a multidimensional response
is required. The framework proposes that multiple constraints fall on these populations with the greatest force, and often simultaneously. Multiple constraints impede
the ability of the poor to improve their earning opportunities not only in the short
run—whether through wage employment or self-employment—but also over the longer
term. This is an area of extensive research and operational focus (for example, Daidone
et al. 2019; Barrientos 2012; FAO 2015). Recent empirical evidence suggests that an
intervention that provides an initial amount of capital above a critical threshold ultimately determines whether households can capture higher productivity opportunities
and progress out of poverty. These findings suggest that large enough transfers or “big
push” approaches have the potential to permanently move individuals to a higher level
of wealth (Parry, Burgess, and Bandiera 2020).
This report considers four domains that highlight the external and internal
constraints that may limit the economic lives of the poor (figure 1.3).
1. The first set of constraints that beneficiaries may face is at the individual and
­household levels, human and physical capacity constraints that limit their income-­
generating ­potential. These include human capital (including cognitive, noncognitive, and ­technical skills); physical and financial capital (including durable assets,
land, savings, and insurance); and social capital. In addition, intrahousehold dynamics that shape aspirations and determine distribution of time use, labor supply, and
resources can be a significant constraint for some individuals, especially women and
people with disabilities.
2. A second set of constraints concerns aspects at the community level (such as social
norms and gender expectations, as well as local infrastructure, connectivity, and
exposure to disaster risk), which may affect some groups or all households in the
community. These constraints may vary significantly across communities and across
groups in communities.
3. A third set of constraints occurs in the local economy. This includes underlying factors that constrain opportunities for economic growth, such as proximity
to ­physical markets, regional market depth, access to connective infrastructures,
and production inputs. Many of the world’s extremely poor live in isolated, rural
­localities where access to local and regional markets is limited.
4. The fourth constraint involves formal institutions. It includes institutional and
government failures, including lack of access to political and administrative
­structures as well as civil society organizations and NGO networks. Throughout the
report, these constraints are viewed as simultaneous and often inseparable. They are
viewed as impacting most intensively the extreme poor and vulnerable, for whom
these interlocking deprivations can create poverty traps.
Under this framework, constraints facing women are of special concern and
are further discussed in firsthand country experiences cited in the case studies. Experience suggests that economic inclusion efforts have strong potential to
strengthen women’s economic empowerment through intentionally designed programs
and specific ­adaptations in program delivery, for instance, hiring female community ­facilitators. However, realizing empowerment opportunities at scale presents
­operational ­challenges. Adverse effects of targeting women for economic empowerment programs may include ­exacerbated time poverty, because women’s usual care

responsibilities are not commensurately reduced. In addition, there may be short-term
increases in ­intimate-partner violence, due to perceived threats to traditional masculinity and gender roles (Laszlo 2019). Considerable innovation is ongoing in this domain,
as reflected throughout the report, including in spotlight 2, “Promoting Women’s
Economic Empowerment through Economic Inclusion.”
The framework proposes a bundled package of interventions that supports the
poorest and most vulnerable households to tackle multiple constraints. While the
measures will vary considerably across countries and contexts—often shaped by
specific megatrends (see box 1.2)—the report identifies a common set of multidimensional interventions, which may include some form of cash or in-kind t­ransfer, skills
training or coaching, access to finance, and, increasingly, links to market support.
These interventions may be delivered in a time-bound capacity and a deliberately
sequenced manner. This design response is informed by observed experiences in graduation-focused programs, although economic inclusion extends significantly beyond
a graduation framework (see chapter 2). It is also informed by ongoing experiences
across broader sectors and program areas, for example, SSNs, community-driven
­development programs, rural livelihood, and environmental management.
The underlying assumption is that a comprehensive suite of interventions has
greater and more sustained impact on income, assets, and well-being relative to standalone interventions. For instance, common constraints to setting up a microenterprise

BOX 1.2 M
 egatrends Driving the Future Direction of Economic Inclusion at the
Country Level
This report considers megatrends as structural shifts that are long term in nature and
have irreversible consequences for economies and societies at large. Two overarching
megatrends are patterns in extreme poverty and informality, highlighted throughout this
report. The report also acknowledges four other megatrends that will directly impact
country-level program design and implementation for economic inclusion programs:
human capital formation, demographic trends, shock sensitivity, and technological
innovation.
Human capital formation: Shortfalls in health and education among children today
have substantial implications for national economies and the productivity of the next
generation of workers. A child born in a country at the 25th percentile of the global
distribution of education and health will, upon reaching adulthood, be only 43 percent
as productive as a child with a full education and good health (Gatti et al. 2018).
Evidence shows that economic inclusion and human capital are closely intertwined,
with important intergenerational consequences.
Enhanced human capital can strengthen the impact of economic inclusion programs
on wages and productivity, because beneficiaries are then better placed to exercise
agency, access and process information, and take risks in productive investments.
Conversely, participation in economic inclusion can strengthen a beneficiary’s human
capital through improved skills, agency, and networks, while earnings can be invested
in their own as well as their families’ human capital. Accrued income can also militate
against negative coping mechanisms during times of crisis, for instance, by allowing
children to remain in school and for household health and nutrition needs to be met.
Population dynamics with specific impacts on urbanization: The total population in
the world will reach almost 10 billion by 2050, compared to around 7.7 billion in 2019
(UNDESA 2019a). Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to double by 2050 due to its higher
fertility rate, while Eastern and Southeastern Asia will experience a modest 3 percent
increase (Suzuki 2019; UNDESA 2019a). This raises challenges because people living
in extreme poverty are disproportionately rural, female, and children. Furthermore,
the global population is getting older, with the number of people over 65 expected to
double to more than 1.5 billion by 2050. The least developed countries will experience
the fastest increase in this regard (UNDESA 2020).a Lastly, all the population growth
between 2018 and 2050 is projected to take place in urban areas that will inevitably be
situated in the poorest economies (UNDESA 2019b). While urbanization has generally
been conducive to economic growth, pro-poor policies in the urban context will be
needed to harness this trend toward shared prosperity.
Shock sensitivity, fragility, and conflict: As recent events have made clear,
programming for economic inclusion cannot be divorced from the vagaries of external
shocks and vulnerability. Beyond the current COVID-19 context, the direction and
nature of economic inclusion programs will also be shaped by different types of shocks,
including economic shocks as well as underlying fragility due to conflict or climate
change. In 2015, 54 percent of those living in fragile and conflict affected situations
(FCS) were in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank 2018). While extreme poverty in FCS
economies declined sharply between 2005 and 2011, the poverty rate has since

Country Level (continued)
stagnated, and the share of the global poor living in FCS has steadily increased since
2010, amounting to 23.2 percent of the world’s extreme poor. The report Financing the
End of Extreme Poverty identifies 30 countries that are most at risk of not meeting the
2030 goal of eradicating extreme poverty (Manuel et al. 2018). Of these countries, 23
with economic inclusion interventions are featured in this report. One strong implication
is the need not only for program adaptability and flexibility to withstand shocks but to
adapt program design in the context of dynamic, short- and medium-term needs.
Technology adoption: Rapid adoption of technology and the increasing use of mobile
phones, which allow people in developing countries to become more connected,
is proving to be an enormous opportunity. Today there are more mobile phone
subscriptions in the world than people, with over 50 percent of the global population
having access to broadband internet (ITU 2018). Additionally, there are now over
1 billion registered mobile money accounts globally, helping increase financial inclusion
(GSMA 2019). While such rapid adoption has the potential to bring about positive
change, it can also exacerbate existing inequalities and introduce new vulnerabilities.
It is important to note that a digital divide persists—half of the world’s population is still
offline. Most of these people live in developing countries, and increasingly they are
women (World Bank 2016; ITU 2019).

include inadequate business knowledge or skills, lack of finance, imperfect insurance,
and limited social networks. While stand-alone interventions can also impact incomes,
assets, and resilience, a single intervention—such as a regular cash transfer alone, business training alone, or access to finance alone—may not necessarily help those facing
multiple constraints or would do so to a lesser extent. Evidence of the marginal impact
of these stand-alone interventions as compared with a coordinated package is emerging
and is further addressed in chapter 5.

Entry Points and Adaptations: Moving to Scale
The report considers strategic entry points to scale as well as key programmatic and
institutional adaptations to ensure the success of programs. These mechanisms are
now briefly introduced here and expanded throughout chapters 2, 3, and 4. They also
inform the case study summaries presented in the report.
Although economic inclusion programs are multidimensional, they generally
include a foundational intervention that acts as the primary entry point, with other
measures subsequently layered on top. Drawing on the survey of programs undertaken
for this report, three core entry points are identified. These entry points are not mutually exclusive and entail a strong overlap. Chapter 2 considers the following primary
entry points in further detail:
•• Leveraging social safety net interventions: As countries expand the coverage and
financing of SSN programs, in particular, cash transfers—the terms safety nets–plus
or cash-plus are gaining prominence. The plus indicates the potential to complement
28

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

cash with additional inputs, service components, or links to external services.
Economic inclusion is a key driver of the SSN-plus agenda, showing particular promise to maximize impacts on incomes and productivity. The continuous provision
of SSNs and the incorporation of beneficiaries into a social protection system is a
potential game changer in the design of economic inclusion programs. It implies
a shift from one-off and time-bound interventions to a more regularized system
of support with the potential for refresher interventions along the way. This also
has the potential to reframe expectations around the sustainability and long-term
impacts of such programs.
•• Integrating strategies to promote more and better livelihoods and jobs: For the poorest and most vulnerable, access to employment tends to be informal, risky, and
often limited by constraints to labor supply—human capital, including education,
skills, and networks—and labor demand—business environment, including access
to finance, infrastructure, technology, and markets. An increasing number of L&J
programs focus on removing barriers that keep the extreme poor and vulnerable
(for example, poor households in rural or urban areas that include youths, refugees,
and women) from participating in the local economy and in higher productivity
jobs. Economic inclusion approaches to L&J strategies for the poorest are shaped by
thinking about sustainable livelihoods (risk management, community-driven development, and local economic development strategies) and, more recently, on the
changing nature of work. Notwithstanding challenges, economic inclusion programs
have the potential to leverage both formal and informal wage employment opportunities, including through public works and value chain development.
•• Strengthening financial inclusion and payment systems: Many poor population
segments tend to be excluded from financial services, including credit, savings,
insurance, and e-payments or mobile money. Financial inclusion, through the use
of savings groups, formal banking services, microcredit, government-to-person
payments, and so on, has the potential to improve resilience and opportunities for
the extreme poor and the vulnerable, particularly women. An increasing proportion of countries are using mechanisms to deliver social protection transfers directly
to bank accounts, electronically or otherwise, creating an entry point to bring
people into the formal financial sector and offering a pathway to a broader range
of ­financial services, including savings and credit. More recently, digital services
have lowered the cost of connecting excluded groups to the formal financial system,
using new technologies and business models such as pay-as-you-go asset finance
and fintech.
Because of the multidimensional nature of economic inclusion programs, there
may be considerable overlap between the entry points to scale. Most programs have a
secondary entry point that balances the emphasis of the focus of an intervention. For
instance, an economic inclusion program with an SSN at its core may overlap with an
FI intervention—the former being the primary intervention and the latter being the
secondary. There tends to be strong overlap across SSN and L&J interventions, often
reflecting common objectives around income diversification and productivity. Moving
to scale will therefore involve linking and integrating different interventions and
programs across the various entry points.
As programs scale up, they will be strongly shaped by each country’s political realities and customized along several policy and institutional dimensions (see
­chapters 2 and 4). Economic inclusion at scale must consider several programmatic
and institutional mechanisms required to embed programs at the national level. As
noted previously, the report focuses on the scale-up of economic inclusion programs
through large-scale antipoverty programs led by governments, with clear alignment
29

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

to national strategies, partnership development, and underlying political economy
considerations.
The concept of scaling up is the process by which a program shown to be effective on a small scale or under controlled conditions or both is expanded, replicated,
and adapted into broader policy and programming. Scaling up is about quality of
impact, scale, and sustainability, as well as processes of change and adaptation; the
concept goes beyond a functional consideration of coverage. Chapter 4 continues
this discussion by considering country-level progress on five different dimensions of
scale:
•• Coverage
•• Functional expansion
•• Policy and strategy formulation
•• Organizational reform
•• Operational planning

Future Directions
The flexibility of economic inclusion programs to serve different target groups
and contexts is a key feature of this report. Going forward, further emphasis on
the adaptive nature of economic inclusion programs reflecting changing poverty
contexts and megatrends (such as demographics, urbanization, and technology) is
important to enhancing the resilience of and opportunity for the poor. At the time
of writing in autumn 2020, living history reminds us that major shocks (COVID-19)
have the potential to fundamentally reshape economic inclusion programs at the
country level. It is important to recognize the principle that no single blueprint can
be wholly replicated in a given setting or during a major shock. Maintaining flexibility can ensure that overall implementation is achieved and regional coherence
maintained.
Economic inclusion programs will need to more strongly address external and
internal constraints that limit the productive potential of the extreme poor and vulnerable. External constraints tend to focus on issues related to community, local economy,
and institutional failures. Internal constraints reflect intrahousehold dynamics as well
as behavioral aspects, which are less understood than other factors in program implementation. Addressing both external and internal constraints is critical to strengthening
the resilience and opportunity of the extreme poor and vulnerable. The engagement of
local community and nongovernmental structures will remain critical in tackling these
constraints.
There is strong recognition of the need for integrated responses, linking individual and household components of economic inclusion programs to wider community
and local economy processes. In this respect, the menu of interventions may grow over
time, as learning and adaptation continues. Over the next several years, a wave of new
impact and process evaluations across scaled programs will provide key lessons in scaling. At the same time, the design and implementation of new programs will continue to
be informed by ongoing experiences across broader sectors and program areas, among
them SSN, community-driven development programs, rural livelihoods, and environmental management.

Notes
1. Note that 201 programs reported beneficiary data; 18 programs are missing beneficiary data.
2. The poorest refers to people in a number of economic categories that include several

dimensions of poverty and vulnerability. The poor are those whose consumption is below
the national poverty line, as defined by the government, or those who, because of their
personal and/or community characteristics, face barriers in accessing opportunities to
earn sustainable livelihoods and have elevated risks of being or staying in poverty and/
or being socially marginalized. The extreme poor are those whose consumption is below
$1.90 per day (2011 purchasing power parity, PPP), also defined as the bottom 50 percent
of the poor population in a country or those unable to meet basic needs. The latter
definition captures relative poverty, as well as dynamics in lower-middle-income and
upper-middle-income countries. Since 2018 the World Bank has reported poverty rates using
two new international poverty lines: the lower-middle-income line is set at $3.20 per day,
and the upper-middle-income line is set at $5.50 per day. The ultrapoor are those whose
consumption is below $0.95 per day (2011 PPP). Also defined as those experiencing the
most severe forms of deprivation, for example, persistent hunger, lack of sources of income,
and so forth. Finally, the other vulnerable are groups who do not meet any of the above
criteria, for example, those just above the poverty line and marginalized groups irrespective
of their poverty level.

SPOTLIGHT 1

Economic Inclusion and COVID-19
Recovery
The world is experiencing an unprecedented economic crisis due to the COVID-19
pandemic. Economic inclusion programs for the poorest show strong potential as part
of integrated policy responses focused on containing the pandemic, ­ensuring food
­security, and supporting medium-term recovery. Beyond the immediate public health
crisis, the global economy is projected to shrink by 3 percent in 2020, with only a
partial recovery projected for 2021 (IMF 2020). In the most conservative scenario,
assuming a 5 percent contraction in per capita incomes, more than 80 million people
could be pushed into extreme poverty. Assuming per capita incomes shrink by
10 percent, that number could grow by an estimated additional 180 million people
(Sumner, Hoy, and Ortiz-Juarez 2020). The adverse effects on employment, ­especially
in the informal sector, are expected to be far reaching and unprecedented. The
International Labour Organization (ILO 2020) estimates that 305 million full-time
­workers could be unemployed or underemployed as a result of the crisis.
The COVID-19 pandemic is not a great equalizer—the poor and vulnerable are
hit much worse. These groups typically face greater health risks compounded by an
inability to meet social distancing norms in densely populated informal settlements
and inadequate resources to seek testing and treatment. The COVID-19 crisis is likely
to exacerbate poverty and destitution, with the accompanying economic downturn
depressing demand for labor, goods, and services, severely curtailing income-­generation
opportunities for the poor and vulnerable (Carranza et al. 2020; World Bank 2020).
Furthermore, the pandemic can potentially exacerbate existing gender inequalities and
further marginalize people with disabilities.

Adaptation and Early Priorities in a COVID-19
Context
Economic inclusion programs face a dual challenge of adapting delivery norms during
a pandemic and ensuring readiness to respond as part of the medium- and longer-term
recovery effort. In the short term, ongoing economic inclusion programs can provide
an immediate gateway to support existing beneficiaries, their communities, and the
local economy. However, significant adaptations are required to avoid pandemic risks.
Irrespective of medium-term policy responses, short-term disruption to programs is
anticipated, with some operations being put on hold and others facing delays in fieldwork activities, for example, in-person data collection, beneficiary selection, group
meetings, and so on. To mitigate these impacts, economic inclusion programs need to
modify the design and delivery of components. In program design, emerging priorities
are the following:
1. Incorporate elements that mitigate health risks. Economic inclusion programs
can serve as a platform for the delivery of reliable and current health ­messaging.
In ­addition, programs can expand messaging to counter concerns of a possible
rise in gender-based violence following containment measures. More generally,
the COVID-19 crisis has starkly highlighted the importance of access to affordable
finance. Such access can help with hospital bills, medicine, cash to replace lost
34

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

income, and capital to restart businesses once containment measures are lifted.
Furthermore, economic inclusion programs can layer interventions to mitigate health
risks where feasible. To mitigate health risks related to COVID-19, programs can link
with existing health insurance programs, waive co-payment requirements, or subsidize the premium for poor and vulnerable groups.
2. Cope with market disruptions and anticipate possible livelihood opportunities. As
markets continue to falter, economic inclusion programs must adapt to cope with
frequent, unpredictable disruptions and anticipate possible livelihood opportunities.
Programs need to work with beneficiaries to identify livelihood options that can be
run safely and to develop a plan to adapt to the ever-present threat of market disruption. Even during the strictest containment measures, economic inclusion programs
have an advantage because microentrepreneur beneficiaries are engaged in highly
decentralized production, whether they are individual, group, or community based.
Support to these institutions will help sustain productive inclusion, local economic
development, and jobs during and after the COVID-19 crisis. Self-help groups, for
example, are known to lead to increased business-related spending, resilience, and
food security.
3. Invest in real-time data and evidence generation. For effective policy response to the
poverty consequences of the COVID-19 crisis, the importance of real-time evidence
cannot be overemphasized. As an example, the Power and Participation Research
Centre (PPRC) and BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD) teamed
up to launch a rapid-response telephone survey utilizing respondent t­elephone databases from earlier surveys on urban slums and rural poor (PPRC and BIGD 2020).
Despite concerns about phone access, literacy, and timing, the team was able to
commission a short survey to steer program response.
Economic inclusion programs are already using digital platforms for delivery; these
need to be further leveraged and expanded in the aftermath of COVID-19. An emerging
priority is to ensure social distancing in the delivery of high-touch components such
as training, coaching, savings groups, producer associations, and so on. Adaptations
to high-touch activities include shifting to digital platforms. The rapid diffusion of
new mobile and internet technologies presents an opportunity to deliver benefits
safely, avoid large gatherings, and contain the spread of the virus. Thirty percent of
­government-led programs already use digital technology to deliver at least one intervention, such as electronic payments, digital financial services, e-coaching, and e-training.

Challenges and Opportunities in Scaling Up
Economic Inclusion for COVID-19 Recovery
As economies focus on recovery efforts, it will be important to identify o
­ pportunities
for economic inclusion in emerging sectors, while being mindful of continued uncertainties. In most developing countries, there will likely be a nonlinear path from
response to recovery. With continuously changing epidemiology and transmission
patterns, there are frequent changes to containment measures in many developing
countries. This generates considerable uncertainty about the resumption of economic
activity and, hence, economic inclusion programming that is feasible and likely to have
the greatest impact for a post-COVID economic recovery. The mix will depend largely
on government priorities in sector support; which sectors are likely to start r­ ecovery
first and generate labor demand; which sectors may expand in light of changing
­medium-term needs (for example, frontline sectors like health care will likely expand);
35

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

what skills employers would look for in these sectors; and what value chains would
look like in these sectors. Lead actors will need to anticipate the implications of possible substantial changes to economic activity, such as continued disruptions, changes
in global supply chains, the decline of certain high-touch sectors, and the accelerating
pace of automation.
An added dimension to uncertainty is the policy direction on social d
­ istancing
and suppression that low-income countries are likely to follow. Barnett-Howell and
Mobarak (2020) suggest there are fewer benefits to social distancing and social
­suppression in low-income countries. This conclusion is driven by three factors. First,
developing countries have smaller proportions of elderly people to save via social
distancing compared to low-fertility rich nations. Second, while social distancing saves
lives in rich countries by flattening the curve of infections to reduce pressure on health
systems, delaying infections is not as useful in countries where health care systems are
already overwhelmed given the limited number of hospital beds and ventilators and
the fact that they are not accessible to most. Third, social distancing lowers disease risk
while limiting people’s economic opportunities. Poorer people are naturally less willing to make those economic sacrifices. They are also likely to have limited options for
working from home and may place relatively greater value on their livelihood concerns
compared to concerns about contracting coronavirus.

Leveraging Existing Government Programs to
Facilitate Livelihood Recovery
A likely consequence of COVID-19 will be the coalescence and persistence of large-scale
economic inclusion programs led by governments. Experience from previous global
crises suggests that the pathway to scaling is often politically driven, especially when
social cohesion is threatened. At present, there is considerable potential to accelerate
the scale-up of economic inclusion programming. In doing so, it will be essential for
governments to continue working in partnership with nongovernmental organizations
and other humanitarian organizations to implement programs on the ground.
Social safety net programs provide a key entry point for governments to scale up
economic inclusion efforts. With adaptive social protection systems forming the backbone of the first wave of response, the scale-up of economic inclusion programs is an
important complement for households and communities moving forward. Furthermore,
the engagement of community mechanisms is a critical driver of program ­delivery
with most programs using community structures. The engagement of community-­
based organizations will be vital during the recovery period as in-country movement
restrictions and the suspension of commercial transport hampers external partners
from accessing their programs in some areas. This is especially important in countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence and other vulnerability hotspots
(areas affected by locusts, droughts, and so forth), where the impact from COVID-19
will be especially high.
Scaling up economic inclusion programming will be faster in countries that
already have a credible base of economic inclusion programming. Fortunately, almost
80 percent of economic inclusion programs have a foothold in low- or lower-middle-­
income countries—the vast majority of which are found in Sub-Saharan Africa and
South Asia. At present, economic inclusion programming has a strong rural focus, and
adaptations to the urban context will need to be introduced for livelihood recovery,
as COVID-19 is currently impacting urban areas the hardest. Emerging innovations in
urban settings include small-scale municipal infrastructure and slum upgrading projects
to rapidly generate short-term employment opportunities for the urban poor through

labor-intensive public works. They include as well small grant or microcredit schemes
targeted to households for home improvements and informal home-based businesses.

CHAPTER 2
Moving to Scale: Political Realities and
Entry Points
KEY MESSAGES
The adoption and scale-up of economic inclusion programs hinges on political
acceptability. Political leadership and quality of evidence are two critical elements that
will determine the drive toward program scale-up.
Governments face strong challenges in determining target groups, often against
a backdrop of excess demand and tight fiscal constraints. The prioritization of any
target beneficiaries is influenced by policy priorities, poverty levels, economic profiles,
and community dynamics.
The success or failure of economic inclusion programs hinges on three programmatic
decisions: program objectives, financing, and institutional arrangements for delivery.
Design will vary depending on beneficiary income levels, the economic level of the
country, and context, such as fragility.
A new generation of economic inclusion programs is emerging building on existing
social safety nets (SSNs), livelihoods and jobs (L&J), and financial inclusion (FI)
interventions. These programs draw from diverse experiences in productive inclusion,
graduation, and community-driven development programs.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Testing and refining program objectives, design, and delivery is important in the
effort to scale. These help to increase the impact on different population segments and
vulnerable groups.
SSN programs can provide a strong foundation from which governments can scale
up economic inclusion efforts, especially in light of COVID-19. The first wave of
response to the pandemic is strengthening adaptive social protection systems, with
scaled-up economic inclusion programs being potentially important as a second wave
of response, especially for the informal sector, as governments restart their economies.
The role of political economy in economic inclusion programs is critical, and further
learning and research are required. Country experiences with program coordination in
and outside of government, transparency and accountability, and beneficiary outreach
will be especially relevant.

Introduction

C

hapter 2 explores the incentives, trade-offs, and strategic entry points in s­ caling
up economic inclusion programs at the country level. The chapter introduces
a political economy perspective considered as the historical processes, structural forces, and institutions shaping the direction of economic inclusion policies and
programs. Too often the discussion of economic inclusion and related programs focuses
on technical solutions for program design and implementation. This report devotes
significant attention to these technical details, which can be described as downstream
issues, but this chapter attempts to address upstream issues, such as what influences
the demand for inclusion, by drawing attention to the local and national considerations
that influence the decision to adopt these programs or not. With these political realities
in mind, the chapter discusses the three strategic entry points to scaling up originally
set forward in the report framework: social safety nets (SSNs), livelihoods and jobs
(L&J), and financial inclusion (FI).

Program Adoption and Scale-Up: Political Realities
The adoption and scale-up of economic inclusion programs hinges on political
­acceptability and involves trade-offs in program design and implementation because
political acceptability depends on how power relations among different groups influence ­decisions on social policy.1 Scale-up decisions are influenced by country context
(­especially as it relates to its institutions), the nature of the actors involved in the policy
arena, and their preferences and incentives with respect to economic inclusion policy.
There are also particular trade-offs in the distribution of resources across population
groups, whether regional or by demographic or wealth categories. However, it is worth
remembering that preferences and incentives can evolve over time, and country-specific
concerns about jobs, earnings, and opportunities are rapidly changing with each new
generation. Political transitions and large, covariate shocks, whether economic, climate
linked, or health related (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), can also shift preferences
and incentives for action.
Typically, there is strong support for economic inclusion across the political spectrum and among policy makers, with each having different institutional motivations.
Redistribution of wealth toward the poor can be seen as either a cost or an investment
and is often considered as part of a social contract. Despite divergent outlooks, most
policy makers find economic inclusion policies attractive, although for different reasons.
For some, these programs are seen to be central to promoting social justice by enabling
the poor to participate more actively in economic and social spheres of their communities. For others, concerns about dependency on social protection can also fuel greater
support for economic inclusion programs when they are seen, sometimes mistakenly, as
a mechanism for program exit.
Given this reality, the potential to scale up economic inclusion will depend on the
bargaining strength of the poor relative to the nonpoor, and on the support for such
programs among the nonpoor. The poorest households often face the greatest barriers
to collective action (and therefore may be less likely to engage in local government or in
community networks) and may also face disenfranchisement in the general political system
(Desai 2007). Women, in particular, face restrictions to political participation and rarely
play senior representation roles, making it difficult for them to shape policy. In this context,
political processes become important and a crucial determinant of program adoption.
In all cases, two aspects stand out as critical for scaling up economic inclusion
(or any social policy): one, a big idea that has already demonstrated an evidence-based
39

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

impact in a similar context (even if small scale), and two, a political inflection point,
typically accompanied by strong leadership with a vision and strategy for economic
inclusion at scale.
•• First, the role of evidence generation is essential in shifting preferences and bolstering political support. The scale-up of economic inclusion measures owes much
to the evidence demonstrated through pilot graduation schemes (Banerjee et al.
2015) as well as schemes that have shown the productive impacts of cash transfers (Alderman and Yemtsov 2013; Argent, Augsburg, and Rasul 2014; Banerjee
et al. 2015; Premand and del Ninno 2016) and those that have shown positive
impacts from complementary agriculture development and cash transfer programs
(FAO 2018; Slater et al. 2016; Soares et al. 2017; Tirivayi, Knowles, and Davis 2013;
Maldonado et al. 2016).
Chapter 5 of this report tackles the question of evidence and program impact in
detail and argues that a growing evidence base provides groundwork for considerable optimism. A review of 80 quantitative and qualitative evaluations in 37 countries shows that a broad range of economic inclusion programs have demonstrated
the promising—and potentially sustained—impact of a bundled set of interventions
relative to stand-alone efforts. The analysis points to a changing landscape, with
evidence now unfolding across a variety of government-led programs. This is important as it reflects the integration of inclusion efforts in broader antipoverty strategies
and brings into focus the potential to integrate beneficiaries in a wider system of
support. A new wave of evaluations looks ready to isolate the impact mechanisms
of economic inclusion programming at scale, across entry points, and for different
groups. They will also better highlight than previously the magnitude of program
impacts.
Evidence generation also comes in the form of peer-to-peer experience sharing and
knowledge exchange. For example, the integration of social protection objectives in a
rural development program in Ethiopia partly drew for inspiration on a 1990s study
tour by government officials of the Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme in
India (Lavers 2016). International development partners now play an active role in
providing technical assistance to government counterparts and encouraging such
peer-to-peer learning and knowledge exchange, which is important for agenda
setting.
•• Second, the decision to scale up an economic inclusion program often stems from a
political decision rather than being a purely technical response, especially in the wake
of major shocks. The series of case studies included in this report pinpoint a variety of political inflection points, each of which helped to make the case for scaling
up economic inclusion programs. In Peru, the Haku Wiñay program emerged from
a window of political opportunity that opened during the first years of President
Ollanta Humala’s administration. The administration favored a social program that
would not carry the perceived risks of promoting dependency. In the Sahel, political
economy drivers for the introduction of economic inclusion measures included fiscal
constraints, ongoing shocks, high population growth, and persistently deep poverty.
In Bihar, India, the Satat Jeevikoparjan Yojana program offered a preelection promise
of livelihood support to women affected by the outlawing of liquor selling. As elaborated in chapter 5, the experiences of Ethiopia (through the Productive Safety Net
Program, PSNP), Bangladesh, and Indonesia all emerge from crisis contexts in some
fashion. This has considerable policy implications for programming in the current
COVID-19 context, where economic inclusion programs may be expected to further
coalesce as part of medium-term recovery strategies.

Trade-Offs in Shaping Program Design and
Implementation
Many trade-offs in designing and implementing economic inclusion measures must be
negotiated. These come into play when selecting overall objectives, target groups, and
the components of bundled interventions. Chapters 4 to 6 discuss these trade-offs in
detail, but the following provides a summary introduction.
The cornerstone in designing any program is the choice of the objective. While the
overall goal of economic inclusion programs settles around the increase of income and
assets for program beneficiaries, program-specific objectives determine the path through
which this will be achieved. For example, there is a diversity of ­possible desired
outcomes for economic inclusion programs, including women’s empowerment, income
diversification, and resilience, as demonstrated by the 12 program objectives explored
in the Partnership for Economic Inclusion (PEI) Landscape Survey 2020, described
in chapter 3. Megatrends—such as population growth, shocks, forced displacement,
and climate change—are shaping government antipoverty policies and programs, and
raise complex decisions in terms of defining objectives for economic inclusion. Also
note, the choice of objective has important implications for the e­ ngagement of different
ministries and implementation partners.
Governments face challenging decisions in identifying target groups, often against
a backdrop of tight fiscal constraints. Political realities may require that programs cover
a broad range of population cohorts, in addition to (or even beyond) the poorest, often
to ensure popular support.
Decisions on program beneficiaries are shaped by several factors, including the
poverty and economic profile of the local context.
•• A first set of factors entails a country’s extent of poverty. For instance, programs in
low-income countries with vast levels of poverty commonly focus on the extreme
poor (see the glossary for definition). In lower-middle or middle-income countries,
economic inclusion is sometimes tailored to those with a certain level of assets or
incomes, whether poor or not, and at other times it is focused on remaining pockets
of the extreme poor. It is also increasingly common for economic inclusion programs
in contexts affected by displaced populations to prioritize the most vulnerable refugees, but also include a sizable number of host-community participants to acknowledge endemic poverty and to reduce community tensions. Across many programs,
handling excess demand will be a familiar challenge. The Haku Wiñay case study in
this report highlights how these challenges can also play to a program’s advantage.
The program determined that including better-off households in the community
would be a driver of successful livelihoods and income-generating activities. Betteroff households likely already had some ongoing business, had commercial links,
knew about the value chains, and could help shore up a critical volume of economic
activity to allow buyers and input providers, such as veterinary support, to come to
poor towns.
•• A second relevant factor is the extent to which personal characteristics of an individual shape program eligibility. For example, some programs prioritize those who
demonstrate a perceived “higher potential” to engage in entrepreneurial activities,
often through innovative psychometric testing. Yet without a degree of customization, this approach can lead to both inclusion and exclusion errors, giving additional
privilege to those who have had prior business experience and inadvertently discriminating against those who lacked such opportunity. It is also worth noting that in
most “graduation” programs, potential beneficiary “fast climbers” or “slow climbers” were not easily predicted by program staff, and past experience or inexperience
41

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

did not necessarily correlate to future success. Other economic i­nclusion programs,
such as SSN efforts, have adopted the same targeting criteria (and beneficiary lists)
as antipoverty programs. Once again, some customization is likely required, particularly in situations where the SSN is targeted to the poor and labor constrained. In
many programs, a key consideration is the identification of households with latent
and untapped economic potential. In this context, local knowledge and community
engagement can be critical to reduce errors and increase community buy-in.
•• A third set of factors used to shape program participation relates to household and
community dynamics. Social norms can restrict the extent to which participants
benefit from economic inclusion, and an understanding of household norms and
power dynamics could ensure programs are more effective. Programs may consider
a variety of factors, including expectations around child labor, the participation of
women in the labor market, and different marital structures: for example, polygamous versus monogamous households. At the local level, well-developed community structures can amplify the work of economic inclusion programming—in many
cases supporting program implementation. At the same time, several risks are noted.
Established norms for sharing wealth in mutual support networks can dilute the
expected impact of transfers from economic inclusion programs (Sabates-Wheeler,
Lind, and Hoddinott 2013). Similarly, the heavy involvement by some communities
in beneficiary selection can result in elite capture in highly stratified communities.

Critical Factors in the Failure or Success of Programs
Poor targeting and weak beneficiary selection mechanisms are one of the key factors
that undermine program performance and impact. Even where poor population groups
are the target, identifying them can be difficult. A common problem in many countries is the acquisition of reliable and up-to-date data on people’s income, which limits
the application of administrative targeting measures. Proxy identifiers for income,
such as assets, are commonly used, but among the bottom 60 percent of a population,
there is often little difference among people in their ownership of basic assets or land
or in housing conditions (Booysen et al. 2008). Consequently, this proxy method can
lead to misidentification of the very poorest, and here the engagement of the community in targeting may be important. Leveraging existing government systems for beneficiary selection (for example, social registries or community structures) can greatly
reduce cost and facilitate links with other programs. The capacity of implementers
to actually reach the target group with an intervention is another consideration. For
example, reaching nomadic people or people living in conflict-affected areas presents
special challenges.
Fine-tuned targeting and effective communication to the public about selection
priorities are critical. In some of the classic graduation-style pilots, only about half
the beneficiary households had daily per capita consumption below the international
extreme-poverty line (Banerjee et al. 2015). Although this was much larger than the
national share of the extreme poor in the respective country populations (which averaged about 19 percent), it meant that, in practice, these programs did not necessarily have the sharp focus on the extreme poor that was intended in the program design
(Kidd 2019; Kidd, Gelders, and Bailey-Athias 2017). In Sindh, Pakistan, the targeting approach was flawed, as the program relied on local influential leaders to identify
participants, an approach that led to elite capture and likely to the exclusion of the
poorest (Kabeer et al. 2012). In West Bengal, India, false rumors about religious conversions being effected through the program led to low take-up, particularly among eligible
Muslim households (Banerjee and Duflo 2011).
42

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

Ensuring financial commitment for a program is paramount and will involve
surmounting various fiscal pressures. Chapter 3 highlights a large share of government-­
led programs that are financed domestically or in combination with development
­partners. The incorporation of economic inclusion programs with national budget
lines is a further indicator of government ownership and commitment. Yet the cost of
economic inclusion programs (in isolation and relative terms) is a key debate. As elaborated in chapter 6, program costs will vary depending on context and the number of
program components. There is a significant set of knowledge gaps on how to optimize
costs, especially as part of a government system of support.
Fiscal pressure may impose design features that ultimately weaken the adequacy of
a program. For example, some government-led programs have expanded their coverage
but in the process made compromises on the generosity of lump-sum cash transfers.
For instance, the scaling-up of a pilot implemented by the Relief Society of Tigray in
Ethiopia led to an initial reduction in the cash grant in order to maintain parity among
different poverty reduction programs (Sheldon 2016).
The early exit of program beneficiaries from a safety net program is an example of
a trade-off between technical and political interests, given fiscal constraints. Under the
PSNP, the government of Ethiopia imposed fairly strict exit criteria, which led to the
early exit of program beneficiaries. Between 2009 and 2011, intensified political pressure
led to 17 percent of registered households being classified as having met the program’s
graduation criteria. However, in 2010, less than 5 percent of surveyed communities
reported graduation rates above 10 percent and nearly half the surveyed communities
reported no graduation (Berhane et al. 2011).
Exiting successfully is further complicated by the challenge of capturing household readiness to move to the next stage of policy support. In Bangladesh’s Chars
Livelihoods Program, a sensitivity analysis found that the share of households considered to have met the criteria for economic inclusion changed dramatically depending on
the threshold, ranging from 65 percent having achieved 7 (out of 10) criteria, 37 percent
having achieved 8 (out of 10) criteria, and only 2 percent having achieved all 10 criteria
(Pritchard, Kenward, and Hannan 2015).
Multidimensional programs require strong intra- and interinstitutional coordination. Achieving interinstitutional cooperation is a challenging task due to the existence
of institutional rigidities and inertia, prioritization of individual over collective objectives, and lack of incentives to adequately encourage joint work (World Bank 2020).
The challenge is further compounded in low-capacity settings. Typically, this challenge is seen with regard to the engagement of ministries with responsibility for social
protection and agriculture. Agricultural and social protection policies originate from
different disciplines and are often viewed as parallel policies implemented by different
authorities that compete for financial resources (Tirivayi, Knowles, and Davis 2013).
While some examples exist regarding effective coordination—for example, in Rwanda,
Bangladesh, and Ethiopia—these are the exception rather than the norm, and several
other country experiences highlight the political constraints that limit coordination.
There are several opportunities to advance coordination and synergy across government agencies. In some instances, programs have developed political and interagency
agreements with a clear definition of the expected value added from this collaboration.
In Latin America, for example, countries have opted for fostering collaboration among
ministries or agencies, usually under the form of coordination bodies, to facilitate interaction among institutions and levels of governments (for example, in Argentina, Chile,
and Mexico). Others have decided to centralize the different components under the
same organization (Peru). Experience also suggests that potential synergies could be
maximized by sharing knowledge, understanding potential constraints, or developing a
systems approach that promotes the cross-sectoral coordination or integration of social
protection with agriculture (Tirivayi, Knowles, and Davis 2013).

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

As programs scale up, careful transparency and accountability measures become
paramount to ensuring reduced political bias. To this end, economic i­nclusion
programs at scale can take advantage of established governance mechanisms in a
country, as well as actively develop measures to promote accountability and c­ itizen
engagement in their own programs; for example:
•• In Egypt, economic inclusion services and activities currently under design seek to
capitalize on sector mechanisms that are already in place, including social accountability committees at the village level, performance audits, and security.
•• In Malawi, ongoing implementation of the Community Savings and Investment
Promotion program is aided by close collaboration with the Anti-Corruption Bureau.
Under a new phase of program support in Malawi, new initiatives are being devised,
including sensitization and awareness-­raising in targeted departments and beneficiary communities to prevent misuse of project resources, enhanced engagement of
citizens and stakeholders, and enforcement through close supervision.
•• In Panama, the Red de Oportunidades program follows the existing laws and procedures for consultation and community involvement and outreach of the indigenous
territories. The Panamanian government also has a redress and complaint mechanism for all its programs, as well as a telephone line for complaints.

Entry Points to Scale
As outlined in chapter 1, the PEI Landscape Survey 2020 revealed three entry points on
which economic inclusion programs are built. Figure 2.1 presents the distribution of
these entry points, measured as percentages of all programs reviewed in the survey. The
dominant entry points for programs overall center on L&J (63 percent), closely followed
by SSN (35 percent). Strikingly, among government-led programs the entry points
appear to even out, with the proportion of L&J to SSN programs being nearly 1:1 as
compared to 3:1 among nongovernment-led programs. The survey results for this report
show 45 percent of government-led economic inclusion programs build e­ xplicitly on
SSN interventions, covering close to 58 percent of total economic ­inclusion beneficiaries

featured in the sample.2 Importantly, most programs also have a secondary entry point
that balances the emphasis of the focus of an intervention (figure 2.2).
The entry points reinforce evolving trends in country-level social protection and
jobs policy. As social protection coverage for the extreme poor expands globally, there
is growing interest in how these investments—especially noncontributory SSNs—can
connect with broader development processes and ultimately inform a broader agenda
for the poor, especially in the informal sector. While this provides an anchor to much
of the analysis in this report, it is important to recognize how experiences related to
­graduation programs inform this discussion (see box 2.1).

Entry Point 1: Social Safety Nets
SSNs have been found to strengthen equity, resilience, and opportunity, but alone they
may be insufficient to transform income and asset levels. A wide body of evidence
shows that SSN programs, especially in low-income countries, reach extremely poor
populations and reduce household poverty and inequality. While SSN coverage and
expenditure may be relatively modest compared to health and education, SSNs reach
about one-fifth of all households in low-income countries and represent approximately
one quarter of the income of the poorest.
Cash transfers improve cognitive development and human capital and tend to be
spent overwhelmingly on improved food consumption, diversified diets, and productive
items. Cash transfers are also economic multipliers, including their effect as generators
of “effective demand” among low-income beneficiaries, which has the net effect of raising their disposable income by around 26 percent. One study has found that for every
dollar transferred this way, between $1.27 and $2.52 is generated in local economies
(Handa et al. 2017).
However, an expanding evidence base shows that provision of cash alone may fall
short in achieving long-term, second-order impacts (Attah et al. 2016; Bastagli et al. 2016;
Roelen et al. 2017; Beegle et al. 2018). As countries expand the coverage and financing
of this form of social protection, the terms social safety net–plus (SSN-plus) or cash-plus

BOX 2.1

Building on and Graduating from the Graduation Approach

Economic inclusion programs, as reflected in this report, build on the worldwide
­experience of graduation-style programs, which were initiated by BRAC in Bangladesh
and promoted globally by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), the Ford
Foundation, and others.
First, the report recognizes the demonstration effect of a coordinated and
­time-bound package of interventions for poor households as evidenced in the
literature (Banerjee et al. 2015).
Second, it draws on the vast country experiences of graduation programs in
more than 40 countries, including the innovations demonstrated in areas such as
financial inclusion, livelihoods, coaching, and empowerment.
Third, it acknowledges the importance of partnership and collaboration in a
­carefully sequenced and multisectoral approach.
Graduation as a concept has evolved since the approach was first devised in 2002,
leaving it open to varying interpretations as to what programs aspire to achieve. That
is, some programs aim for graduation from poverty in general, others aim for graduation from social protection, while still others are designed to graduate households into
a social protection program or sustainable livelihoods. These diverse purposes have
helped fuel sometimes polarizing discussion among its proponents and detractors. For
many, the term graduation is itself highly problematic, and the space left for constructive debate is too often very narrow. For others, the term remains a steadfast part of
program communications and ethos. Fundamentally, the decisions on how programs
are communicated are best brokered at the country level and will be informed by the
direction set by government.
Economic inclusion stands as a distinct policy space as part of a broader social policy
continuum. It adheres to the core idea of a set of bundled interventions already found
in graduation programs. However, it links the household and local-economy aspects of
programming with broader sector policies and strategies and seeks to ensure stronger levels of integration across households, communities, and mesolevel interventions. Economic inclusion does not necessarily include any reference to an arbitrary
beneficiary cut-off; the implications for beneficiaries after the time-bound interventions
conclude are typically defined at the national level.
A defining and distinguishing feature of many economic inclusion programs is the
close connection and integration with national SSN systems. The framework in this
report illustrates how economic inclusion is integrated in national social protection and antipoverty programs. These approaches are clearly situated at the heart
of the government-led development landscape. Embedding economic inclusion
in government is a prerequisite for moving to scale and also reflects the value of
government leadership, national capacities, and sustainability.

are gaining prominence, the plus indicating the potential to complement cash with
additional inputs, service components, or links to external services. Economic inclusion
is a key driver of the SSN agenda, showing particular promise to strengthen program
impacts, but also with the reality of increased costs and complexity.
The first policy arena where SSNs and economic inclusion programs intersect is in
rural areas, where a large body of recent programming and associated research shows
strong potential synergies between the SSNs and agriculture at both the household and
local-economy levels. SSN programs frequently reach a target group of the population
engaged in low-productivity employment, particularly in agriculture and household
enterprises. Extensive research shows that stronger coherence between social protection
measures and agricultural interventions can facilitate productive inclusion, improved
risk-management capacities, and increased agricultural productivity (Kagin et al. 2019;
Gavrilovic et al. 2016; Pace et al. 2018). Similarly, a meta-analysis of 27 programs in
Africa concluded that a multidimensional approach to poverty reduction would better
advance productive inclusion than a stand-alone SSN and that integration of complementary interventions would likely boost productive and employment outcomes
(Ralston, Andrews, and Hsiao 2017).
Economic inclusion programs have a strong potential to support SSN beneficiaries
facing fragility, conflict, or economic reforms. The emerging agenda around “­adaptive
safety nets” focuses this discussion in stronger terms (Bowen et al. 2020). For example,
the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program, discussed in the first case study, includes
a basic package of time-bound measures, with several design variations being tested
through a robust impact evaluation. SSNs also provide a pathway for ­integrated programming in support of economic reforms. For example, as Egypt undertakes strong economic
and social reforms, the government has invested in social ­mitigation measures to cushion
the most vulnerable from adverse impacts. Egypt’s Forsa (Opportunity) initiative provides
skill development or asset transfers to households enrolled in the government-implemented Takaful and Karama cash transfer program. This program covers 3.1 million
households in Egypt, 74 percent of them female. Finally, the intersection between
economic inclusion and fragility and conflict-affected situations is also noteworthy.
Thirty percent of the SSN programs surveyed for this report operate in fragile and
conflict-affected situations. For example, Iraq is considering economic inclusion measures
in response to widespread displacement, increased poverty and vulnerability, and high
unemployment, especially among youths, women, and host communities.
Where demand for labor is low, public works or cash-for-work programs may
feature prominently in an SSN-plus approach. Public works programs are generally
viewed as social SSN instruments and are used in diverse contexts across both low- and
middle-income countries. Their dual objectives are to provide temporary employment
while also generating or maintaining labor-intensive infrastructure projects and social
services. Of the SSN programs surveyed for this report, roughly a third include a public
works component, of which the considerable majority are in Africa. In Ethiopia, for
example, the PSNP provides regular cash or food transfers to 8 million people, with capable beneficiaries undertaking public works, such as landscape restoration, small-scale
irrigation, social infrastructures, and agroforestry. Approximately 10 percent of PSNP
beneficiaries participate in a combination of training and receipt of a livelihood grant.
Public works programs are also active in fragile and conflict affected situations,
where they are increasingly used to serve at-risk populations.
•• In Cameroon, for instance, refugees have been integrated into the national SSN
program, with 44,500 nationals and 8,500 refugees expected to undertake public
works activities that benefit both the host communities and the refugees.

•• In the Democratic Republic of Congo, public works are being combined with training
and savings to improve the prospects of long-term poverty reduction among populations affected by violent conflict.
There is heightened focus on the capacity of SSN programs to make links and referrals, which has important implications for economic inclusion programs. Referrals to
services is increasingly considered an imperative for tackling the various constraints
of the poorest and most vulnerable households (Roelen et al. 2017). In Chile, the
Chile Solidario scheme included cash transfers, monetary subsidies, psychosocial
support, and preferential access to social programs, supported by a system of case
management and referrals. Social workers played a crucial intermediary role, providing information and guidance to ensure that beneficiaries had access to programs and
services (Roelen et al. 2017). In 2016, Rwanda commenced implementation of the
Minimum Package to Support Graduation, a defined package of core social protection
services and complementary interventions to strengthen the livelihoods and resilience of extremely poor and vulnerable households. It leveraged social welfare caseworker support to promote social and economic inclusion of the most vulnerable
households. Initial piloting in Rwanda shows that caseworkers have usefully served as
role models by providing basic advice on key life issues and links to support resources;
both are regarded as critical to building households’ confidence and motivation.
Programs that target people with disabilities also focus more than other programs on
wage facilitation to help participants build regular streams of income and also to foster
greater self-confidence and challenge societal biases. Further exploration of work with
people with disabilities can be found in chapter 3.
There is promising evidence that SSNs can facilitate gender equality and women’s
empowerment (Peterman et al. 2019). Cash transfers provide immediate and tangible support, are often targeted directly at women, and can help break open traditional
power dynamics that prevent women from fulfilling their potential. That said, transformative effects are not ensured, and transferring benefits directly to women does not
necessarily lead to changed power dynamics or empowerment. Contextually appropriate program design is critical, and this is discussed at length in this report’s spotlight 2,
“Promoting Women’s Empowerment through Economic Inclusion.”
Despite the clear potential for harnessing the links between SSNs and economic
inclusion, there are a number of important ongoing debates:
•• Cash transfers alone are a productive investment. There is a strong political appeal
in layering economic inclusion measures over SSN programs, which continue to
expand in their coverage. Some stakeholders are uncertain about the financial
sustainability of wide-scale SSN programs, for instance, in low-income countries,
making more narrowly targeted inclusion programs more politically appealing.
However, this should not be perceived as meaning that cash alone is not a productive investment. As noted, there is clear evidence of the multiplier effects of cash.
•• Economic inclusion is not a replacement for cash transfers. The emerging positive evidence on economic inclusion and the expanding number of corresponding
programs should not be viewed as suggesting that there is no longer a role for cash
transfers. Cash transfers continue to have a broad range of strong economic and
social impacts, including outcomes related to cognitive development, schooling,
and health. Cash transfers also play an important role where households are labor
constrained, and they have very high coverage in many countries, usually much
greater than economic inclusion programs can currently achieve. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that large cash transfers produce substantial benefits across
a wide range of impacts, including areas traditionally served by other approaches.
In Rwanda, for example, the results of an integrated nutrition and water supply,
48

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

sanitation, and hygiene program were compared with those of a program that
transferred an equivalent quantity of unconditional cash. The integrated program
improved savings, whereas the cost-equivalent cash transfer boosted productive asset
investment and allowed households to pay down debt. A much larger cash transfer
(of more than $500 per household) improved savings, assets, and a wide range of
consumption measures, including dietary diversity (McIntosh and Zeitlin 2018).
•• Program delivery systems in social protection have a strong potential to amplify the
design and implementation of economic inclusion. Advances in social registry and
payment systems present opportunities to improve the impact of economic inclusion
programs and are further discussed in chapters 3, 4, and 6. Broad delivery systems
(for example, social registries) are considered in chapter 3, although they are also
related to elements discussed under ”Entry Point 3: Financial Inclusion.”

Entry Point 2: Livelihoods and Jobs
L&J strategies for the poorest are shaped by thinking on sustainable livelihoods and,
more recently, on the changing nature of work. Chambers and Conway (1992) popularized widespread consideration of the sustainable livelihoods approach, defined as
a situation where a “livelihood … can cope with and recover from the stresses and
shocks and maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets both now and in the future
without undermining the natural resource base.” Over the years, sustainable livelihood
approaches have informed a variety of discussions on risk management (for e­ xample,
Jorgensen and Siegel 2019), graduation models (Devereux and Sabates-Wheeler 2015),
community-driven development (Goldman 2010), and local economic development.
In recent years, discussions on sustainable livelihoods have evolved against the backdrop of transforming contexts and aspirations of individuals. The nature of labor market
participation and of employment and social protection for the poor have all shifted
rapidly, and with that the landscape for economic inclusion is also evolving.
While economic transformation will be the main driver of productivity growth and
poverty reduction, it is not automatically inclusive and does not always translate into
improvements in household living standards among the poorest (Ravallion, Jolliffe,
and Margitic 2018). The expansion of productive and decent work is vital in allowing economies to grow and diversify (World Bank 2019). Productive jobs—in agriculture, in nonfarm household enterprises, and in the modern wage sector—are the key to
higher earnings as well as to more stable, less vulnerable livelihoods (Filmer and Fox
2014). An estimated 80 percent of labor productivity growth in low-income countries
comes from the reallocation of labor from lower productivity agriculture into relatively
higher productivity services and industry. For a considerable cohort of the population,
other labor market interventions may be critical in facilitating pathways to better jobs,
typically through improved productivity, movement from rural to urban regions, sector
and occupational changes, and transitions to waged jobs. However, such pathways
may be less available for the poorest populations, especially in rural settings, and the
effectiveness of active labor market programs also remains a matter of ongoing debate
(McKenzie 2017). The extreme poor and vulnerable (for example, poor households
in rural or urban areas, and the poorest youth, refugees, and women) face enormous
constraints to climbing out of poverty alone and rely on a broader functioning ecosystem and support, coupled with complementary macro-level policies.
An increasing number of L&J programs focus on removing barriers that keep the
extreme poor and vulnerable from participating in the local economy and in higher
productivity jobs. An adequate supply of jobs is the foundation of sustained and growing prosperity, inclusion, and social cohesion (ILO n.d.). In many countries, including
49

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

those in Sub-Saharan Africa, jobs have broader importance than the income they
provide. Jobs can convey identity, status, and self-confidence and can contribute to an
individual’s overall life satisfaction. Furthermore, jobs contribute to social cohesion by
shaping identities and the ways individuals relate to one another and by connecting
people to one another through networks (Filmer and Fox 2014).
In light of the Arab Spring and other recent events, policy makers, especially in
Sub-Saharan Africa, are placing a high priority on the creation of sustainable, productive youth employment. Africa’s growing labor force represents an enormous demographic dividend, particularly now, when populations in much of the world are aging
rapidly (Banerji et al. 2014). Youth unemployment stems from constraints to labor
supply (human capital, such as in education, skills, and networks) and labor demand
(business environment, including access to finance, infrastructure, technology, markets,
and so forth). Many young people lack the means, skills, knowledge, or connections
to translate their education into productive employment. Young women, in particular,
may be constrained by occupational segregation, social norms, or the fear of sexual
harassment (Scarpari and Clay 2020). L&J interventions can reduce those obstacles to
productivity, leading to better employment prospects for youth.
Targeted self-employment programs for youth groups show promise, but they also
raise questions as to the appropriate profile for entrepreneurship. Recent years have
seen a growing focus on using large cash grants in youth entrepreneurship programs.
Whereas traditional SSN interventions typically focus on consumption and human
capital, these programs seek to improve employment opportunities for youths. To date
they have had differing results. The Youth Opportunities Program in Uganda, which
provides a one-time cash grant of approximately $382 per participant, has shown positive outcomes, including a 57 percent increase in business assets and 38 percent higher
earnings (Blattman et al. 2013). It is important to highlight, however, that the positive
impacts of this program are temporary and largely disappear over time (Blattman, Fiala,
and Martinez 2019). Other programs in Uganda have had encouraging results with a
focus on young women (Blattman et al. 2013), but similar innovations in Liberia and
Sri Lanka have had varying results (Blattman, Jamison, and Sheridan 2016; de Mel,
McKenzie, and Woodruff 2013).
In low-income contexts, the availability of wage-paying jobs is often low, leaving
many workers relying on informal markets to survive—a situation with stark implications for the extreme poor and vulnerable. Many workers in the informal sector lack
the skills, technologies, and access to basic services to effectively undertake productive economic activities. Low-income countries are particularly characterized by a
high concentration of employment in low-productivity occupations in agriculture and
nonagricultural self-employment, with only a very thin and slow-growing formal sector.
Income from informal jobs can be volatile, with limited social protection when circumstances result in a loss of income. In these contexts, then, there is a large population for
whom productive work is simply unavailable and who are excluded from formal social
protection systems.
As economic inclusion programs typically target poor or developing economies
with a sizeable informal sector, there is tremendous potential for economic inclusion
programs to unlock opportunities for greater market access and productive work. In
Sub-Saharan Africa, almost 80 percent of the workforce work in the informal sector
(Filmer and Fox 2014). Informal jobs remain a significant source of employment in lowand lower-middle-income countries (Merotto, Weber, and Aterido 2018). Furthermore,
given evidence that formalization has limited effectiveness in increasing incomes, the
employment challenge is therefore not just to create jobs in the formal sector but to
increase the productivity of those who are in the informal sector (Filmer and Fox 2014).
Economic inclusion programs can support informal operators to become more productive and profitable through business training and market access interventions as well as
50

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

household-level social protection measures that go beyond the poor and include low-­
income informal workers.
A key question is how to make economic inclusion of the poor—especially the rural
poor—a core element of employment approaches and policies. Employment p
­ olicies often
lack a rural-poverty lens, focusing instead on unemployment, on urban areas, or on the
formal sectors. Meanwhile, rural poverty reduction efforts have traditionally focused on
supporting primary producers, particularly income-generation activities for smallholder
farmers, based on the assumption that bottom-up improvements on the supply side will
jump-start rural development and eliminate poverty (Mueller and Chan 2015).
Agriculture provides the most immediate means of generating income and employment for the rural poor, especially for large numbers of young people. In Sub-Saharan
Africa, agriculture engages more than 70 percent of the labor force in low-income
countries (Filmer and Fox 2014). However, the gains from agricultural programs such
as those based on microcredit, infrastructure, irrigation, extension, and input technology are often unevenly shared among the poorest populations (Tirivayi, Knowles, and
Davis 2013). Relatively little attention has been paid to raising productivity in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment where the poor work, although recent efforts
to link agriculture and social protection for the poorest have shown promise to address
a variety of production and consumption constraints (Kagin et al. 2019; Gavrilovic et al.
2016; Pace et al. 2018). L&J programs can help farmworkers increase their productivity through the provision of modern agricultural inputs, improvements in infrastructure
(transport, electricity, and irrigation), access to regional markets, and sector-specific
training. If workers can gain access to these resources and use them in conjunction
with strategies to make agriculture more productive, the results could be transformative
for livelihoods and economic growth.
An emerging opportunity is creating links with value chain development, an
approach that addresses the constraints of different actors in a value chain (input
providers, producers, processors, and distributors) to reduce transaction costs and boost
efficiency. In Côte d’Ivoire, a pilot program to integrate economic inclusion into the rice
value chain is applying an explicit jobs lens by contracting buyers to purchase rice from
smallholder farmers (the program’s beneficiaries). Integrating value chain development with economic inclusion may help achieve sustainability, cost-­effectiveness, and
scalability while improving employment for the most vulnerable. However, connecting
vulnerable groups to growing markets also requires sufficient demand for labor, goods,
and/or services in a mature and well-functioning value chain. Making this succeed
requires a tailored support package designed with an in-depth understanding of the
value chain and the specific constraints that vulnerable groups face in accessing jobs
and earning opportunities.
Despite a strong set of opportunities to leverage L&J interventions, several challenges persist:
•• A key challenge, as shown by emerging evidence, is that program beneficiaries—or
any own-account worker—may not have the appropriate profile to become successful entrepreneurs. While this may indicate the need for improved selection criteria
based on personality traits, it also suggests many youths would be better off in wage
employment rather than self-employment. With high population growth creating a
huge youth bulge in the coming decades, the implications for cost-effective programming are substantial.
•• Successful approaches may require the combination of jobs, livelihood, and safety
net expertise. One such intervention is through public works programs. Increasingly,
public works are designed to enhance employability by combining work experience
with other activation measures, such as training. For the workers, these programs
establish a minimum income and give them work experience that improves their
51

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

future employability. Existing public works programs are focused mainly on public
infrastructure, such as the construction and maintenance of water and waste
management systems, electricity and gas systems, roads, schools, and hospitals.
Better community infrastructure can increase market output, lower transaction costs,
and improve market access, thereby raising the profitability of small producers and
enterprises. It is important to note that the impacts of public works programs are
heavily debated and require a great deal of capacity. While public works programs
deliver critical economic benefits for the communities in the short term, there is
little evidence of sustained impact of economic welfare outcomes in the long run
(Mvukiyehe 2018). Economic inclusion programs offer potential to redesign these
programs through a bundling of additional interventions, such as capital infusion,
training, and coaching.
•• Limited labor demand often spurs urbanization and migration, which require
­adaptation of economic inclusion interventions. In many countries, jobs are simply
not available where most people live, triggering temporary or permanent migration. There is often a tension between economic inclusion programs that try to
create work in the same location as poor households and programs that seek to
reduce barriers to safe migration. For many vulnerable people, internal migration
may be a preferable alternative for boosting their income and earnings compared to
participating in economic inclusion practices, much less remaining self-employed in
agriculture. Moreover, the growth of financial services and mobile telecommunications has facilitated the remittance of income to rural areas. The growth of internal
migration, particularly to urban areas, will likely continue as an important strategy to stabilize household incomes. However, the broader impacts of young people
migrating to urban settings require further research and analysis, given anecdotal
evidence that they may often end up in exploitive conditions.

Entry Point 3: Financial Inclusion
Financial inclusion can amplify the movement of economic inclusion to scale. An
important entry point for improving economic inclusion is through direct access to
financial services, including credit, savings, insurance, and e-payments or mobile
money. Methods for expanding financial inclusion have evolved considerably over
recent decades, starting with microfinance institutions in the 1990s that began offering
small loans to families and microbusinesses as pathways out of poverty. That approach
has been followed by a proliferation of financial services that demonstrate how products beyond loans can empower poor people. More recently, digital services have
lowered the cost of connecting excluded groups to the formal financial system, and
emerging themes include technologies and business models such as pay-as-you-go asset
finance and fintech. The scope of available services is much greater than in the past.
Having access to formal banking services and other financial institutions enables
women to invest in the growth and development of their businesses and to manage
their earnings and savings. As their personal store of funds grows, women can become
less dependent on a husband’s earnings and less subject to their control, able to make
decisions for themselves about where and how to spend their money. This autonomy can also extend beyond finances to decision-making in other domains, such as
marriage, leisure time, and contraceptive use (Aker et al. 2016; Bandiera et al. 2013;
de Brauw et al. 2014; Field et al. 2016; Holloway, Niazi, and Rouse 2017; Pitt, Khandker,
and Cartwright 2006; Schuler and Hashemi 1994; Suri and Jack 2016). For example,
in Kenya the BOMA Project supports ultrapoor women through business and savings
groups and a digital financial product. Participants saw substantial increases in their
52

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

income and savings, leading to increased household decision-making power and
increased expenditures on education and nutrition. However, BOMA also observed
that illiteracy, innumeracy, and unfamiliarity with technology were barriers to full
uptake of the digital product. BOMA’s experience highlights the need for simpler tools
designed thoughtfully for the target population, as well as time for participants to learn
to use them.
The spread of government-to-person (G2P) payments has the potential to improve
the effectiveness of core cash transfer payments as well as improve financial services
such as microloans, savings, and local market information. A shift to electronic
payments, for example, can facilitate the link to FI for those previously unbanked. In
many countries, policy makers and donors are exploring the case for drawing people
into the formal banking system using social protection payments as the “on ramp,”
especially when the payments are made to bank accounts or electronically. The Better
Than Cash Alliance promotes links between social protection and financial inclusion
by advocating that G2P payments shift from cash to electronic payments. Electronic
payment can provide a pathway to a broader range of financial services, is generally
safer (especially for women and girls), and is more efficient for low-income people.
The literature suggests several critical elements that need to be in place for effective digital G2P transfers, including (1) institutional arrangements and coordination
between government agencies and the financial sector, (2) a finance and banking
regulatory framework to enable secure digital payments and mobile money options,
(3) mobile and broadband infrastructure, (4) identification and robust know-your-customer criteria, and (5) payment system interoperability.
Despite considerable potential in the scale-up of FI responses, several challenges
remain:
•• Low-income and vulnerable target population groups still tend to be the most
excluded from financial services. This exclusion is due to several underlying
constraints, including social norms and cognitive and noncognitive skills. The
increasing recognition of this exclusion has led to renewed attention on the potential
for financial services to improve resilience and opportunities (El-Zoghbi, Holle, and
Soursourian 2019; Ruiz 2013; Schaner and Das 2016). There has also been a realization that financial inclusion alone will not achieve the desired outcomes, and that
additional interventions for the poorest need to be included (Escudero et al. 2019;
Khandker, Khalily, and Samad 2016; Soares et al. 2017).
•• Inconsistent access to different financial services is an ongoing challenge facing
the poor, particularly specific cohorts such as women and youth. Having access to
low-cost credit is vitally important for poor households to reduce their debt-servicing
costs and for microentrepreneurs to grow their businesses. Simple design tweaks
may promote improved access and outcomes for credit. Research suggests that
borrowers who had started a business before gaining access to microcredit are more
likely to see significant benefits from taking out loans, whereas those who went into
business only after the introduction of microcredit are less likely to see any benefits (Banerjee et al. 2017; Meager 2019). The policy implication is one that naturally favors high-potential entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, other financial products, such
as index, crop, or livestock insurance, while important, may be out of reach to the
poorest and challenging to scale. A key policy implication is to ensure better customization of financial services, including program tweaks to make products more beneficial to population segments.
•• Experiences in a range of countries suggest that apart from improving account ownership, G2P transfers are not leading to higher account usage or increased uptake of
formal financial products. Evaluations and focus group discussions among SSN
53

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

beneficiaries in Kenya, Colombia, and Pakistan have found little evidence of beneficiaries using bank accounts or financial services (Weingärtner et al. 2019; Stuart
2016). A 2014 study of the experience of digital transfers in Haiti, Kenya, the
Philippines, and Uganda found that insufficient knowledge about program rules and
payment methods, inconsistent and delayed payments, and unclear communication about ways to redress grievances reduced trust among beneficiaries and undermined financial inclusion objectives (Zimmerman, Bohling, and Parker 2014). It is
also possible that G2P payments could actively undermine the welfare of beneficiaries. In South Africa, the firm delivering social cash transfers digitally marketed
loans to beneficiaries using the payments as collateral, contributing to overindebtedness and rapidly declining account balances due to automatic premium payments
(Torkelson 2020).

Future Directions
The refinement of program objectives and definition of target groups remain key issues
in scaling up economic inclusion programs. While the overall goal of economic inclusion programs settles around the increase of income and assets for program beneficiaries, program-specific objectives determine the direction through which this will be
achieved. In moving to scale, economic inclusion programs show considerable flexibility in accommodating diverse needs and priorities. Decisions on program beneficiaries
take into account poverty levels, economic profiles, and dynamics at the community and local economy levels. Moving forward, it will be important to test and refine
economic inclusion program design and delivery to increase programs’ impact on
specific population segments and vulnerable groups.
SSN programs provide a premier backbone for governments to scale economic
inclusion efforts—especially in the COVID-19 context. With adaptive social protection
systems forming the foundation of the first wave of COVID-19 response, the scale-up
of economic inclusion programs is an important feature of the medium-to-longer-term
response as governments seek to restart their economies, especially in the informal
sector. The role of economic inclusion building on SSNs will be critical in strengthening
equity, resilience, and opportunity for households and communities.
Greater attention and resources are needed to support learning on the political
economy of economic inclusion. The adoption and scale-up of economic inclusion
programs hinges on political acceptability and involves trade-offs in program design
and implementation. The sharing of evidence, peer-to-peer learning, and cross-country information will be important factors in the scale-up of programs. Country experiences linked to program coordination in and outside of government, transparency and
accountability, and beneficiary outreach will be especially relevant across this learning
agenda. Furthermore, a new wave of evaluations looks set to help isolate the mechanisms of the impact of economic inclusion programming at scale across entry points
and for different groups.

Notes
1. We draw on a political settlements approach to examine the political economy of economic

inclusion policy and programming. See the World Development Report 2017 (World Bank 2017)
for a framework. This framework has been used to examine the political economy of social
protection in Africa (Hickey et al. 2019) and Asia and the Pacific (O’Keefe et al. forthcoming).
2. Consistent with the approach in chapter 3, this excludes data from JEEViKA, in Bihar, India,
which is an outlier program in the overall sample.

CHAPTER 3
A Surge in Economic Inclusion
Programming Worldwide
KEY MESSAGES
The Partnership for Economic Inclusion (PEI) Landscape Survey 2020 provides a snapshot of economic inclusion programs around the world based on 219 programs reaching
over 90 million beneficiaries. Economic growth is driven by governments in low-income
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. These estimates are conservative and
represent an initial baseline.
Economic inclusion programs are implemented in a variety of contexts and geographies and among different target groups. Rural residents, women, and specific vulnerable groups are clear priorities.
Economic inclusion programs provide an integrated package of interventions. They
typically include five or more components and most commonly feature transfers, skills
training, coaching, market links, and access to financial services.
Existing cash transfer programs show strong potential to support program scale-up.
Cash transfers are a driving component across programs. There is growing attention on the
structure of cash payments, for example, continuous, less regular, or one-off grant transfers.
Data presented in this chapter are available at www.peiglobal.org, which allows
programs to upload, update, and use data as a global public good.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
A strong focus on youth is emerging. Because of young peoples’ high levels of underemployment and uncertain pathways to formal jobs, economic inclusion programs will
play an important development role, but programs need to adapt to ensure effective
links to complementary services.
Coaching and entrepreneurial support need to be strengthened and streamlined.
Innovations in program delivery are emerging, including digital options, self-help
groups, and peer-to-peer learning networks.
Economic inclusion programs in fragile settings are poised to grow further, necessitating a better understanding of operational models. Good practices in linking
economic inclusion to humanitarian interventions and facilitating market links in fragile
settings need to be documented.
Multidimensional economic inclusion programs are well placed to help people with
disabilities overcome some of the challenges they face in increasing their economic
opportunities. The body of knowledge on adapting program design and delivery to
increase outcomes for people with disabilities is growing.

A Snapshot in Time

A

n unprecedented surge in economic inclusion programming is occurring worldwide. The Partnership for Economic Inclusion (PEI) Landscape Survey 2020
features data and information covering approximately 20 million households,
benefiting nearly 92 million individuals, either directly or indirectly. Forty-one new
programs are in the planning stages in 12 countries. Nearly half of all programs worldwide (49 percent) are government led, as governments have been adopting and expanding them to reach the poorest populations. Moreover, the existing government-led
programs are far larger than the nongovernment-led programs, covering nearly
90 percent of beneficiaries across all the programs featured in this report. All of this
strongly suggests that there is considerable potential for beneficiary numbers to grow.
This chapter presents a snapshot of current economic inclusion programming
under way and establishes a baseline with data from a survey conducted by PEI
between November 2019 and May 2020. Although it is difficult to capture the
universe of economic inclusion programming, this survey was comprehensive in
scope: the data come from 219 programs in 75 countries. Forty-two percent of the
programs surveyed are being supported by the World Bank in 53 countries. The full
2020 sample is analyzed in this chapter, and chapter 4 focuses on government-led
programs only. The data collected through PEI’s Landscape Survey 2020 is publicly
available through an online dashboard at http://peiglobal.org, which provides easy
access to, and encourages further engagement with, the data. Box 3.1 provides more
detail on the survey’s scope and methods.

BOX 3.1

Partnership for Economic Inclusion Landscape Survey 2020

To map the universe of economic inclusion programs, the study underlying this report
used an online survey tool to gather information from a range of government and
technical partners. For World Bank programs, using both manual and text analysis
techniques, the survey team reviewed approximately 1,200 programs in all geographic
regions and involving six of the World Bank’s Global Practices: Urban Resilience and
Land; Social Development; Social Protection and Jobs; Finance, Competitiveness, and
Innovation; Agriculture; Environment and Natural Resources; and Blue Economy. To
map projects outside of World Bank operations, the survey team used PEI’s 2017 survey
dataset, the database of productive inclusion programs from the Economic Commission
for Latin America and the Caribbean, and other sources to identify ongoing projects and
key partners, including governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), regional
organizations, multilateral organizations, and other development partners involved in
economic inclusion programming.
The survey questionnaire was developed through broad consultation and consisted
of 44 questions in eight sections, including objectives, target beneficiaries,
beneficiary coverage, design and implementation features, institutional
arrangements, budgets, financing, and research and evaluation. The survey was
completed by staff from the lead implementing agency, implementing partner, or
other organization providing support to each program. A detailed overview of the
survey methodology can be found in appendix A.

BOX 3.1 Partnership for Economic Inclusion Landscape Survey 2020 (continued)
During survey preparation, the survey team identified 312 programs (166 supported by
the World Bank Group and 146 by others). After reviewing these and discounting for
overlaps, closed operations, and pipeline projects, the final survey was undertaken
for 246 programs. The overall response rate to the survey was 89 percent, resulting
in 219 programs for which data were obtained. One major challenge is the fact that
the data is self-reported, and information and interpretation may vary across survey
respondents. The survey authors factored in time for a thorough quality review of
each survey response and followed up with respondents for queries and clarifications.
The online survey provided detailed guidance and was translated into French and
Spanish to ensure clarity.

The Current Reach of Economic Inclusion Programs
The 20 million households—consisting of more than 90 million individuals—
served by economic inclusion programs today, either directly or indirectly, are
­heavily concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. More than half of
the programs are in Sub-Saharan Africa, which hosts 30 percent of ­individuals
served, through a proliferation of smaller programs. South Asia is home to
66 percent of people served. The large number of beneficiaries in this latter region
is notable given that it is host to only 15 percent of economic inclusion programs,
reflecting the scale these programs have achieved, particularly in India and
Bangladesh. A single program accounts for 51 percent of total coverage: the Bihar
(India) Rural Livelihoods Project (JEEViKA).
Figure 3.1 displays the percentage of total program beneficiaries, excluding
JEEViKA, in relation to total programs by region. Just 3 percent of programs are led
by multinational organizations, including United Nations ­agencies such as the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
and the World Food Programme (WFP). (See table D.1 in appendix D for the list of
programs and appendix E for the types of components included in them.)
Almost 70 percent of surveyed programs are in low-income countries
(categorized by the World Bank as eligible for International Development
Association financing).1 Nevertheless, economic inclusion programs of various kinds
are represented across the geographic and income spectrum, in low-, lower-middle-,
upper-middle-, and even high-income countries. This suggests applicability both in
contexts with extensive poverty and in contexts where poverty occurs in pockets.
The Latin America and the Caribbean region hosts all the programs implemented
in high-income countries as well as 67 percent of those hosted in upper-middleincome countries, and the region represents 19 percent of all programs identified in
the survey.
Close to half (49 percent) of the programs are led by government. The five largest
economic inclusion programs are all government led and build on large-scale and mature
social protection programs. (See table 3.1 for basic program details on these five.)

(L&J) programs. The figure also excludes data from JEEViKA (a government-led L&J program in India), which covers over 50 percent of
all beneficiaries in the survey. The total number of programs excluding JEEViKA is 218 (112 nongovernment-led and 106 government-led

is 45,319,700, which includes direct and indirect beneficiaries. When JEEViKA is included, the results are as follows: the number of programs
is 219 (112 nongovernment-led and 107 government-led programs or 77 SSN, 138 L&J, and 4 FI or 13 in East Asia and Pacific, 5 in Europe and
Central Asia, 41 in Latin America and the Caribbean, 16 in the Middle East and North Africa, 32 in South Asia, and 112 in Sub-Saharan Africa).
The number of total individual beneficiaries equals 91,933,700.

Diversity in Programs: Objectives and Contexts
Given the range of institutions implementing economic inclusion programs and the
variety of contexts in which they are established, the result is a wide diversity of
programming. Whether from governments or nongovernment institutions, program
planners are driven by their organizations’ priorities. They must account for country or
regional context, the services and institutions serving as partners and their institutional
cultures, and the unique challenges confronted by people living in extreme poverty and
vulnerability in that locality. While many factors account for the variations, programs

Program Objectives
The PEI Landscape Survey 2020 revealed that there are 12 objectives that are most
common and help shape economic inclusion programming for respondent programs.
As described in chapter 1, megatrends and national policy priorities, such as population
growth, forced displacement, and climate change, are challenges reflected in the
considerable range of desired outcomes for these programs.
The most common priorities among surveyed programs include building selfemployment opportunities (52 percent), income diversification (37 percent), and
resilience (32 percent) (Figure 3.2). When viewed in relation to the entry points to scale
outlined in chapter 2, differences are limited, but livelihoods and jobs (L&J) programs
focus more on women’s empowerment (23 percent), while social safety net (SSN)
programs focus more on resilience (42 percent).2
Priority objectives also vary by region. In an effort to deal with high levels of
unemployment, particularly among youths, programs in the Middle East and North Africa
and Latin America and the Caribbean overwhelmingly seek to increase employment
opportunities (wage or self-employment) (81 percent and 71 percent of the regions,
respectively). By contrast, programs in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa predominantly
seek to support income diversification (50 percent and 40 percent, respectively). In South
Asia, a high percentage of programs also focus on social inclusion (44 percent) to reduce
the social marginalization of indigenous populations and other vulnerable groups.
Governments are more likely than nongovernmental programs to focus on
increasing access to wage employment (24 percent versus 13 percent) and on increased
productivity (34 percent versus 19 percent). Conversely, nongovernment-led programs
focus more heavily than government-led programs on women’s empowerment
(22 percent versus 11 percent), resilience (38 percent versus 26 percent), and food
­security (31 percent versus 19 percent). The six multilateral programs included in the

survey have a distinct focus on resilience (two-thirds of them), food security (half
of them), and self-employment opportunities (half of them), likely linked to their
emergency or humanitarian mandates.

Contexts
National priorities, political context, and global trends can all shape economic
inclusion programs, offering both opportunities and limitations that influence program
development and imbue programs with distinct characteristics.
Most economic inclusion programs surveyed, 88 percent of all programs,
operate in rural settings, while 46 percent operate exclusively in rural areas.
This partly corresponds to the fact that extreme poverty is disproportionately
concentrated in rural settings, with about two-thirds of extremely poor people living
in rural areas (Kharas et al. 2020). As shown in Figure 3.3, 36 percent of programs
are in urban areas, 40 percent in peri-urban areas, and 42 percent operate across

rural and urban/peri-urban settings. Twelve percent of programs operate exclusively
in urban/peri-urban areas.
More than a quarter (26 percent) of all economic inclusion programs surveyed
operate in contexts of high fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV). This is based
on the World Bank’s classification of countries with high institutional and social
fragility and countries affected by violent conflict, which is in part a reflection of
the preponderance of people living in extreme poverty and vulnerability in these
areas (World Bank Group 2020). Economic inclusion programs in FCV contexts
are located primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa (75 percent of programs) and the
Middle East and North Africa region (11 percent). Many programs operating in FCV
contexts are led by NGOs or multilateral organizations (59 percent), highlighting
the key role these organizations play when government systems are weak or
absent. (See box 3.2 for further detail on the special challenges of programming in
FCV contexts.)
A majority of economic inclusion programs seek to mitigate climate change.
Climate change mitigation strategies are increasingly important for developing
sustainable livelihoods, particularly in rural areas, where climate change impacts can
be exacerbated by farm practices. Climate change can cause a loss of income due
to a lack of access to suitable financial products to buffer the shocks, in particular
savings and insurance. This not only affects the poorest but can also affect betteroff members of the community, potentially resulting in the latter households falling
below the poverty line. Such shocks typically have long-lasting negative impacts on
the poor, since they are the least able to adapt to more frequent and more severe
storms, droughts, and floods.
Fifty-seven percent of programs include interventions designed to mitigate
climate change, for example, through sustainable natural resource management
or climate change adaptation. Of these programs, 38 percent have resilience as
a main objective. Across regions, climate change mitigation efforts are more
prevalent in South Asia (75 percent) and Sub-Saharan Africa (66 percent)
than elsewhere. These regions are severely affected by rising sea levels and
drought (figure 3.4).

BOX 3.2

Economic Inclusion in Fragile and Displacement Contexts

The proportion of poor people living in contexts of fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV)
has constantly increased since 2010, and it is projected that as many as two-thirds
of people living in extreme poverty globally may be living in FCV contexts by 2030
(Corral et al. 2020). Recent analysis paints a stark picture of the implications of FCV on
individuals: a person living in an economy facing chronic fragility and conflict is 10 times
more likely to be poor than a person living in a country that has not been fragile or in
conflict in the past 20 years.
The data show that economic inclusion programs are more likely to target
displacement-affected populations, particularly internally displaced populations, in FCV
contexts than in non-FCV contexts (34 percent versus 8 percent) and focus more on
increasing resilience (43 percent versus 28 percent), social inclusion (38 percent versus
25 percent), and food security (32 percent versus 23 percent). Economic inclusion
in these contexts can help build resilience and develop economic opportunities that
may enable people to better cope with the economic and social stress while building
income and assets. But a lack of government systems and structures, and the presence
of corruption and insecurity, make it challenging to link these efforts to government
or other programs for ongoing support. Programs in FCV contexts are less likely than
programs in non-FCV settings to be government led (41 percent versus 52 percent) or
funded by government (16 percent versus 36 percent). They are also less likely than
programs in non-FCV settings to be integrated with government programs (43 percent
versus 67 percent) and delivered by linking existing programs (7 percent versus
26 percent).

Target Populations
Typically, programs target specific population groups or poverty segments, including the
poor, extreme poor, and ultrapoor (figure 3.5).3 In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia,
where the rates of extreme poverty are the highest, there are correspondingly higher
proportions of programs that target extreme poor populations than in other regions.
Many programs have eligibility criteria that participants must meet in order to join the
programs, with 78 percent of all programs using some combination of attributes that
may include age, sex, or having dependents.
Some economic inclusion programs seek to serve people in specific demographic
categories, particularly women, either because of their institutional mission or
because of program goals (figure 3.6). Eighty-eight percent of all programs target
women as a priority segment and, in 64 percent of programs that reported the
number of beneficiaries, women constitute the majority of all program participants.4
Fifteen percent of all programs (and about a fifth of those that reported the number of
female beneficiaries) serve only women.
Programs that predominantly serve women focus on building the skills and
confidence of female participants through training and coaching. As compared to
other programs, those primarily serving women typically place a strong emphasis on
life skills training (72 percent of women-focused programs versus 40 percent of other
programs) and financial training (82 percent versus 60 percent). Coaching more often
includes health and nutrition guidance (63 percent versus 27 percent) and discussions
around social issues affecting the family, such as child marriage, and intrahousehold
dynamics (68 percent versus 33 percent), as compared to other programs. Programs

that predominantly serve women also focus more on access to financial services
(74 percent versus 59 percent in other programs) (see spotlight 2).
Young people are given priority by most economic inclusion programs (57 percent
of all programs), particularly those that are built around an employment or livelihood
development intervention (62 percent). Youth employment is an area of focus for many
programs, given that young people are more likely to be excluded economically than
adults: since 1995, youth unemployment rates have been persistently about three times
higher than adult unemployment rates (ILO 2020). Youths represent roughly a fourth of
the global working population, but the rate of job creation is not keeping up with the
increase in the number of young people who will enter the job market in the coming
years, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan
Africa (UNDP 2015, 64).
Achieving better employment outcomes, in terms of enhanced wage or self-­
employment opportunities, is more prevalent as a core objective among programs
that target youths than in other programs (64 percent versus 51 percent), with
government and nongovernment programs equally committed to this area. Among
government-led programs, all seven programs in the Middle East and North
Africa region and four out of five programs in the East Asia and Pacific region are

BOX 3.3 Identifying and Customizing Entrepreneurship Support
Most economic inclusion programs target the poor, but this is not a homogenous
group. While some self-employed poor people are entrepreneurs by choice (so-called
transformational entrepreneurs), a majority are self-employed by necessity (reluctant or
subsistence entrepreneurs) (Schoar 2010; Banerjee and Duflo 2011). For most economic
inclusion programs, the majority of participants are likely to be subsistence entrepreneurs,
people who operate at low levels of profitability, with little differentiation from other
local businesses and few opportunities for growth. These entrepreneurs manage to
increase their earnings, but they function more as own-account workers rather than
microenterprises that create jobs. They may also transition into wage employment if an
opportunity arises (Bandiera et al. 2017; de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2010).
However, some participants have the necessary entrepreneurial skills to start a
business and even transition to become small firms, as economic inclusion programs
relax the barriers to their entry and growth. This group requires more customized
support in adopting expansion strategies and market links. This distinction between
types of entrepreneurs raises two questions for program design.
What characteristics are associated with entry into and success in self-employment?
Competency, a combination of knowledge, skills, and attitudes, is an important
determinant of success. Specific personality traits are good predictors of
entrepreneurial behavior, including risk taking, self-efficacy, and stress tolerance,
among others (Arco-Tirado et al. 2019). Many communities attribute entrepreneurial
success to hard work and perseverance (see, for example, Poulin and Bomuhangi
2018; Bossuroy, Koussoubé, and Premand 2019). In particular, grit—a combination of
passion and perseverance for long-term goals—may be a key determinant of long-term
success (Duckworth et al. 2007). Grit is related to self-employment, particularly for risk
takers, women, and younger adults (Wolfe and Patel 2016) and with the creation of
new businesses (Mooradian et al. 2016; Mueller, Wolfe, and Syed 2017). Socioeconomic
status is also important; among youths with high levels of grit, those with higher income
levels or with lower satisfaction with their financial status are more likely to become
entrepreneurs relative to those with low income or those satisfied with their status
(Arco-Tirado et al. 2019). However, further research is required in this area.
What approaches can be used to identify these two types of entrepreneurs and to
customize the bundle of interventions? Through training and coaching, many economic
inclusion programs seek to equip both “reluctant” and “transformational” entrepreneurs
to think creatively, take measured risks, improve problem-solving capabilities, and
persevere in the face of failure. Participants often highlight their increased selfconfidence as a result of this support; these programs can be an important mechanism
to build grit. However, differences in trajectories reveal a set of fast climbers who
benefit most and acquire self-confidence through experiential learning during the
program. Slow climbers may require additional support and personalized coaching.
Some economic inclusion programs use business plan competitions to select
participants with innovative ideas and the competence and personality traits associated
with success. These are often targeted at groups to benefit from the complementarity
of skills. Successful groups may or may not be provided with coaching. For instance,
Uganda’s Youth Opportunity Program asked youths to form groups and prepare
(Box continues next page)

Identifying and Customizing Entrepreneurship Support (continued)

business proposals (with some coaching support). Successful applicants each received
a cash grant with some training, but no supervision or individualized coaching was
provided after the grant. The program had significant positive impacts on earnings,
capital stock, and business practices that persisted for at least four years (Blattman,
Fiala, and Martinez 2014). Peru’s Haku Wiñay program also supports the creation of
group-based microbusinesses, but in addition to providing some coaching to develop a
viable business proposal, it continues to provide training and support links to markets.
Other economic inclusion programs, especially those targeting the poorest, focus
on income-generation activities for both the reluctant and transformational types of
entrepreneurs. But given differences in trajectories, some programs introduced mid-term
assessments to identify the slow and fast climbers. In India (West Bengal) and Haiti, this
assessment builds on the targeting tool (used to identify beneficiaries) to track progress
and reconfigure the bundle of interventions for these groups during the program (Huda
and Simanowitz 2010; Huda 2009). However, these assessments do not typically include
measures of grit or other personality traits, which might be challenging for field staff
to capture without sufficient training. In addition, trade-offs exist: standardized case
management may be easier to scale up and replicate compared to a highly customized
approach (Huda and Simanowitz 2010; Jawahar and Sengupta 2012).

youth employment programs. Eighty-two percent of the 125 programs serving youth
populations promote employment opportunities by combining training and coaching
with wage employment facilitation or business capital. Box 3.3 provides further details
on how programs that are focused on enhancing self-employment opportunities adapt
their approaches to the particular needs of young populations.
About a third of programs serve populations affected by displacement, particularly
refugees (two-thirds of programs serving displacement-affected people). Between 2012
and 2018, the number of forcibly displaced people worldwide more than doubled, to
70.8 million (UNHCR 2019). While forced displacements are mostly a result of conflict,
violence, or human rights violations, climate change is expected to significantly add to
the numbers of forcibly displaced people in the coming years, particularly in South Asia
and Sub-Saharan Africa (Rigaud et al. 2018).
Roughly 40 percent of all forcibly displaced people are refugees. Many refugees
have limited or no right to work and are therefore compelled into informal employment
without regular earnings or social protection, and many are hosted in developing
countries suffering social and economic strain (UNHCR 2018). The 2018 United Nations
Global Compact on Refugees commits to reducing the pressure of displacement by
helping displaced people benefit from national programs with support from the
international community and by enhancing refugee self-reliance.
A significant number of economic inclusion programs target refugees (21 percent),
in response to the tremendous challenges host governments face with the influx or
displacement of increasing numbers of people (Ayoubi et al. 2017). Economic inclusion
programs targeting refugees, internally displaced people, or host communities often
build on the humanitarian assistance available to them through organizations such
as UNHCR and WFP, assistance that acts as a social safety net on which economic
inclusion components are built. Economic inclusion programs can also utilize
humanitarian cash transfers, in particular if they are digitized, helping beneficiaries
increase household resilience and build human capital (El-Zoghbi et al. 2017).
71

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

Most programs working with refugee populations are led by NGOs or multilateral
organizations (71 percent of the 21 percent prioritizing refugees). UNHCR is involved
in 36 percent of programs working with refugees, either as lead agency, as funder, or
as the implementing partner. Programs serving refugees are more likely than other
programs to facilitate access to markets (84 percent versus 68 percent) and to work
with the private sector to create wage employment opportunities (74 percent versus
47 percent). This is because displaced populations often arrive in new living contexts
lacking familiarity with local markets and sometimes having skill sets and experience
that do not match local demand.
People with disabilities are represented in 26 percent of programs in the PEI
Landscape Survey 2020, among both government-led and nongovernment-led programs
equally. Early experience from program implementers suggests that economic inclusion

BOX 3.4

People with Disabilities

An estimated 15 percent of the global population live with some form of disability
(World Bank 2011), and people with disabilities are more likely to experience poverty
than others due to a lack of employment and education opportunities, lower wages,
and the increased cost of living with a disability. Barriers to full social and economic
inclusion of people with disabilities include inaccessible physical environments and
transportation, the unavailability of assistive devices and technologies, nonadapted
means of communication, gaps in service delivery, and discriminatory prejudice and
stigma in society. The employment-to-population ratio of people with disabilities
ages 15 and older is almost half that of people without disabilities (UNDESA 2018).
Programs that target people with disabilities also focus more than other programs
on wage facilitation (46 percent versus 31 percent) to help participants build regular
streams of income and also to foster greater self-confidence and to challenge societal
biases. For example, the Chilean government’s program, Fórmate para el Trabajo: Línea
para Personas en Situación de Discapacidad, links people with disabilities to accessible
wage employment opportunities. Finally, programs like Humanity and Inclusion’s
Alliance for Community Resilience in West Africa (with a consortium of seven NGOs) are
also trying to facilitate links to complementary services, such as rehabilitation, health
care, and psychosocial support, which can improve the long-term chances of obtaining
successful livelihoods.
As COVID-19 continues to have wide-reaching impacts across the globe, people with
disabilities are uniquely affected. In particular, many people with disabilities have
additional underlying health needs that make them particularly vulnerable to severe
symptoms of COVID-19 if they contract it. People with disabilities may also be at
increased risk of contracting COVID-19 because information about the disease, including
the symptoms and prevention, are not provided in accessible formats, such as print
materials in Braille, sign language interpretation, captions, audio provision, and graphics.
The social distancing measures imposed by COVID-19 may create greater barriers to full
social and economic inclusion of people with disabilities due to inaccessible physical
environments and transportation, the unavailability of assistive devices and technologies,
nonadapted means of communication, and gaps in service delivery.a

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

programs should, as needed and feasible, support care providers as well as enable
people with disabilities to engage in economic activities themselves. While some smaller
programs work exclusively with people with disabilities, others also include other
community members and work on reducing stigma and isolation. Some NGO programs,
like Trickle Up’s Desde El Poder Local in Guatemala, also work with participants to
consider livelihood options beyond traditional home-based activities and explore higherreturn livelihood options outside the home. (See box 3.4 for more information.)

Program Components
Most economic inclusion programs provide an integrated package of interventions,
rather than one or two stand-alone interventions, because their design is based on
the recognition that the poorest and most vulnerable people face multiple constraints.
Most commonly, these packages comprise five or more broad components. This is
true of 83 percent of all programs. As depicted in figure 3.7, a higher concentration
of government-led programs than nongovernment-led programs provide two to four
components, but the majority of both programs provide at least five components
(75 percent of government-led and 91 percent of nongovernment-led). Programs most
commonly include transfers, skills training, coaching, and financial services facilitation
(see figure 3.9).
It is also common for program components to be provided in sequence and in
a time-bound period, which may last from one to three years. Figure 3.8 shows that
in 84 percent of programs, beneficiaries access components in a specific order, a
design intended to address barriers participants face during the course of program
implementation. This sequencing may also influence the duration of the intervention,
which is from 1 year to more than 3 years in 84 percent of programs (figure 3.8). Budget
or other resource limitations or technical considerations, such as the duration of the
production cycle for livelihoods supported by the program, may also influence why
different programs choose different program durations. Ninety-six percent of programs
provide all or some of their program components over a time-bound period. Economic
inclusion programs that build on existing government programs are more likely than

other programs to include open-ended interventions (35 percent versus 21 percent), as
participation in many government programs is not time bound. For example, in many
SSN programs, the social assistance is open-ended while the additional economic
inclusion components are time bound.
Figure 3.9 illustrates how eight of the most common components are distributed
among programs. Whether they are led by governments or NGOs, programs most
commonly include transfers (68 percent), business ­capital (80 percent), skills training
(97 percent), coaching (90 percent), and financial services facilitation (71 percent).
Ninety-five percent of programs sampled provide some form of transfer, which
could be the basis for both consumption-smoothing (68 percent of all programs) as
well as business development (80 percent of all programs). A noncontributory transfer
is the single component that typically drives program costs. This is in line with the
costing analysis in chapter 6, which shows that programs allocate between 50 and
86 percent of their overall cost to this component. It is likely that most economic
inclusion programs seek to jump-start economic activities with business capital while
increasing the chances of their success through training, coaching, and access to
finance. Of the programs that include a transfer for consumption support, 48 percent
represent existing government cash transfer programs and 25 percent link support to
participation in a government public works program. About half of the programs that
provide a transfer for business development are linked to a government enterprise
development program.
Regardless of the type of program, most interventions provide cash for the transfer
(95 percent of programs that include some form of transfer), but differences emerge in
the modality used for different purposes by entry point (figure 3.10). Cash transfers,
especially when made digitally, are preferred to in-kind assistance because they

significantly ease the logistical demands on those implementing the program while
giving participants more choice in their use of funds. Cash transfers also provide an
opportunity to acquire cash management skills and to save formally, especially if a
digital transfer is made to an account where recipients can save.
Most programs focus on facilitating self-employment, particularly in rural areas and
low-income countries, where wage employment opportunities tend to be more limited
than elsewhere. In supporting self-employment, most economic inclusion programs
seek to jump-start economic activities with business capital while increasing the
chances of success through training, coaching, and access to finance. Sixty-one percent
of programs combine these four components to jointly address financial and human
capital constraints (68 percent in rural areas versus 42 percent in urban areas and
65 percent in lower-income countries versus 44 percent in upper- and high-income
countries).
Governments typically have infrastructure in place that supports employment
programs, so government economic inclusion interventions focus more than
nongovernment interventions on wage employment (42 percent versus 28 percent).
Nongovernment programs focus more on providing business finance (85 percent
versus 76 percent) to facilitate self-employment opportunities. Of the 42 percent of
government programs that facilitate access to wage employment, 40 percent are linked
to an existing government labor intermediation program and 27 percent are linked to an
active labor market policy.
The biggest constraint to wage employment through economic inclusion programs
is the absence of job opportunities. Most programs that support access to wage
employment foster links with employers, particularly L&J programs (64 percent versus
39 percent for SSN programs). For example, 79 percent of programs that facilitate
access to wage employment assist participants in accessing job placements or
internships, while 55 percent engage with the private sector to create wage employment
opportunities.
Most programs are time bound, but interventions that can bring about long-term
changes in attitudes and investment behavior can help achieve sustained impact.
Toward this end, 97 percent of surveyed programs include training, which for the
purpose of the survey was defined as structured teaching with the aim of transferring
specific skills and knowledge. Another common component, coaching, is provided
by 90 percent of programs. Defined as informal guidance provided in an informal
way, coaching is used by programs to build soft skills, support self-confidence,
provide emotional support, and foster changes in attitudes and social norms. It may
be particularly important for achieving behavioral changes, including changes in the
habit of saving formally (Huda and Simanowitz 2010). Eighty-nine percent of programs
provide both training and coaching, which highlights the value of effective skillbuilding by facilitating regular learning activities using different formats.5 (See box 3.5
for details on new directions in coaching.)
Promoting financial inclusion (FI) is core to economic inclusion programs.
Facilitating access to financial services is a critical means of ensuring the sustainability
of economic gains for the household. Links to appropriate financial services, in
particular savings and microinsurance services, can help poor households build their
resilience and livelihoods. Seventy-one percent of surveyed programs facilitate access to
financial services, including 88 percent of those in South Asia and 72 percent of those
in Sub-Saharan Africa. Forty-seven percent of programs facilitating access to financial
services build on a government’s FI program.
Formal financial services are more often fostered by governments than
nongovernmental programs, either by partnering with formal financial service providers

BOX 3.5

Coaching at Scale

Coaching, also known as mentoring, is one of the main components of many economic
inclusion programs. It usually consists of regular face-to-face visits from a field worker
or community member to help beneficiaries overcome social and emotional barriers,
track progress in income-generating activities, reinforce training concepts, boost selfconfidence, and introduce additional topics that help improve participants’ overall wellbeing, such as health, nutrition, and legal rights. This component may create a capacity
challenge, in particular for governments, as it requires additional training for frontline
workers and supervisors and adjustments to human resource rules and incentives.
Coaching provides a vital mechanism for monitoring how participants are responding
to program elements. Coaches are not experts but individuals equipped with general
skills and knowledge on a range of topics and with an ability to link participants to other
resources. This may also require recruiting resource persons who are community based
and receive specialized training, support, tools, and compensation, as elaborated in the
JEEViKA case study (case study 2). Programs may also tap existing community trainers,
such as through the use of yachachiq, community leaders utilized as trainers in the
Haku Wiñay case study (case study 4).
Group coaching. Many economic inclusion programs are exploring options to enhance
impact and reduce costs by shifting from individual to group-based coaching. This can
reduce program delivery costs as well as administrative burden. Well-designed groupbased interventions can promote social interactions in the community and help the poor
build social capital (Blattman et al. 2016; Macours and Vakis 2014).
Customized coaching topics. Individual coaching and customized advice may
be necessary, for example, to help some types of microentrepreneurs grow their
businesses (Kabeer et al. 2012). The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) is adapting its economic inclusion programs in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Zambia,
and Zimbabwe for refugees by systematically adding psychosocial and legal counseling
to the bundle of interventions (UNHCR 2019). UNHCR’s challenge in these places is to
reduce delivery costs. (See chapter 6 for a discussion of cost issues.)
Digital tools. Some programs, including those supported by Fundación Capital in a
variety of locations, are experimenting with the provision of coaching through a mix of
in-person interactions and tablet-based videos or training modules designed for very
poor and nonliterate participants (MacLennan 2017). Equipping coaches with digital
tools can allow them to gather real-time data, facilitating the collection of participant
information for program oversight and performance management. To break through the
cognitive traps that poor people face (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013), digital coaching
content needs to focus on their priority areas with relevant, engaging, and practical
content.

(40 percent versus 20 percent) or leveraging formal community groups (29 percent
versus 23 percent). Nongovernment-led programs tend to favor facilitating access to
financial services through informal community groups, such as rotating savings and
credit associations and village savings and loan associations, more than governmentled programs do (59 percent versus 38 percent). In some countries, including Peru,

77

the economic inclusion program is designed to foster “last mile” financial inclusion of
the poorest and most vulnerable rural population, with program transfers delivered to
financially inclusive bank accounts and with tailored financial literacy training.
Economic inclusion programs also seek to enhance market access and strengthen
links among producers, buyers, and other value chain actors. Poor and vulnerable
households face many barriers to market access, such as remoteness from the nearest
market and prices that leave them with very small profit margins. Challenges like these
limit their ability to develop their businesses into profitable enterprises.
Seventy-one percent of all surveyed programs reported that they assist participants
with integration into markets, and this was true of 80 percent of programs that
operate exclusively in rural areas. Programs help participants link to existing value
chains and markets, and some even support the creation of new value chains (local,
regional, national, or international). Sixty-three percent of government-led programs
(or 51 percent of all programs facilitating market access) link participants to existing
cooperatives, such as producer or marketing cooperatives, to help participants sell their
products and increase their margins.
Developing community platforms, such as producer organizations or federated
self-help groups, can further expand livelihood opportunities and increase program
sustainability. This is particularly true if these community organizations are formally
linked to other market actors, including financial service providers and private training
providers. Economic inclusion programs can work with market players in key sectors
where informal workers, producers, and entrepreneurs can have better interaction
and negotiation with market players. In India, the National Rural Livelihood Mission
has invested in economic organizations like farmer- and women-owned producer
companies and thousands of farmer organizations around agriculture, livestock, and
nonfarm opportunities through which participants build partnerships through value
chains with many market players (see spotlight 3).
More than half of programs support natural resource management, climate
change adaptation, or both (57 percent of all programs). Sustainable natural resource
management and climate change mitigation strategies are often coupled with programs
that build households’ resilience and/or income diversification to increase households’
ability to cope with climate-related disasters and environmental shocks.6 In the Sahel,
for example, key challenges to the management of renewable resources include
increasing conflict between pastoralists and farmers due to competition for land and
water, coupled with poor soils and soil erosion, which impact agricultural productivity
and crop yields. The problem is not necessarily one of absolute water scarcity but
rather a lack of infrastructure to ensure an adequate supply of water in dry seasons or
years (USAID 2017).

Future Directions
The PEI Landscape Survey 2020 provides a snapshot of economic inclusion programs
implemented globally, with 219 programs reaching over 90 million beneficiaries.
Growth is driven by governments in low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and
South Asia. The true universe of economic inclusion programs is almost certainly
larger. The survey results reveal that half of programs are government led, and many
build on existing SSNs and other government interventions. The data presented
are lower-bound estimates and reflect information reported by country teams. Data
presented in this chapter are available at http://www.peiglobal.org, a site that allows
programs to upload, update, and use data as a global public good.

Economic inclusion programs are implemented in a variety of contexts, and
geographies and among a variety of target groups. Rural residents, women, and specific
vulnerable groups are clear priorities. Governments are adapting existing antipoverty
programs to strengthen economic inclusion outcomes for improved resilience and
opportunity. The dominant entry point to scaling up is likely to be SSN programs—
especially as these programs mature.
Economic inclusion programs provide an integrated package of interventions.
They typically include five or more components, and most commonly feature cash
transfers, skills training, coaching, market links, and access to financial services. The
most frequently cited objectives of economic inclusion programs are self-employment,
income diversification, and resilience. This coheres to an agenda with a strong rural
focus (88 percent of all programs) and an increasing emphasis on fragility (one in
four programs), with one in three programs focusing on displaced populations.
Cash transfers are a leading component, as they provide flexible spending options
to the poorest people. Different programs are testing the benefits of regular payments
versus lump-sum payments, or a mix of both.
A strong focus is emerging on youths. Over half the programs in the PEI
Landscape Survey 2020 focus on youth, reflecting broader demographic and
urbanization megatrends. Youths experience high levels of underemployment
and uncertain pathways to formal jobs, and economic inclusion programs will
play an important role in addressing them, but programs will need to adapt
to ensure effectivelinks to complementary services. Close to three quarters of
programs help participants link to existing value chains and markets, with some
even supporting the creation of new value chains (local, regional, national, and
international).
Coaching and entrepreneurial support need to be strengthened and streamlined.
Innovations in program delivery are emerging, including digital options and through
self-help groups and peer-to-peer learning networks. Going forward, it is critical to
identify the design features required to address the constraints of people in specific
population subgroups or in certain contexts. This requires testing innovations to
correctly size the individual components, the package overall, and how it is delivered,
based on an assessment of the needs and potential of target populations in each
context.
Economic inclusion programs in fragile settings are poised to continue to grow,
requiring a better understanding of operational models. Good practices in linking
economic inclusion to humanitarian interventions and facilitating market links in
fragile settings need to be documented. Guidance is also needed on best operational
models and delivery systems in other contexts, including on how much of the
package should be delivered directly by the central government; when and how to
partner with other public sectoral agencies, local governments, or local NGOs; how
to develop effective links to bring in complementary services; and how to develop
appropriate incentive systems for program managers and frontline workers.
Economic inclusion programs are well placed to overcome some of the challenges
faced by people with disabilities in increasing their economic opportunities. The body
of knowledge on how to adapt design and delivery of programs to increase outcomes
for people with disabilities is growing.
Finally, with economic inclusion programs already being used as a flexible
response to varied realities, they are well poised to be a medium- and long-term
response to the COVID-19 crisis. With adaptive social protection systems forming the
backbone of the first wave of response, the scale-up of economic inclusion programs
is an important complement for households and communities moving forward.

relation to their income levels and record of success in managing their economies and their
ongoing IDA projects. IDA’s lending terms are highly concessional, meaning that IDA credits
carry no or low interest charges. See IDA, “Financing,” https://ida.worldbank.org/financing​
/­ida-financing.
The survey identified each program’s priority objectives by asking respondents to name their
three main program objectives.
The survey conducted by PEI between November 2019 and May 2020 used the following
definitions: The poor are those whose consumption is below the national poverty line
as defined by government or those who, because of their personal and/or community
characteristics, face barriers in accessing opportunities to earn sustainable livelihoods and
have elevated risks of being or staying in poverty and/or being socially marginalized. The
extreme poor are those whose consumption is below $1.90 per day (2011 purchasing power
parity, PPP), also defined as the bottom 50 percent of the poor population in a country or
those unable to meet basic needs. The latter definition captures relative poverty as well
as dynamics in lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income countries. The ultrapoor
are those whose consumption is below $0.95 per day (2011 PPP). Also defined as those
experiencing the most severe forms of deprivation, for example, persistent hunger, lack of
sources of income, and so forth. Finally, the other vulnerable are groups that do not meet any
of the above criteria, for example, those just above the poverty line, and marginalized groups
irrespective of their poverty level.
Data on female coverage are based on data from 164 programs (the number of programs
reporting on the number of beneficiaries). Among those programs for which data on the
number female beneficiaries are missing (55 programs), the majority (52 programs) target or
prioritize women, so it is possible that the figure reported here is biased downward—that
the percentage of programs where most beneficiaries are female is higher.
Many studies suggest that the duration of training matters, with short courses having much
less positive impact than longer ones (Kluve 2016). The PEI Landscape Survey 2020, however,
did not capture information on duration, intensity, or other quality aspects that may affect the
impact of training activities on participants.
Programs that have resilience as one of their main objectives (70 programs, or 32 percent
of all surveyed programs) are more likely to include natural resource management or
climate change adaptation interventions than programs that do not seek to build resilience
(67 percent versus 52 percent). The same holds true for programs seeking to support income
diversification (81 percent versus 42 percent). Both correlations are statistically significant, at
5 percent and 1 percent, respectively.

SPOTLIGHT 2

Promoting Women’s Empowerment
through Economic Inclusion
The potential to boost the economic empowerment of women takes center stage in
many of the programs assessed in this report. Eighty-eight percent of all programs
in the survey prioritize female participants, and in 64 percent of these programs,
women constitute the majority of participants. Fifteen percent of all programs (and
about a fifth of those that reported the number of female beneficiaries) serve only
women. Increasing incomes and assets of beneficiaries is a core goal of economic
inclusion programs—whether they target women or not—but in addition to pursuing
the economic empowerment of women, some programs also seek to empower
women in other realms of their lives. These programs use economic inclusion as the
starting point, building the skills and confidence of female participants through other
interventions such as training and coaching. Seventeen percent of programs in the
survey deliberately try to further women’s overall empowerment through economic
inclusion.
Leaving women out of the productive economy limits economic growth overall
and increases inequality. Gender inequality is associated with lower labor productivity
and poorer overall economic growth (Kabeer and Natali 2013). Not only does gender
equality have an impact on women’s individual well-being, it also imparts benefits to
future generations and communities (World Bank Group 2015).
Bundled economic inclusion interventions are uniquely placed to address the
plurality of constraints poor women face and to empower them beyond the economic
domain. Each program component plays a role in promoting improved gender
outcomes: productive cash transfers can help women take ownership of a sustainable
livelihood that increases assets and the ability to earn income; training builds women’s
capacity; and coaching helps build social capital through enhanced life skills, selfconfidence, and greater awareness of legal rights. The coaching and peer-to-peer
exchange that occur during economic inclusion program activities can also help to
increase women’s agency—elevating their voice, influence, and decision-making power
in the community, the household, and their own lives. Increasing women’s agency
can also be achieved through women’s involvement in community institutions and
local governance, which can develop their capacity to access and effectively make use
of increased economic opportunities, their increased self-esteem, and their increased
knowledge about and motivation to exercise their rights (Lazlo 2019).

Key Directions for Gender-Intentional Program
Design and Implementation
This section summarizes a range of country experiences to highlight the genderintentional design and delivery steps in economic inclusion programs. Experience
from a range of programs suggests that there is a need to design programs for women
that move beyond solely strengthening their economic base to also ensure that
program delivery mechanisms are deliberate in addressing the specific constraints of
beneficiaries. The observations that follow draw from a portfolio review of World Bank
Group operations and the broader literature. Box S2.1 highlights key findings from
qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

BOX S2.1

Assimilating the Evidence on Gender and Economic Inclusion Programs

In the review of impact literature in chapter 5, economic inclusion programs were found
to hold strong potential for women’s empowerment. Programs strengthened women’s
economic opportunities, increasing their contribution to household income, while
asset ownership positively impacted social status in and outside the household. Many
programs also contributed to subtle shifts in gender norms by increasing women’s
mobility. For many women, being able to fulfill parental and community responsibilities
helped to increase their self-esteem.
However, impact on women’s control over resources and their agency in the
household was mixed and highly context specific (see, for example, Banerjee et al.
2015; Bedoya Arguelles et al. 2019; Bandiera et al. 2017; World Bank 2020; Siddiki et
al. 2014). Similarly, the impact on women’s exposure to intimate-partner violence was
also mixed and context specific. Although it is possible that women’s participation in
economic activities may have exacerbated household tensions when their work was
seen as displacing care responsibilities (Holmes and Jones 2013), the limited evidence
suggests the opposite, that is, a reduction in violence at least in some contexts (Karimli,
Rost, and Ismayilova 2018; Das et al. 2016).
Impacts on women’s empowerement were also muted in contexts where social norms
restricted women’s movement and participation outside the home or the community. In
Pakistan, for example, few women participated in economic activities outside their homes
and thus needed support from male household members (Kabeer et al. 2012).
Similarly, a combination of a cash grant and training for women in two contexts had
different short-term outcomes. In Uganda, a combination of finance and human capital
interventions was sufficient to create new enterprises and help women grow their
businesses (Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2014). In Sri Lanka, the same combination
helped new entrants but did not help existing entrepreneurs grow, suggesting binding
social constraints for women entrepreneurs (de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2014).
Household endowments and relationship dynamics also influence a program’s impact
on women. Women cannot avail themselves of opportunities if they do not have the
resources or support from family or community members to balance paid work and unpaid
family care work. For instance, in Haiti women with cooperative partners who provided
them support as they engaged with the program were better able to take advantage of
opportunities the program offered than women with no partners. Also, women with partners
who were uncooperative fared poorly in the program (Shoaf and Simanowitz 2019). In
West Bengal, participants who had early success in the Trickle Up graduation program,
“fast climbers,” had more adult males in the family or in their extended network than “slow
climbers.” The slowest climbers were women with uncooperative husbands, who were a
drain on household resources (Kabeer et al. 2012).

Gender-Sensitive Program Design
Targeting women as the primary recipient of economic inclusion programs does not
automatically ensure female control over assets. Evidence shows that simply providing
access to resources will not lead to meaningful change in a woman’s life if she does
not have the power to make decisions about the use of resources. The potential for
enhanced access will not translate into improved well-being (Bardasi and Garcia 2014).
Deliberate targeting is coupled with intentional female-focused design in the Targeting

84

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

the Ultra Poor program implemented by the Microfinance Investment Support Facility
for Afghanistan. The program is open to male-headed households, but targeting
criteria place more weight on the selection of female-headed households, that are more
vulnerable. However, regardless of whether the primary program beneficiary is female
or male, the program makes a substantial effort to ensure that women are the main
recipients of the consumption support stipends in order to increase their influence
and bargaining power in the household. The women are also actively engaged in the
technical training for the productive activity, even if they are not the direct recipients
of the program. These strategies have helped begin to increase the voice and status
of women in the household despite the fact that the program operates in a very
challenging and fragile context (Bedoya Arguelles et al. 2019).
The training and coaching components of economic inclusion programs are
effective for increasing the life skills, self-confidence, and agency of women. Among
survey respondents, programs that predominantly serve women have a stronger
emphasis than those programs that do not on life-skills building (72 percent versus
40 percent) and financial training (82 percent versus 60 percent). The coaching
component can also be adjusted to strengthen outcomes for women: programs that
primarily serve women, when compared with programs that do not, tend to include
more health and nutrition guidance (63 percent versus 27 percent) and discussions
around social issues affecting the family, such as child marriage and intrahousehold
dynamics (68 percent versus 27 percent).
Gender-sensitive economic inclusion programs can help reduce the gap in access
to financial services in developing countries.1 Among survey respondents, 74 percent of
the programs serving a majority of women link them to financial services as compared
to 59 percent for programs that do not predominately serve women. Some programs,
such as India’s Tejaswini Socioeconomic Empowerment of Adolescent Girls and
Young Women program and the São Tomé and Principe’s Social Protection and Skills
Development Project, also draw attention to addressing literacy constraints, especially
for older adolescent females.
Livelihoods are not gender neutral, and different livelihoods have specific time
and physical labor requirements. Gendered market analysis helps programs develop
livelihoods options most suitable for women. In particular, programs need to ensure
women have appropriate access to information about prices and exert control over the
sale of their goods (de Montesquiou and Sheldon 2018). In places like Coastal Sindh in
Pakistan, restrictions on women’s mobility in the public domain significantly limit their
ability to engage in certain livelihoods and make them dependent on intermediaries
both to provide inputs and sell outputs (Hashemi, de Montesquiou, and McKee 2016;
and Kabeer et al. 2012). Home-based activities such as raising poultry or producing
honey involve low-intensity tasks, and both allow for time for other activities such as
household chores and childcare, although they may also reinforce gender norms with
women taking on low-productivity activities that can be done at home.
Engaging men while implementing programs for women is essential to ensure
their buy-in and facilitate behavior change. Preexisting social, economic, institutional,
and environmental conditions are essential factors to consider when supporting
women’s empowerment, especially favorable gender norms and the quality of spousal
relationships (Kabeer et al. 2012). Increasingly, programs are working with men to
influence how women are viewed and treated in the household, redistribute care and
income-generation responsibilities, reduce the risk of gender-based violence, and
challenge accepted gender roles. For example, some programs hold focused discussions
with male household members around the role of women and the importance of shared
housework and financial decision-making. In Malawi, Concern Worldwide is trying
to better understand how programs can improve intrahousehold decision-making
with a couples’ empowerment training that is being evaluated through a randomized
85

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

controlled trial implemented by the Trinity College Impact Evaluation Unit. In Zambia,
the government has partnered with BRAC to incorporate interventions for engaging
men, such as a community gender dialogue, into its economic inclusion program for
rural women. The Eastern Recovery Project in the Democratic Republic of Congo also
uses sensitization to ensure program adaptations are not met with resistance by male
household members and do not create community animosity.
Engaging the community, particularly social networks, is important in the effort
to challenge social norms. Many programs utilize existing community groups or create
new ones to provide a safe place for women to interact and build social capital. Groups
can include village organizations, savings or producer groups, or affinity groups, and
each can serve as a platform to deliver key program components, such as training and
coaching, making programs more efficient by delivering their interventions to groups and
drawing on the strength of mutual support. At JEEViKA in Bihar, India, women’s village
organizations are used to help programs identify ostracized and excluded households. Some
programs engage with community leaders, local governments, and other key actors in the
community to raise awareness about women’s issues. For example, a Trickle Up project in
India promoted gender justice through collective action by mobilizing women’s groups,
training participants in gender rights, and encouraging them to develop and strengthen
culturally relevant gender justice initiatives. Trickle Up assisted them in documenting their
own gender justice experiences to share with and motivate others in their communities.
Trickle Up also promotes sexual and reproductive rights for girls and young women and
rights to girls’ education in Guatemala and other countries (Arévalo, Kaffenberger, and
de Montesquiou 2018). Cambodia’s Livelihood Enhancement and Association of the
Poor project prioritizes women in the formation of thrift groups, which allow women to
collectively save money while building social capital.

Gender-Sensitive Program Delivery
It is important to make it easier for women to participate in programs by delivering
components in a manner that addresses the specific constraints they face. The
following touches on particularly salient factors.
Staffing. Economic inclusion interventions require significant capacity building
of staff at all levels and the endorsement of leadership, especially when implemented
through existing government structures. Making women’s empowerment a key
objective of a program adds a layer of complexity and training in order to increase
staff’s capacity to handle gender issues. It is important to train local staff to recognize
their own biases and help them understand how gender barriers intersect with other
forms of discrimination based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, and
other aspects of identity. In certain contexts, cultural norms can make it difficult for
women to interact with male program staff. In Afghanistan, the Targeting the Ultra
Poor program is making a deliberate effort to hire females, although this is challenging
in a fragile country with strong patriarchal culture where few women are qualified to
take on this type of job. In Mauritania, the Adaptive Safety Net program also found it
difficult to hire female staff because travel was challenging, either because the women
had small children or because their travel was not culturally sanctioned.
However, hiring women as frontline staff is often critical given the broader
coaching role they are expected to play and the engagement with sensitive subjects
they often must deal with, such as gender-based violence or family planning. While
the importance of having female frontline providers is clear, recruiting them is not
without challenges in contexts where female literacy levels are low or their ability
to work outside the home might be limited. In order to mitigate the challenges of
recruiting female staff members, the Girls’ Education and Women’s Empowerment and
86

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

Livelihoods Project (GEWEL) program in Zambia is setting up a network of women
volunteers in communities to deliver life and business skills training and to coach
beneficiaries, thus removing the imperative to travel.
Payments and delivery mechanisms. Digitization of transfers, access to digital
financial services, and e-coaching may make it easier for women to access services
and content from home, easing mobility and time constraints. However, in delivering
program components, there is a need to factor in women’s limited ownership and
access to key assets, including phones and bikes. The GEWEL program in Zambia is
adapting the delivery of program components to better serve women. It has developed
a unique payment system to deliver the grants, and women can choose the delivery
option that suits them best. Fundación Capital in Latin America is ensuring that women
have ownership by providing the digital delivery of funds into digital accounts opened
in their names. Digital financial services can help foster women’s financial inclusion
in places where women have access to phones but bank accounts are still often held
by men. The confidentiality that digital transfers enables may increase the prospect
for women to have control over the resources and mitigate the risk of having funds
appropriated by other family members (Chamberlin et al. 2019).
Childcare and flexibility. Childcare can constrain participation in economic
inclusion programs for many women. Organizations operating in Afghanistan, India,
Pakistan, and Zambia adapt their program delivery to accommodate women by
providing sessions near beneficiaries’ homes and allowing flexible arrangements to
increase participation. For example, the Tejaswini program in India provides training
closer to women’s houses so that they can attend with their children. In some cases,
providing childcare facilities, or compensation for childcare, can also help alleviate
constraints (de Montesquiou and Sheldon 2018).

The Challenges
There is growing recognition that the decades of focus on women’s economic
empowerment have failed to bring about significant structural improvements in
women’s broader autonomy, voice, and agency. Mainstream approaches to women’s
economic empowerment improve access to resources but fail to acknowledge that
social, political, and market systems are structured in a way that reflects and reinforces
the societal inequalities that shaped them (Razavi and Miller 1995; Kabeer 2005;
Cornwall 2014).
Without directly confronting the issues of power and social justice—that is,
transforming the political, social, and structural dimensions of gender inequality—
gender injustice will continue to exacerbate poverty and hinder social development
(Kabeer and Natali 2013; UN Women 2013; Cavalcanti and Tavares 2016; World Bank
2019). In Kenya, the BOMA project includes interventions to address men and boys,
reduce community-level sociocultural barriers, and address the gender-based division of
labor, unequal control over political and economic resources, and domestic and public
violence (Arévalo, Kaffenberger, and de Montesquiou 2018). In Bangladesh, BRAC
encourages village community organizations that bring women together to exercise
their collective voice and action and achieve empowerment in their communities to
enable women to organize and mobilize in the public space. Meanwhile, JEEViKA,
in Bihar, India, has created a federation of self-help groups.
Economic inclusion programs can have unintended adverse impacts. By making
women primary beneficiaries, some programs may reinforce traditional gender roles
or increase women’s work burden by requiring them to attend project activities
and manage microenterprises on top of their usual care responsibilities (Yoong,
Rabinovich, and Diepeveen 2012, World Bank 2014, Van den Bold, Quisumbing,
87

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

and Gillespie 2013). Program design and delivery may exacerbate tensions among
household members (Pavanello et al. 2018). In Zambia, for example, interviewed
beneficiaries complained about the challenge of balancing training attendance with
care and income-generating activities. As a result, the project adjusted the timing
of program activities to ensure time-consuming activities, such as life and business
skills trainings, did not overlap with intensive agricultural periods, such as planting
or harvesting. However, “time poverty” among women is a deeply contextual issue.
In Afghanistan, both the primary women beneficiaries and other women in the
household were found to have an excess amount of available time. The increased
labor for women that came from Afghanistan’s Targeting the Ultra Poor program had
positive employment outcomes without generating additional stress for the women
involved (Bedoya Arguelles et al. 2019).
Although not a common risk, cash transfers can in some cases increase intimatepartner violence due to the women’s engagement in economic activities being
perceived as a threat to traditional masculinity and gender roles in the household
(Prevention Collaborative 2019; Buller et al. 2018). It is as crucial to engage men to
mitigate this risk as it is to change cultural norms more broadly. The GEWEL program
in Zambia is partnering with BRAC to incorporate proven interventions in this space,
including couples training and gender dialogue at the community level. Putting in place
gender-sensitive grievance redress mechanisms, such as multiple reporting channels,
including anonymous reporting and reporting through trusted focal points. A genderbased violence referral system can also play an important prevention and response role.
Measuring women’s economic empowerment is challenging. In Afghanistan,
an early evaluation of the Targeting the Ultra Poor program was found to have no
impact on gender outcomes when using an index focused on household finances and
expenditures, such as that used in the original graduation research per Banerjee et al.
(2015). However, after constructing a broader index, the program was found to lead
to significant increases in women’s empowerment. Women’s power over decisionmaking about their own bodies and over how they use their time was stronger, and
there was an increase in their participation in income-generating activities as a result
of participating in the program. They had greater political involvement and improved
social capital as represented by their having identity cards and reaching out to
community leaders (Bedoya Arguelles et al. 2019).2 This is an important argument for
the need to broaden the scope of measurement tools to include different empowerment
dimensions in addition to financial decision-making when assessing the gender
impacts of economic inclusion programs. A new generation of impact evaluations is in
the pipeline that will use a broader set of indicators to examine different dimensions
of women’s empowerment, including intrahousehold decision-making, self-esteem,
psychosocial well-being, and social capital.

Future Directions
Significant efforts to build women’s economic empowerment are already under way,
and early evidence suggests that when carefully designed with a gender-sensitive lens,
economic inclusion programs can improve women’s access to income, help them better
manage their assets, and enable them to improve their status in the household. Going
forward, greater attention is required to track and monitor the effect and impact of
program design choices. Getting households to work better together may help increase
women’s empowerment. There is also strong potential to mobilize local community
groups to further the collective strength of female beneficiaries.

Notes
1. There is still a gap of 7 percentage points between men and women when it comes to owning

a bank account (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018).
2. In Afghanistan, women’s empowerment is driven by an increase in women’s decision-making

power over their own bodies and time, an increase in their participation in income-generating
activities (which follows from the program), and an increase in political involvement and
social capital (for example, having an ID, reaching out to community leaders). See Goldstein
(2019).

CHAPTER 4
Moving to Scale through GovernmentLed Programs
KEY MESSAGES
Many government programs are at a nascent stage of scaling up. A sustainable
approach to scaling up involves careful design across several programmatic and
­institutional dimensions. This is a critical prerequisite before the expansion of program
coverage.
The Partnership for Economic Inclusion (PEI) Landscape Survey 2020 shows that
more than 50 percent of existing government-led programs have the potential to
cover between 5 and 10 percent of the extreme poor. In these, economic inclusion
programs are devised as a discrete intervention, supporting a wider set of policies.
In many instances, these programs are underpinning a push toward comprehensive
and universal social protection.
Coordination across ministries is necessary to link different complementary
programs. Complementarities and convergences help single-ministry programs achieve
economies of scale in implementation and strengthen policy coherence.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Documentation of effective operational models and delivery systems in different
contexts is required to facilitate effective design and coordination of economic inclusion programming. A wide range of possible configurations of partners, programs, and
structures is under way, but there are gaps in documentation and guidance.
Leveraging existing digital infrastructure is critical to strengthen program management and increase efficiency. Digital solutions can help leapfrog some delivery
constraints and increase cost-effectiveness, and they will grow in prominence as social
distancing restrictions affect training and coaching activities in the wake of the COVID19 crisis.
Market and value chains links can increase the productivity of livelihood activities
and bolster program sustainability. Mesolevel links will help alleviate difficult access
to markets, infrastructure, and production inputs, and the potential for increased private
sector engagement is high.

Introduction

G

lobal discourse on reaching scale with economic inclusion programs is often
limited to expanding the number of people served. Yet there are a number of
other dimensions of scaling up that need to be factored in for government-led
economic inclusion programs to reach scale. This ­chapter explores the programmatic
and institutional aspects of moving to scale. The discussion builds on the political
economy discussions in chapter 2.1
Many government-led programs are in their infancy, while others are only in early
stages of scaling up. As noted in chapter 1, economic inclusion programs at scale tend
to be incorporated into broader policy and programming.
As programs mature, it will be important to document and learn from the different
ways governments increase coverage and adapt their design and delivery to do so,
based on their contexts, maturity of the social protection and other government
systems, and level of decentralization. The process will also be influenced locally by
how governments are set up, which ministries hold the institutional mandate for social
protection, whether a coordination mechanism exists or needs to be created, and a
myriad of other contextual considerations. In the years to come, process documentation
and operational research will be essential to build a body of knowledge and guidance
on how to bring economic inclusion programs most efficiently to scale.
To achieve economic inclusion “at scale,” several programmatic and institutional
mechanics needed to embed programs in government systems must be considered
together with political economy considerations. Table 4.1 outlines the programmatic,
institutional, and policy dimensions of scale explored in this report. It is implicit in
this framework that implementing at scale requires a systemic and iterative process of
adaptation across several dimensions—in program dimensions such as layering of new

activities and components, in institutional dimensions such as budgeting, financing,
and evolution of digital platforms, to name a few.2
Moving to scale will require progress on several dimensions, some of which may be
considered important prerequisites to test and adapt before expanding the case load of
beneficiaries. A program that has included more people through expansion of coverage
geographically may have also implemented system-level changes in government policy,
perhaps in partnership with various partners to expand capacity.
In practice, scaling up will be supported through a number of customized
programmatic arrangements (FAO 2018; Slater et al. 2016; Soares et al. 2017; Tirivayi,
Knowles, and Davis 2013; Maldonado et al. 2016). In an ideal world, economic
inclusion programs would be customized and coherent in the context of national policy,
organized to overlap and converge with other related programs, and pursued with clear
and effective targeting. In practice, economic inclusion programs tend to fall under
either of two approaches: single or complementary. A single approach is achieved when
additional components are added to a program. This is typical in low-capacity settings,
newly initiated approaches, or where government coordination may be especially
challenging. A complementary approach coordinates across different programs with
a common objective. Complementary approaches are more typical where programs
advance and mature or where systems are better established for such coordination.

Programmatic Adaptations to Scale
In order to reach scale, economic inclusion programs need to adapt along a range
of programmatic dimensions, including the increase of beneficiary coverage and the
expansion of program functions. Among government-led programs, coverage remains
modest, but more than one-third of government programs have recently undergone
functional expansion, most commonly among social safety net (SSN) programs. Many
economic inclusion programs have the potential to scale up.
Increasing coverage refers to scaling-up programs to include more people or
communities in a given location or replicating the program in different locations.
Beyond coverage expansion, programmatic adaptations to scale up often also involve
functional scaling up—increasing the scope of activity, where initially a program starts
with a single focus but then layers on or links additional multisectoral interventions.

Increased Coverage
At present, 95 government-led programs in the Partnership for Economic Inclusion
(PEI) Landscape Survey 2020—those that shared the number of current beneficiaries—
serve over 18 million households, or more than 85 million individuals. This represents
an overwhelming majority of the total beneficiaries reached by economic inclusion
programs globally (93 percent of both households and individuals).3
In terms of the different entry points to scaling up, among government programs,
45 percent of programs featured in the report are classified as SSN programs.4 SSN
programs in the PEI Landscape Survey 2020 account for 58 percent of the total
­individuals reached, while livelihoods and jobs (L&J) programs make up 53 percent of
government-led programs and account for 42 percent of total individuals reached.5
Given the targeted nature of economic inclusion programs, the analysis considers
“coverage equivalents” across different thresholds—the national poverty line, the extreme
poverty line, and the Multidimensional Poverty Index—with each metric providing
varying perspectives around poverty.6 For instance, in Bangladesh, coverage rates of
government-led programs are 3 percent relative to total population, 12 percent relative
94

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

to poverty (as measured by the national poverty line), 20 percent relative to extreme
poverty, and 7 percent relative to multidimensional poverty. Note that while the overall
analysis covers 53 countries, some metrics report fewer, owing to data gaps. Box 4.1
provides an overview of the methodological approaches in estimating coverage of
economic inclusion programs, combined with the challenges that may limit this analysis.
The coverage of government-led programs appears modest relative to total population
size but slightly higher when comparing the number of beneficiaries to various poverty
lines; in any case, in most contexts there is great potential to scale up.7 Just one
individual program, the Tanzania Productive Social Safety Net, serves slightly more than
10 percent of Tanzania’s population. The program scale-up was driven by a strong policy
initiative to increase outreach and an effort to decentralize program delivery, which led
to broad national coverage. The majority of individual programs serve less than 1 percent
of their country’s total population (see figure 4.1, panel a). When individual programs
are aggregated at the country level—and assuming no overlapping beneficiaries among

BOX 4.1

Estimating Coverage of Economic Inclusion Programs

For this report—based on the Partnership for Economic Inclusion (PEI) Landscape
Survey 2020—the “coverage” of a country’s economic inclusion programs is considered to be the number of beneficiaries reached by all its programs relative to the total
population. The estimates delineate coverage in terms of households (direct beneficiaries) and individuals (direct plus indirect beneficiaries). The individual figure is determined by multiplying direct beneficiaries by average household size. This follows an
accepted estimation approach across social protection programs globally (Milazzo and
Grosh 2008; Beegle et al. 2018). Estimates do not account for the potential spillover
and community effects of an intervention.
Given the tailored nature of economic inclusion programs, the report also considers
“coverage equivalents,” defined as the number of direct plus indirect beneficiaries
reached by a program relative to the total population and estimated poverty thresholds, including the national poverty line, extreme poverty line, and the Multidimensional
Poverty Index. These equivalent measures provide important illustrations of the potential coverage of programs that have a strong poverty focus. They also recognize a wider
debate on poverty measurement thresholds. However, the approach has shortcomings.
The program data provided for this study do not capture beneficiary welfare, so the
study could not identify whether reported beneficiaries are poor or not. At best, these
figures show the potential scale of programs, if they were perfectly targeted.
Broadly speaking, three challenges limit the analysis: First, there are data gaps, so the
information presented should be considered as a lower-bound estimate; just 201 out
of 219 programs reported beneficiary data. This points to obvious monitoring gaps in
program implementation. Second, in conducting this study, PEI drew on census information to determine average household size. This may underestimate the true nature
of coverage, since poorer households are usually larger than average. Also, this level of
disaggregated information was not systematically available for all countries. Third, PEI did
not account for potential overlaps across programs. To minimize the risk of overlap, PEI
cross-checked its own survey data with government administrative data, when possible,
and made the decision to report on individuals, whether indirect or direct beneficiaries.

programs—22 out of 53 countries have coverage of between 1 and 5 percent of the total
population, as shown in figure 4.1, panel b.
The scale of economic inclusion interventions is modest in part because they
began recently and in part because they are most relevant for the poorest subset of
the population. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have a large number of people
living in poverty, which offers great potential to scale up. Although there is a good
base of economic inclusion programs operating in many countries in these regions,
the aggregated coverage of programs in the majority of these countries ranges from
1 to 5 percent. Four countries in Sub-Saharan Africa—Ethiopia, Sudan, Tanzania, and
Uganda—have programs that build on SSN systems and have managed to achieve
coverage greater than 5 percent.
However, expressed as a share of the extreme poor, coverage is slightly higher. The
PEI Landscape Survey 2020 shows that 21 countries have the potential to cover between 5
percent and 10 percent of the extreme poor through a combination of existing programs.
This presentation of a coverage “equivalent” to extreme poverty provides a more accurate
reflection of program objectives and approaches. Economic inclusion programs are
devised as discrete interventions, supporting a wider set of policies. In many instances
these programs are underpinning a push to comprehensive and universal social
protection. As highlighted in box 4.1, although the analysis highlights gaps in coverage,
there are strong methodological challenges and assumptions embedded in it.
Many government-led programs surveyed are in the process of expanding coverage,
and there is a strong potential to scale up. Fifty-seven percent of these have expanded
coverage in the past two years by adding more beneficiaries in a province, region,
and/or district or across the country. At present, only 15 percent of governmentled programs surveyed operate in a single state or region, while 59 percent serve
beneficiaries in multiple states or regions, and a further 26 percent operate nationally.
Geographic expansion is largely dependent upon a country’s administrative structure
and the physical location of target populations. While it is too early to identify trends
in economic inclusion programming, there is some evidence that governments are
incorporating nongovernment-led programs, which could lead to increased coverage
of beneficiaries. For example, in Ethiopia from 2009 to 2011, a small pilot project
implemented by the Relief Society of Tigray in the north served as the basis for
the design of the government’s Household Asset Building Program, which aimed
to enhance the productive capacity of the poorest recipients of the public works
productive safety net program (PSNP).

Functional Expansion
In the PEI survey, more than a third of the cohort of government-led programs had
undergone functional expansion (enhancement of the scope of their activities) in the
past two years, often in conjunction with coverage expansion. Scope enhancement was
somewhat more common among SSN programs (44 percent) than among L&J programs
(26 percent). This is consistent with a growing emphasis on supplementing SSNs with
livelihood interventions.
Expanding the scope of a single program is usually a gradual process, with many
programs starting with a base intervention and gradually layering interventions.
For example, building resilience to climate change became a key rationale for
Sahel governments to enhance the scope of their SSNs with elements of adaptive
social protection, including economic inclusion (see case study 1). The bundling
of multisectoral interventions, a fundamental feature of economic inclusion
programming, requires significant administrative capacity. Most SSN programs have
added components gradually; in Côte d’Ivoire the Productive Social Safety Net project
97

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

provided cash transfers to poor households in the first year of operation, introducing
additional livelihood interventions only in its third year (World Bank 2015).
While a number of livelihood programs have managed to implement a suite of
interventions, others have taken a phased approach to manage complexity at scale.
For instance, in India, programs like the Andhra Pradesh Inclusive Growth Project
(AGRIGP) and the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project, or JEEViKA, focused initially on
developing self-help groups and other community-based organizations to promote
financial inclusion. In later years, these programs progressively added skills training,
livelihood support, and links.
Some programs are expanding the scope of their interventions in response to
changing needs and contexts. Several programs reported their plans for increased
emphasis on resilience, including SSN programs like the upcoming Mali Access to
Finance and Income Generating Opportunities Project. Other programs increased their
emphasis on market development, including L&J programs like Argentina’s Proyecto
de inclusión socio-económica en áreas rurales, Bolivia’s Rural Alliances Project, and
India’s AGRIGP for small farmers and producers.
In certain countries, functional expansion takes the form of program convergence,
in which components of two or more existing discrete programs serve the same group
of beneficiaries. For instance, in Brazil, the Acre Social and Economic Inclusion and
Sustainable Development Project provides coordinated interventions to the poor in one
state, including cash transfers (Bolsa Família), health, agroforestry production systems, and
agricultural extension services (World Bank 2008). Similarly, in India, JEEViKA leverages its
community-based structure to link participants to SSN, agriculture, enterprise development,
skills training, and financial inclusion programs. In Panama, the pilot Productive Inclusion
Program in indigenous territories is part of broader economic inclusion programming
and is linked with the cash transfer program Red de Oportunidades. Ideally, this type of
complementary program would introduce links and referrals across existing programs. This
type of link would ideally help improve existing delivery platforms. In practice, however,
varying levels of policy coherence and coordination determine whether this approach is
effective in delivering a suite of interventions.

Institutional Adaptations to Scale
Institutional, policy, strategy, organizational, and operational settings influence whether
an economic inclusion program scales up or not. Today, through system-level changes,
such as in policy or budgeting, small-scale programs are being institutionalized.
Institutionalization might happen by including a small-scale pilot or program in
government policy and financing, expanding organizational capacity (either in-house
or through partnerships), or building delivery systems or utilizing existing systems,
depending on the context. An example of institutionalization is the Adaptive Social
Protection Program in the Sahel. This program was launched in March 2014 to support
the design and implementation of adaptive social protection programs and systems
in six Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal).
The program entails a combination of policies and interventions to help poor and
vulnerable households build resilience, reduce the impact of climatic change and
other shocks, and foster access to income-earning opportunities. The social protection
programs use existing SSNs as a base on which to build complementary activities, with
a strong focus on training in basic skills and livelihood diversification, sanitary and
health practices, and nutrition awareness.
A number of small-scale pilots or programs, including those led by
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), are also being institutionalized through
policy, programming, legal, budgetary, or other system-level changes. For example,
98

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

the organization Fonkoze has institutionalized the Chemin Lavi Miyò program in Haiti
as the primary way to work with poorest beneficiaries. As their incomes and assets
grow, participants can access some of the organization’s other services, in particular,
microfinance. And the Ghana Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) program builds
on a series of smaller pilots, including one that for almost a decade has been testing
ways to increase access to income-generating activities for extremely poor households.
This process of institutionalization helps expand the understanding of scaling-up
beyond just programmatic aspects and acknowledges that institutional and political
settings influence whether a program will scale up or not. Organizational capacity and
robust delivery systems are also critical dimensions of effective scale up.

Policy and Strategy Adaptations
Economic inclusion programs often have a strong link to national policy and strategy
frameworks. Seventy-six percent of the programs in the survey are integrated with a
government program or a government strategy or policy pertaining to growth, poverty
reduction, social protection and labor, migration and forced displacement, recovery and
resilience, or agriculture and rural development. Ministries that typically lead government
economic inclusion programs are ministries of development and planning (17 percent),
ministries of social development and protection (26 percent), labor (15 percent), agriculture
(12 percent), finance (9 percent), and environment (6 percent).
In the past two years, 33 percent of government-led programs surveyed have
adapted institutionalization structures, illustrating the current policy momentum for
this agenda. Programs that are scaling up institutionally are often strongly linked to
national policy and strategy frameworks. For example, the Satat Jeevikoparjan Yojana
(SJY) scale-up in Bihar, India, as highlighted in case study 2, benefits from being
integrated into a larger institutionalized economic inclusion effort: JEEViKA at the
state level and the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) at the national level.
SJY is strongly aligned to state- and national-level policy objectives and is considered
a key piece of JEEViKA’s overall policy goal of “saturation,” that is, inclusion of and
service provision for the poor. SJY’s scale-up benefits from state and national funding,
and JEEViKA’s well-developed and adaptive delivery systems and infrastructure, all
of which have supported an altogether new programmatic approach. NRLM, having
been conceptualized at the national level based on the lessons of JEEViKA and similar
programs in other states, offers a broad landscape in which to institutionalize the
experiences of SJY at a national scale.
Rwanda’s Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme (VUP), introduced in 2008, combines
public works with financial support in the form of transfers, financial literacy training,
and credit. There was strong high-level commitment to the program, which was due
to the convergence of interests around the view that persistent poverty and inequality
directly created political instability. As a result, the VUP became an integral part of the
government’s development strategy, with public financing constituting a significant
portion of the cost and expanding program coverage to roughly 6 percent of the population
(Lavers 2016). Approximately 45 percent of programs led by the ministries of labor and
development and planning have adapted institutional structures in the process of scale-up.
Financing is an important part of sustainability, and it links to political economy
decisions, discussed in chapter 2. Over half (55 percent) of programs surveyed led by
governments are also funded in whole (29 percent of these) or in part (71 percent) by
them, with 36 countries having dedicated budget lines for expenditures in this area.
Furthermore, the majority of programs in ministries of labor (69 percent of governmentled programs), agriculture (58 percent), development and planning (61 percent),
and social development and protection (60 percent) have a dedicated budget line
99

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

for economic inclusion programming. This demonstrates a high level of government
ownership and commitment to this agenda. For example, Peru’s Haku Wiñay is a
government-funded program with an established budgetary line and resources offering
greater fiscal continuity. As a result, it has been institutionalizing as it rolled out
systematically to different parts of Peru over the years (see case study 4). Survey data
disaggregated by region reveal that 92 percent of programs in Latin America and the
Caribbean receive government funding, whereas in Sub-Saharan Africa only about
31 percent receive government funding. Of those government-led programs that have
institutionalized in the past two years, 63 percent have received government funding. In
terms of entry points to scale, 56 percent of SSN and 54 percent of L&J programs have
acquired government funding.
At the same time, donor financing has an important role to play, both by filling
financing gaps and because of the associated technical expertise that accompanies such
financing. The funding that underpins the efforts of those programs surveyed is often
provided by a mix of donors, the most prevalent being multilateral agencies, which
fund most economic inclusion programs (71 percent of all programs and 79 percent of
government-led programs), including the World Bank, multilateral organizations such as
the European Union and United Nations agencies, and bilateral agencies like the United
Kingdom’s Department for International Development, the US Agency for International
Development, Ireland’s IrishAID, and Germany’s Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale
Zusammenarbeit (GIZ).8 The World Bank is financing 37 percent of all economic inclusion
programs, mostly government-led programs.9 For example, in Bihar the national and state
governments, World Bank, catalytic philanthropic funding for technical assistance, and
research support have combined synergistically to support SJY (see case study 2).

Organizational Adaptations
Most programs that have expanded in size and scope have also expanded their
organizational capacity. Bundling multisectoral interventions requires that all the
government agencies involved have significant administrative capacity and clear
institutional mandates. Over the past two years, 41 percent of government programs
surveyed have expanded their organizational capacity. This might be by increasing in-house
capacity or through partnerships with other institutions, depending on the context. In
Peru, the Haku Wiñay program uses expert farmers called yachachiq, who advise and help
the program participants in the improvements of their farming techniques. The profile
of these yachachiq varies from region to region, but they are often young peasants who
have previously worked in NGO projects or in other social programs and therefore can
provide advice and guidance to their neighbors. Their presence in the communities has
alleviated the need to identify or procure a third-party partner organization to deliver the
coaching component (see case study 4). Although it is an NGO program, Fonkoze in Haiti
provides an interesting example of organizational scaling. Fonkoze determined that safe
housing was an essential part of their Chemen Lavi Miyò economic inclusion program
because leaky roofs hindered the economic progress of beneficiaries. The organization’s
entrepreneurial culture led them to offer construction training and deliver basic materials
to participants despite those elements not being initially part of the organization’s mandate
(de Montesquiou and Sheldon 2018).
Economic inclusion packages are bundled together in different ways: some bundles
are provided by one program only (single programs) while other bundles are knitted
together by linking several programs (complementary programs). Roughly 76 percent of
government-led programs in the survey are single programs. In some instances, single
programs may also choose to refer program participants to additional services provided
by organizations outside the program, such as referring people for health care provision,
100

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

but the core economic inclusion package is still provided through the program, including
through partner organizations. Among government programs, 69 percent of SSN programs
and 81 percent of L&J programs are single programs in the survey.
Complementary programs face the challenges of policy coherence in program
design and effective coordination during implementation. In most cases, despite stated
intentions and agreements, the synergies between programs are typically not well
articulated in policy, program design, or implementation. Some countries are working
to deepen coordination across programs, as Brazil did with its Brasil Sem Miséria
program, in which respective ministries had integrated their registries to achieve
better joint-targeting programs, such as the Bolsa Família (conditional cash transfer),
Promotion of Rural Productive Activities (Fomento cash grant), the Bolsa Verde (grants
in the Amazon forest), and Cisternas (access to water facilitation to rural activities).10
The majority of complementary programs in the survey are led by governments
(57 percent). These are coordinated interventions built on existing systems and
programs, which may be helping to avoid duplication of government interventions
and to improve efficiencies. In many cases, despite good intentions and formalized
agreements, coordination between programs remains difficult: governments need to
focus on strengthening operational capacity and effective coordination in order to
do this effectively (GIZ 2017). In Chile, the Ministry of Social Development takes the
lead in coordinating the delivery of a range of social services and benefits provided
by different government institutions under the Programa Familias for the poorest
and most vulnerable. In Indonesia, the Ministry of Social Affairs is also working to
integrate its poverty-targeted programs. Selected recipients of Indonesia’s conditional
cash transfer program (Program Keluarga Harapan) are encouraged to join either the
Kelompok Usaha Bersama Program (a business entrepreneurship program through
which families receive support to set up sustainable microenterprises) or the new social
entrepreneurship program Kewirausahaan Sosial or both. The goal is to create a ladder
of support to foster the further development of microbusinesses with higher potential.
Forging partnerships with NGOs and the private sector (including financial
services providers) for program delivery is critically important for economic inclusion
programs. Box 4.2 discusses some of the key roles NGOs play in program design and
implementation. The complexity of bundled interventions makes it difficult for a single
agency to deliver them. It is also inefficient for a single agency to do so, except in
fragile or conflict- or violence-affected settings, where there are serious service delivery
gaps. Among the government-led programs in the survey, 67 percent partner with NGOs
and 63 percent with the private sector for implementation, financing, and technical
support. Eighty-seven percent of government programs surveyed are supported by
donors (such as the World Bank). The most common roles for NGO and private
sector partners are providing technical assistance and the delivery of components.
Regular performance evaluation of partners such as NGOs and private sector service
providers is an essential part of efficient implementation and can be nurtured through
performance-based contracting.
Lead organizations often partner with other organizations or actors to implement
program components, bring in specialized expertise, and overcome capacity constraints.
These partners are mostly NGOs, community members, and governments at different
levels. In Brazil, the World Bank–supported Bahia Sustainable Rural Development
Project is working to scale up productive alliances, better integrate with the market at
both the private and institutional levels, and strengthen the contribution of other public
sector institutions and policies. In the Sahel, the governments partnered with Trickle Up
both for the design of the program and for the delivery phase, sometimes also including
communities through group formations and community agents to deliver the programs.
Government-led programs may rely more on other implementing partners than
nongovernment-led programs. This is partly because national governments may
101

BOX 4.2

Beyond Direct Delivery: NGOs as Catalyzers for Scale

Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) implement nearly half of all economic inclusion
programs worldwide, but serve only 7 percent of beneficiaries. However, coverage data must
not minimize the critical role NGOs play in the scaling up of economic inclusion programs.
First, some NGOs directly implement programs at a very large scale. Examples include
BRAC’s Ultra-Poor Graduation Program, Village Enterprise’s Kenya Core Programming, and
World Vision’s Livelihood Technical Program. This is true especially in fragile and conflictor violence-affected settings, as is the case with Concern Worldwide’s Building Resilient
Communities in Somalia, and Humanity and Inclusion’s Alliance for Community Resilience
program (with a consortium of seven NGOs) in West Africa.
Program design support. Beyond direct implementation, there are several roles that
NGOs play. They provide extensive support to the design of government programs with
technical assistance. This provision of multiyear technical support and capacity building to
governments is accelerating the pace at which governments are adopting economic inclusion programs and is catalyzing a new wave of adaptive learning.
Program delivery support. NGOs also frequently support governments in delivering economic
inclusion programs: 67 percent of governments surveyed partner with NGOs for this purpose.
Depending on government capacity levels in a country, NGOs may take on different parts of
program delivery. For example, in the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program, Trickle Up
helps the government hire and train frontline staff in some regions, while directly implementing
coaching components in lower-capacity regions. In Bihar, the Indian NGO Bandhan Konnagar
provides technical support to JEEViKA, the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project, to help it adapt and
roll out the approach of Satat Jeevikoparjan Yojana (SJY). Both examples are highlighted in this
publication’s case studies.
Documenting and testing innovations. When providing technical assistance or implementing programs, NGOs are often at the forefront of documenting country-level innovations, helping to fill some global knowledge gaps. Some NGOs are testing innovations
aimed at right-sizing economic inclusion package components. For example, in Kenya,
Village Enterprise has recently completed a randomized controlled trial demonstrating successful results of a low-cost economic inclusion package. The BOMA Project and
Concern Worldwide are testing innovations in delivery mechanisms in East Africa. Such
lessons are critical to helping governments around the globe adapt programs to their
country context and their current and expected future fiscal space.
Building capacity. NGOs often help to build capacity in the government programs they
support through design, delivery, and technical assistance. BRAC, Fundación Capital,
Trickle Up, and other providers of technical assistance to governments play a key role in
delivering training and drafting tools and technical guides to help governments in their
economic inclusion programming.
Pioneering new funding mechanisms. Finally, by pioneering innovative funding mechanisms, some NGOs are engaging new funders in the field. For example, in 2017, Village
Enterprise mobilized funding for an economic inclusion program through a development
impact bond in Uganda. This pioneering effort was followed by significant investment from
various donors and philanthropists, who were keen to learn about the effectiveness of
outcome-based funding mechanisms to leverage additional funding for scaling up. More
work is needed in terms of understanding how government systems can make use of
these new funding mechanisms.

not be best suited to beneficiary-level work. In fact, they often rely on regional
and local governments, NGOs, or private-sector organizations to undertake the
program activities that involve individual beneficiaries, such as program targeting,
delivery of program components, and beneficiary monitoring.11 Figure 4.2 offers
a breakdown of the roles played by the lead government agency and partner
organizations in government-led programs.

Operational Adaptations
To reduce cost and facilitate links with other social policy, a number of economic
inclusion programs leverage existing delivery systems (see chapter 6). Thirtythree percent of all programs surveyed and 43 percent of government-led programs
are currently utilizing government social registries, beneficiary registries, and other
government databases to identify program participants. Among government-led
programs, this is more common in programs operating in the regions of Latin America
and the Caribbean and South Asia (62 percent and 40 percent, respectively) than it is
in those in Sub-Saharan Africa (27 percent). Using a government registry is also more
common in government programs that have an SSN as an entry point (58 percent) than
in those with L&J as the entry point (32 percent). In addition, government programs
use information systems across the program delivery chain to advance implementation
on the ground and support overall program management (figure 4.3, panel a).
Digital technology is utilized in 85 percent of all government-led programs
surveyed.12 Data digitization increases transparency and accountability in service

as important in Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Government complementary programs are more likely than single interventions,
among those surveyed, to leverage digital technologies for overall program management
and monitoring (77 percent and 63 percent, respectively). Information systems also
facilitate information exchange and coordinated delivery across government agencies
and nongovernment implementing partners. This is vitally important for economic
inclusion programs that combine multiple interventions. However, the use of digital
technologies also poses new challenges in terms of building capacity, integrating
information systems, and ensuring data protection.
Apart from aiding management and monitoring, digital technology plays a growing
role in the direct delivery of services. Thirty percent of government-led programs use
digital technology to deliver at least one intervention, such as electronic payments,
digital financial services, e-coaching, and e-training (see figure 4.3, panel b). With the
exception of skills training, government programs use digital technologies at higher
rates than nongovernment programs, especially in delivering transfers or financial
support, access to savings, and market information.
The rapid diffusion of new mobile and internet technologies also presents an
opportunity to utilize technological innovations to reach beneficiaries. However,
­digital divides may remain across location, income groups, gender, and age; economic
104

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

inclusion beneficiaries are less likely to be connected or familiar with digital interfaces.
The use of technology needs to be balanced with the need to reach those offline.

Operations: Leveraging Community Structures for Program Delivery
Seventy-three percent of government-led programs included in the survey utilize
community structures, including local governance groups (65 percent), formalized
producer organizations (53 percent), and informal community savings and credit
groups (39 percent). Community structures may be engaged in program delivery,
including for training, coaching, and savings facilitation (see figure 4.4). Whether
the economic inclusion programs are primarily at the household or individual level,
community mobilization components allow programs to build agency and to support
program implementation. Engaging the community in a program’s implementation
can help generate change at the community level. By creating opportunities for social
interaction, programs build social capital and influence attitudes and behaviors across
social and economic domains. This potentially can generate spillover effects for the
broader community, amplifying and sustaining program impact. When the poor have
limited social networks to start with, interventions that support the formation of peer
groups, profitable social bonds, and cooperative arrangements can yield concrete
economic returns (Macours and Vakis 2014; Blattman et al. 2016).
Eighty-six percent of government programs that leverage community structures
also support the development of these community platforms, either by developing
new structures or strengthening existing ones. Government programs that support
the development of producer organizations in their efforts to integrate participants
with markets are more likely to leverage community structures than programs that
do not (94 percent versus 68 percent). For example, JEEViKA relies on a large cadre
of community members trained to support programming efforts. These grassroots
women leaders serve as paraprofessionals, resource persons, and functionaries trained
in the areas of institutional capacity building, community mobilizing, bookkeeping,
and providing links with commercial banks and livelihood support services.13

Village organizations enable JEEViKA to extend a host of livelihood supports,
including grants to support farmer producer groups mobilized across self-help groups,
community-level poultry units, and greenhouses. They also enable initiatives to
promote community health; water access, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices;
and a host of other services (see case study 2). In Peru, Haku Wiñay is implemented
with the support of executing nuclei—groups of 80 to 100 rural households. The nuclei
have communal legitimacy because they are integrated with and directed by members
of the community (see case study 4).

Future Directions
Many government-led economic inclusion programs are at a nascent stage of
implementation and must refine their policies and strategies in order to scale up.
Scaling up entails not just a simple increase in coverage but a flexible process by
which governments develop economic inclusion programs along programmatic and
institutional priorities. There are multiple dimensions to consider in order to reach
scale; understanding this can dramatically increase the number of people served.
The number of participants served will grow as national economic inclusion
programs scale up, but they will eventually plateau, because the programs are designed
to serve a subset of the population. These programs are only a part of a wider set of a
government policy and underpin a push toward comprehensive and universal social
protection. Despite the growth in economic inclusion programming by governments,
the scale of these programs is still relatively small compared to need. At present,
the PEI survey shows over 50 percent of existing government-led programs have the
potential to cover 5 percent to 10 percent of the extreme poor.
Coordination across ministries is necessary to link complementary programs.
Complementarities and convergences help single-ministry programs to achieve
economies of scale in implementation and strengthen policy coherence. Bundling
interventions requires significant administrative capacity, and most programs that
have expanded in size and scope have also expanded their organizational capacity.
Programmatic adaptations are typically accompanied by some form of institutional
adaptation. Depending on context, these include small-scale pilots or programs in
government policy and financing, expanding organizational capacity (either in-house or
through partnerships), and building delivery systems or leveraging existing systems.
Successful government-led interventions require strong local partnerships.
Documentation of good practice in effective government-NGO collaboration can
catalyze innovation and learning. Forty-one percent of government programs have
expanded their organizational capacity over the past two years, for example, by
increasing in-house capacity through partnerships with other institutions. Community
structures may be engaged in program delivery, including for training, coaching, and
savings facilitation.
Documentation of effective operational models and delivery systems in different
contexts is required to facilitate effective design and coordination of economic
inclusion programming. With a wide range of possible configurations of partners,
programs, and structures under way, documentation and guidance is a gap.
Documenting the programmatic and operational lessons from these government
programs as they scale up will allow for an increased understanding of how to
efficiently reach scale depending on context, administrative structure, capacity, and
fiscal resources.
Leveraging existing digital infrastructure is critical to strengthen program
management and increase efficiency. Digital solutions can help leapfrog some delivery
constraints and increase cost-effectiveness, and they will grow in prominence as
106

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

social distancing restrictions affect training and coaching activities in the wake of the
COVID-19 crisis. Thirty percent of government-led programs provide access to program
components through digital platforms, but digital divides still remain across location,
income groups, gender, and age.
Market and value chain links can increase productivity of livelihood activities
and bolster program sustainability. Mesolevel links will help alleviate difficult
access to markets, infrastructure, and production inputs, and the potential for
increased private sector engagement is high. Moving forward it will be important to
understand how L&J interventions can be further scaled up, reducing the barriers
for very poor and vulnerable people to enter job markets. Community-based
development approaches and other sectoral interventions (such as agricultural
development programs) might also provide opportunities to foster synergies among
poverty reduction programs.

9. Much of the World Bank financing is in the form of loans to governments, thus this figure
also includes funding that will ultimately be provided to the beneficiaries by the recipient
governments. The World Bank is made up of the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). These two
institutions provide different types of lending instruments to countries based on income
category. IBRD lends to governments of middle-income and creditworthy low-income
countries. IDA provides interest-free loans—called credits—and grants to governments of
the poorest countries. On occasion, countries may be eligible to receive financing from
both lending sources, called blended finance. Of World Bank–financed economic inclusion
programs, 57 percent are IDA, 29 percent are IBRD, and 12 percent are blended. The remaining
2 percent of programs are in locations that do not fit into a lending category: West Bank and
Gaza, Cyprus, and Sint Maarten (Dutch part).

Dilma Rousseff in 2016.
11. The survey asked programs to indicate which organizations, apart from the lead organization,
perform the main roles. There were initially significant errors and inconsistencies in how
programs responded to these questions. While the Partnership for Economic Inclusion
management team followed up with programs to clarify some of these issues, this section
presents broad trends rather than actual percentages, as these may not accurately represent
the extent to which different organizations play the various roles captured through the survey.

SPOTLIGHT 3

Linking Economic Inclusion and
Markets for the Poorest
While economic inclusion programs typically seek to address the multiple constraints
that poor households confront, it is increasingly important for these programs to
address constraints beyond the household. These include underlying factors that
constrain opportunities for local economic growth, such as proximity to physical
markets, regional market depth, access to connective infrastructure, and production.
Strengthening links to markets for inputs, labor, goods, and services is important to
alleviate spatial-based poverty and to increase income-generating opportunities for the
extreme poor and vulnerable. Although this is an area of considerable interest, it is a
relatively new frontier for many programs featured in this review.
As many of the world’s extreme poor live in isolated, rural localities where access
to markets is limited, there is an immediate interest in understanding rural market
dynamics and strategies to link households to local, regional, and international
markets. A vibrant rural sector requires not only that stakeholders support productive
markets but also that they prioritize small rural producers, resilience building, and the
enhancement of the economic and productive capacity of the rural poor (FAO 2017).
Such efforts entail working with key market players to improve interaction and
negotiation with informal workers, producers, and entrepreneurs. Furthermore,
to develop a thriving rural sector, it is important to address the challenges and
opportunities posed by migration and rural development. Rural households and
communities can maximize the benefits of migration by enhancing and diversifying
rural employment opportunities, especially for women and youths; helping the poor to
better manage risks; and leveraging remittances for investments in the rural sector.
While economic inclusion programs have a strong rural focus, the importance
of urban market links is coming into focus. Due to limited labor demand and rising
informality in rural areas, there has been an increase in migration to urban centers,
presenting the poorest with both opportunities and challenges. By 2045, the number
of people living in cities worldwide will increase 1.5 times, to 6 billion. Demand for
food will grow by an estimated 70 percent from 2010 to 2050, and 83 percent of that
growth is expected to be in urban markets (World Bank 2019). In urban areas, it is
especially important to look beyond household-level constraints and link economic
inclusion interventions with economic sectors and processes that present economic
growth opportunities. This is especially true among urban agricultural markets, where
opportunities are emerging to increase off-the-farm employment in agribusiness.

Emerging Practices
Given that training and coaching play critical roles in economic inclusion programs,
these initiatives are well positioned to empower the beneficiaries of them to engage in
local markets, manage risks, and build assets. Because these programs are designed
to support people facing high levels of vulnerability, economic inclusion interventions
often aim to strengthen resilience. Such efforts include helping households stabilize
consumption and income, develop insurance mechanisms, and protect key assets.
For those people with relativity low levels of vulnerability, economic inclusion
interventions aim to promote opportunity, either through income expansion or asset
growth.

Economic inclusion programs that enhance market access follow a mix of market
integration strategies (appendix E). The Partnership for Economic Inclusion (PEI)
Landscape Survey 2020 reveals that programs facilitate access to markets by developing
producer organizations (51 percent) and provide links to service providers (67 percent)
and agricultural extension services (65 percent). In addition, as further evidenced in
the 2020 survey, programs facilitate access to improved inputs (65 percent), technology
(58 percent), and capital (39 percent). Several key interventions that address the
considerable challenges faced in linking extremely poor and vulnerable households to
markets are outlined below. Each intervention provides activities that can strengthen
both resilience and opportunity.

Linking the extreme poor to cooperatives and producer networks
Poor rural producers very often lack the capacity, or the level of organization needed,
to access formal markets in a structured way. Operating as part of a group (for example,
producer alliances, self-help groups, farmer groups, and so forth) can help overcome
these constraints and enable smallholder farmers to gain access to goods and services
previously unavailable. For example, producer alliances and cooperatives are common
tools for improving the knowledge and skills of their members in a range of activities
as well as improving access to information, helping members access lump sums of cash
through savings and/or credit, and linking producers to wider commercial networks.
Producers operating in groups have more negotiating power and access to producer-toproducer links that involve longer-term cooperative arrangements among firms that are
built on interdependence, trust, and resource pooling to jointly accomplish common
goals (USAID, FHI 360, and World Vision 2017). In Argentina, for example, the SocioEconomic Inclusion in Rural Areas Project promotes stronger formal group organization
by supporting (1) small family producers to increase their organizational capacity and
reach a minimum level of formalization and (2) groups of small family producers with
preexisting market links that could be further developed as sustainable formal links
through productive alliances. Although community networks are likely weaker in urban
contexts, some programs have shown success working in urban centers and with urban
communities (for example, in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda).

Public works development
Public works programs are important avenues for income support and shortterm employment and are featured across different economic inclusion programs
documented in the survey. Embedded in economic inclusion programs, public works
programs have the potential to address different priorities, including temporary
employment and the development of community infrastructure. Better community
infrastructure (for example, roads and irrigation systems) can increase market output,
lower transaction costs, and improve market access, thereby raising the profitability
of small producers and enterprises. Furthermore, the additional income from public
works programs enables households to accumulate savings, which can ultimately be
used for more productive investments. Income transfers that are regular and predictable
preform an insurance role, thus altering participants’ risk management capacity and
willingness to take risks (Gehrke and Hartwig 2015). While the impacts of public works
programs are heavily debated and their operation requires a great deal of capacity,
they provide an avenue for linking household and community aspects of development.
In Uganda, the Third Northern Uganda Social Action Fund aims to provide effective
income support through labor-intensive public works (LIPWs) and livelihood
111

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

investment support to build the resilience of poor and vulnerable rural households.
The LIPWs include various labor-intensive subprojects to create community assets,
including roads, other paved areas, and market shelters, to increase the accessibility of
markets and social services. In the urban context, the Urban Youth Employment Project
for Papua New Guinea incorporates an LIPW component that provides youth with
temporary employment opportunities focused on simple road maintenance, cleaning,
and environmental protection activities, including vegetation control and drain
cleaning.

Value chain development
Value chain development involves strengthening the product-to-market systems. Value
chains contain multiple stages, from preparation and distribution of primary inputs to
primary production, various processing steps, packaging, distribution, marketing, retail,
and ultimately disposal of the product. The objective of value chain programming is to
increase incentives for the links to improve performance, productivity, and trade and,
ultimately, provide poverty alleviation and economic opportunities for poor producers.
Value chain and economic inclusion interventions go hand in hand, and their symbiosis
can help create sustainability. Demand-side interventions stimulate production,
which generates job and earning opportunities for the workforce, while supply-side
interventions provide the labor that firms and other actors in the value chain require,
Box S3.1 illustrates an example.

BOX S3.1  Economic Inclusion in the Rice Value Chain: A Pilot Project
in Côte d’Ivoire
Economic opportunities for a large and diverse population in the agricultural
sector can be created through on- and off-the-farm input provision, mechanization
services, transport, processing, and distribution. The Jobs Group of the World Bank,
in partnership with the Côte d’Ivoire Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN) Project, is
piloting economic inclusion in value chains through rice value chains.
PSSN provides beneficiaries quarterly cash transfers and offers economic inclusion
activities, including formation of savings groups, entrepreneurship training, the
provision of small business grants, and coaching. For the pilot, smallholder farmers,
small- to medium-sized mills, and a national microfinance institution are collaborating
under an agreement: smallholders receive inputs on credit from the financial institution
based on having a contract with the mill to deliver a specified amount of rice of a certain
quality and at a certain price at harvest. The mill also receives working capital credit
from the microfinance institution to buy the rice at harvest and hires a liaison agent to
provide basic extension services and maintain regular contact with farmers. The World
Bank supports the platform by facilitating exchange between partners in different
localities through local and national coordinators. It also provides technical assistance
to mills and pays for an agricultural liaison officer in the microfinance institution to
reduce transaction costs.

BOX S3.2

Strengthening Environmental and Natural Resource Links

Economic inclusion programs that protect and ensure the sustainable management
of natural resources not only address pressing environmental concerns but also help
strengthen both resilience and opportunity. Often, these programs also build the
capacity of multiple stakeholders (including governments, households, communities,
and the private sector) to improve planning for more sustainable use of natural
resources in different geographic environments.
A number of these programs support investments in infrastructure and technology
to spur the development of sectors that have the potential to create environmental as
well as economic value, for example, marine fishing and agroforestry. Many programs
also support the development of value chains that are protective of the environment
and that create alternative income-generating opportunities for resource-dependent
communities, for example, value chains of nontimber forest products, such as
medicinal plants, bamboo, and honey production. As an example, the Ethiopia Resilient
Landscapes and Livelihoods Project (RLLP) aims to improve climate resilience and land
productivity and increase access to diversified livelihood activities in selected rural
watersheds. It is government-led and relies on local community structures for program
delivery. Building on lessons learned through implementation of the World Bank’s
Sustainable Land Management Project, the RLLP will complement core investments
in watershed restoration with a set of associated activities supporting sustainable
livelihoods. Activities include funding community-level green infrastructure, introducing
climate-smart agriculture (CSA), improving land tenure, and encouraging new incomegenerating activities through community groups and links to value chains.

Natural resource management
The risk of climate change and other environmental shocks creates barriers to market
access for the extreme poor. The integration of climate and disaster risk considerations
in the planning and design of economic inclusion programs will help prevent poor
and vulnerable households from falling deeper in poverty, reduce their overall
exposure to potential risk, and contribute to long-term adaptation to climate change.
Sustainable natural resource management interventions can provide much-needed
employment opportunities for vulnerable populations as well as maintain and enhance
productivity of households’ and communities’ agricultural, forestry, and fisheries
assets. Communities can receive income support through land rehabilitation and forest
work schemes. In addition, landscape, coastal, and fisheries programs can be scaled
up further to create jobs and support livelihoods and market access. Activities include
watershed and landscape management, weather-based index insurance, cash transfers
conditioned on the adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA), and improved climaterelated knowledge provision through extension services (World Bank 2015). See
box S3.2 for more on the role of the environment and natural resources in economic
inclusion.

Challenges in Linking to Markets
Barriers to market links need to be identified and addressed to successfully integrate
beneficiaries. Economic inclusion programs have an advantage as they already address
113

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

multiple constraints across the individual, household, community, local economy, and
institutional levels. Going further, careful analysis of the structures of informality—
access to finance, the regulatory regime, cultural context, gender dimensions, and so
forth—will be critical.
Across the individual, household, and community levels, the extreme poor face
many constraints to participating in markets. Some of these include limited capacity
and resources, small-scale production, strong risk aversion, limited mobility, informal
rules and norms, limited knowledge of markets, poor management skills, and lack
of empowerment. Extremely poor women face added constraints in interacting in
markets, including the risk of physical, sexual, and other gender-based violence;
inadequate legal protection or enforcement of existing laws; traditional gender roles
and expectations; and lack of control over resources (in particular, property) (USAID,
FHI 360, and World Vision 2017). In mitigating such constraints, in Peru, Haku Wiñay
encourages the development of inclusive business groups consisting of approximately
a dozen participants who come together for common productive activities, the
commercialization of agricultural products, or both. Groups receive special training and
support to launch their activities—usually in textiles and ceramic crafts, baking and
gastronomy, rural tourism, dairy products and byproducts, small animal rearing for
sale, fish farming, and cattle fattening.
At the local economy level, information asymmetries prevail, leading to high
transaction costs. Improving market productivity and earnings requires an in-depth
understanding of the constraints and opportunities in a market system. Market
assessments provide programs with insight on the market viability of specific
interventions as well as the competitive landscape for beneficiaries (CGAP 2012).
The Cash Transfer and Economic Inclusion Program in Egypt has launched a rapid
market assessment to identify demand- and supply-side constraints as well as available
business opportunities. With this information and previous research, the Forsa program
has begun to successfully map key sectors and economic activities, value chains,
clusters, and partners for collaboration.
The institutional and policy environment is especially important in linking
markets to the extreme poor. Multidimensional programs require careful coordination
and coherence across ministries, at different levels of government, and among
nongovernment partners. The lack of institutional clarity, roles, and responsibilities
among ministries and local authorities may challenge the provision of market services,
trading, certification, and revenue programs. Furthermore, coordination constraints
among market actors (other enterprises, buyers, intermediaries, and sellers) limit access
to high-value markets and service providers. Strong, mutually beneficial relationships
among market actors facilitate the transfer of information, skills, and services. As
an example, Haku Wiñay, either directly or in collaboration with municipalities,
encourages small-scale opportunities for trade, such as weekly fairs or festivals
targeting certain products, where participants sell their products in a less daunting
environment than traditional markets.
Furthermore, government policies and regulations play a key role in shaping the
market environment. An inappropriate policy and regulatory framework can lead to
the distortion of market efficiency, increasing costs for participants and impeding
the development of the market system. Furthermore, market systems respond to
developments in the macroeconomy and can be subject to considerable macroeconomic
volatility. Changes in exchange rates, real supply, and international monetary reserves
can have severe impacts on commodity prices. The added level of insecurity in
international and domestic markets can have severe consequences on local markets
and small producers. Macroeconomic factors, including climate factors, should be
considered for business cycle analysis and public risk management schemes for the
stabilization of markets (de Winne and Peersman 2016).

Future Directions
Although market links are well documented in the literature, this is relatively new
territory for economic inclusion programming. Economic inclusion programs provide a
comprehensive strategy to address the multiple constraints that the extreme poor face
in accessing productive markets. Linking economic inclusion programs to markets is
complex and multilayered and requires a holistic view in analysis, implementation,
and coordination efforts. Moving forward, it will be important to understand which
constraints can be addressed in the context of economic inclusion programs and which
will require greater coordination across the government policy space.

CHAPTER 5
An Assessment of Program Impacts
KEY MESSAGES
A review of evaluations of 80 programs in 37 countries shows that a broad range
of economic inclusion programs have shown promising and potentially sustained
impact on a wide range of outcomes. A bundled set of interventions shows greater
impact on income, assets, and savings relative to stand-alone interventions.
The discussion on program impact needs to be rebalanced to reflect the shifting
landscape from stand-alone nonprofit-led programs to government-led programs.
The evidence from nonprofit-led programs is indicative of persistent impact, supporting the hypothesis that economic inclusion programming can potentially launch the
extreme poor into an upward trajectory. Evidence on impact at scale is also cautiously
positive. As government-led economic inclusion programs continue to be embedded in
broader social policy, community spillover effects will become increasingly important,
and beneficiaries will likely benefit from complementary programs or refresher interventions to sustain income growth.
Although there is a strong evidence base, it does not yet go far enough in addressing several ongoing debates in economic inclusion programming. A number of critical
knowledge gaps constrain evidence-based program design and delivery.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The next wave of evaluations looks set to focus on government programs at scale
and will help isolate the mechanisms of impact of economic inclusion programming
across entry points and for different groups. This will have important operational
­implications for identifying cost-effective bundles of interventions and lessons on the
effectiveness of different delivery models.
A critical learning agenda is emerging to help address evidence gaps. These include
complementing impact evaluations with real-time operational research, program-­
monitoring assessments, and qualitative fieldwork to identify opportunities to enhance
program performance.
There is a need for a more systematic evidence base, using comparable outcomes
and indicators to conclusively establish the overall impact of the government-led
economic inclusion programs at scale. In the coming years, a meta-analysis of the
impact evidence will be an important contribution to the policy debate on the feasibility
and sustainability of scaling up economic inclusion programming.

Introduction

O

ptimism about economic inclusion programming to improve income and resilience of the extreme poor is warranted. There is a large and growing body of
research on the impact of these programs, especially those whose entry point
is based on advancing livelihoods and jobs (L&J). The initial evidence base was driven
primarily by programs led by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). In particular,
the evaluation of pilot projects modeled after BRAC’s Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP)
program, conducted by the Ford Foundation and the Consultative Group to Assist the
Poor (CGAP) in six countries, made a significant contribution to the evidence base in
diverse contexts (Banerjee et al. 2015). Subsequently, the evidence base has broadened to include a number of government-led programs, whose evidence typically had
not been considered in discussions of economic inclusion because it is often trapped in
sectoral silos. In this review, evidence is synthesized from a range of sectors, covering
evaluations of both NGO-led and government-led programs in the past decade. While
the diversity in program design and in evaluations makes comparative analysis of
impact challenging, this synthesis provides a resource on the state of knowledge on the
impact of economic inclusion programming.1
However, the evidence presented here does not go far enough in addressing several
ongoing debates in economic inclusion programming. This is an inevitable gap as the
evidence catches up with country implementation. This chapter highlights critical
gaps in understanding the mechanisms and drivers of impact, especially for large-scale
programs with social safety nets (SSNs) and financial inclusion (FI) as entry points for
different groups. The evaluations of NGO-led programs remain the first wave of knowledge, as they unpack the evidence and test alternative design and d
­ elivery modalities.
Ideally, this should lead to another wave of learning and evaluation of government-led
programs to conclusively establish whether these patterns are ­replicated at scale.
This chapter focuses on four efforts. First, it assesses the overall short-, medium-,
and long-term impacts of economic inclusion programs across a variety of income and
resilience indicators and highlights whether these impacts can be sustained at scale.
This analysis is based on a review of impact evaluations. Second, the chapter assesses
this evidence to examine two key features of economic inclusion programming: the state
of our knowledge regarding the bundling of multiple interventions relative to standalone interventions and the observed heterogeneity of impacts across population groups.
Third, the chapter draws on both impact evaluations and nonevaluative qualitative and
­operational research to identify key drivers of impact. Fourth, the chapter identifies key
directions to filling critical knowledge gaps through the pipeline of upcoming research.

Review of the Impact Literature: Method, Sample,
and Caveats
In this synthesis, we review impact evaluations of 80 economic inclusion programs in
37 countries (see figure 5.1). These programs were identified from a number of
­different sources, including the Partnership for Economic Inclusion (PEI) Landscape
Surveys of 2018 and 2020, evaluations listed in online research databases, and in
systematic reviews of economic inclusion programs (see appendix B for details). Three
programs had only a qualitative evaluation; all others had at least one quantitative evaluation, either experimental (randomized controlled trial) or quasi-experimental.
The evaluated programs in this synthesis cut across diverse institutional arrangements, contexts, and program typologies. The evidence base is largely balanced with
respect to the distribution across government-led and nongovernment-led programs, at

least with respect to overall impact on primary outcomes. The evidence is also fairly
representative of the distribution of economic inclusion programming across regions (see
chapter 3), with the majority of evaluated programs in Sub-Saharan Africa (48 percent),
followed by South Asia (25 percent) and Latin America and the Caribbean (24 percent).
However, there is a considerable gap in the scope of available evidence with respect to
evaluations of SSN-plus interventions (16 percent) relative to evaluations of L&J interventions (61 percent).2 This seems surprising given that SSNs are among the most frequently
evaluated social policy interventions in the world.3 This gap exists because this review
captures a much narrower set of evaluations of SSN-plus interventions, i.e., those featuring livelihood interventions that are bundled with regular cash transfers or public works
programs. However, the complementary programs in the review typically link SSNs with
livelihood interventions to promote economic inclusion.4
While this diversity is a valuable contribution of the report, it raises several challenges with respect to the comparability of evidence. Impact evaluations reflect the
diversity in program design and context, such that outcomes, indicators, and estimates
of impact size reported vary widely across studies (see box 5.1). As a result of this
diversity, the following allowances have been made:
• Given the limited number of evaluations of SSN-plus programs, the evidence
base and findings are presented across all three entry points (figure 5.2 and
figure 5.3), rather than disaggregating by entry point. While a total of 107 studies
for 80 programs were reviewed for the synthesis, the summary of overall impact
findings reflects 97 quantitative impact evaluations for the 71 programs for which
complete information on impact estimates from the studies could be obtained.
• There is considerable variation in the precise indicators reported, limiting the possibility of reporting precise ranges of impact sizes. There is also a strong publication
bias, with studies reporting positive results on what works, thus presenting an overly
positive picture of the evidence. In this synthesis, the focus is on summarizing the
direction of impact (when significant to at least the 10 percent level).

BOX 5.1

Gaps in the Evidence and Challenges in Making Comparative Statements

Uneven coverage of different program entry points. The single programs reviewed
are predominantly those addressing livelihoods and jobs (L&J), as evidence for social
safety net (SSN) programs and financial inclusion (FI) programs is low. The evidence
base on complementary programs is mostly available for Latin America and the
Caribbean. Although complementary programs are also more common than single
programs in East Asia and the Pacific, no evaluations are yet available.
Lack of comparability across evaluations. Studies differ widely with respect to the
outcomes and indicators examined and estimates of treatment effects (the size of the
impact). The choices are rational, based on the differing program objectives, research priorities, and data availability, but the variation limits our ability to provide an estimated range of
effect size. There are also information gaps in some evaluations. While a total of 107 studies
(including 4 qualitative evaluations) for 80 programs were reviewed for this synthesis, the
summary of findings reflects 97 quantitative impact evaluations for 71 programs for which
complete information on impact estimates from the studies could be obtained.
Positive bias. There is a strong publication bias, that is, publicly available studies tend to
emphasize results on what works, presenting an overly positive picture of the evidence.
We try to mitigate against this risk by including a large number of third-party evaluations
and experimental randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (which may be expected to be less
susceptible to positive bias relative to retrospective evaluations as the control group
is predefined). We would expect publication bias to be stronger for pilot projects and
nongovernment-led programs (where financing may depend on results), but most of these
evaluations are RCTs. A promising development is that the research pipeline is strong,
and many planned evaluations are registered, with researchers posting details of the
design, methodology, and hypothesis before starting data collection.
Limited evidence on long-term impact. Program duration varies across programs as
does the timing of impact evaluations. The overwhelming majority of programs provide
time-bound interventions (of one to three years on average). There are some exceptions:
for example, in SSN-plus programs, the SSN is typically open-ended while the “plus”
components are time bound. For comparability, we define short-term impact as measured
immediately after a program concludes, typically one to two years after program start
(i.e., when beneficiaries enroll in the program). Medium term is defined as impact
measured three to four years after program start, and long term as more than four years
after program start. Evaluations of long-term impact are limited to only three programs:
(1) Bangladesh (Targeting the Ultra Poor, different phases); (2) Uganda (Youth Opportunity
Program, YOP; Women’s Income-Generating Support, WINGS); and (3) India (Targeting the
Hard-Core Poor program, West Bengal); as well as an experiment in Ethiopia. This chapter
focuses primarily on short- and medium-term impacts, where there is more evidence, and
comments on possible directions of long-term impact for this small subset of programs.
Challenges in generalizing and unpacking evidence. Not all studies provide sufficient details on the context in which the program operates. This has implications for the
extent to which the evidence from specific (often small-scale) programs and contexts
can be generalized to other contexts, other population groups, or at scale (Pritchett and
Sandefur 2013). With a few exceptions, most evaluations are not designed to isolate
channels of impact. We speculate on the drivers of impact by drawing on nonevaluative
qualitative and operational research (see appendix B for a bibliography).

of the evaluations reported a significant negative impact for all indicators in the outcome category, although
many nonsignificant impacts were negative in sign. If an evaluation reported more than one indicator in the
broad outcome, the indicator at the highest level of aggregation was used (e.g., total asset index rather than
the number of goats or total household consumption rather than household food consumption).

Despite these caveats, the evidence base is strong for the primary outcomes of
economic inclusion programming: enhancing income and assets. Other commonly
reported outcomes relate to savings and consumption. A large number of studies also
report on employment (including on diversification of income sources) and women’s
empowerment outcomes. Only a few studies report on child outcomes (health, nutrition, or education) or on psychosocial well-being. The evidence base is smaller for
government-led programs relative to nongovernment-led programs, particularly on
psychosocial indicators of well-being, women’s empowerment, and savings.
In coming years, coordinated evaluation agendas hold the promise of establishing a more
comparable body of evidence as well a deeper understanding of the channels of impact.
This chapter draws on two such recently concluded research agendas (Banerjee et al. 2015;
Maldonado et al. 2016). In the near future, a meta-analysis would be feasible, with the inclusion of comparable evidence from multicountry evaluations by, for example, the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2018; Soares et al. 2018), Innovations for
Poverty Action and the World Bank (Bossuroy et al. 2019), and the World Food Programme
and the World Bank. In addition, over the next two years, a rich research pipeline of
program-specific evaluations, including of SSN-plus interventions, will emerge that responds
to the critical knowledge gaps identified in this chapter (see appendix B for details).5

Evidence of Overall Impact
A broad range of economic inclusion programs have shown promising—and potentially
sustained—impact on a wide range of outcomes. Figure 5.3 presents a summary of the
direction of impact across reviewed studies.6 Economic inclusion programs have helped
participants invest in productive assets and to save, earn, and consume more than they
could have without these programs. These absolute gains are typically quite small in
size but often represent large increases for the poorest, given their low baseline values.
Most programs increase household resilience to shocks by diversifying livelihoods and
sources of income, facilitating savings and access to affordable credit, and building social
networks. Many programs empower women by enhancing economic opportunities and
social status (see spotlight 1). Evidence of impact on child well-being in participating
households is more limited but suggests these programs may increase investments in
human capital.

Short-Term Impact
Enhancing incomes and assets
By enabling more effective risk management, most programs (78 percent) enable
participants to invest in productive assets. Programs with a business financial support
element (such as an asset transfer or lump-sum cash grant) mitigate against the uncertainty of asset loss, while those with an SSN element (such as a regular cash transfer or public works) provide certainty and ease liquidity constraints, allowing poor
households to maintain their investments. In programs with an asset transfer or cash
grant element, these impacts are generally larger than the value of the initial transfer,
suggesting that households have been able to increase, and often diversify, their asset
holdings, typically their livestock. This suggests this is not merely a program effect.
However, estimates of the size of increase vary widely.7
Many programs (82 percent) enable beneficiaries to save and reduce indebtedness, although this does not always translate into increased access to formal sources
of finance. Not surprisingly, this impact is more common for programs that encourage
121

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

the formation of savings groups, suggesting at least some of this may be a program
effect. For instance, Tanzania’s Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN) increased the share
of participating households that were saving by 3.9 percentage points, representing an
increase of 29 percent relative to nonparticipating households. This impact was likely
due to the formation of savings groups. However, there is some evidence from Kenya’s
Rural Entrepreneur Access Program (REAP) that shifts in saving behavior occur even
before the introduction of such groups and that impacts persist after the program ends
(Gobin, Santos, and Toth 2016). There is also the added benefit of reduced indebtedness to high-interest informal lenders. In India, community-driven livelihood
programs such as Indira Kranti Pratham and JEEViKA reduced debt-servicing costs and
increased access to low-cost credit (Prennushi and Gupta 2014; Deininger and Liu 2013;
Hoffmann et al. 2017). In a similar program, India’s National Rural Livelihood Mission
(NRLM), an additional 2.5 years of membership in self-help groups increased total
household savings by 28 percent and reduced the share of informal loans in total debt
by 20 percent over baseline values (Kochar et al. 2020).
Economic inclusion programs broaden opportunities for poor households, enabling
them to diversify incomes as household members shift from casual wage employment
to farm and nonfarm self-employment. Among the programs reporting on employment
outcomes, 67 percent reported a significant impact on the time participants spent working or a shift from wage to self-employment. Because most poor people are typically
employed as casual wage workers in precarious, seasonal, and sometimes hazardous
work, economic inclusion programs provide an opportunity to shift to more productive
self-employment in farm or nonfarm activities. For women, this is often a significant
occupational transformation.8 For labor-unconstrained households, this also offers an
opportunity to diversify household income, with some members continuing as wage
workers while others start subsistence businesses, typically in livestock rearing, fisheries, and petty trade. While SSN programs tend to emphasize income diversification for
resilience, L&J programs tend to do so for sustained income growth.
In most cases, the increased investment in productive assets and the shift in
employment patterns translates into higher income. Most programs (75 percent of those
reporting on this outcome) increased overall household or per capita incomes.9 The
four SSN programs reporting an impact on income found a significant positive impact.
For most L&J programs, this increased income effect persisted for one or two years after
participants exited the program. In almost all cases, these improvements were driven
by increased income from livestock or nonfarm petty trade that persisted for one or two
years after program exit. In addition, programs often encourage adoption of good business practices, with these translating into income growth in some cases (such as youth
in Uganda and Ethiopia and men in Sri Lanka) but not in others (such as women in Sri
Lanka) (Blattman, Dercon, and Franklin 2019; Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2014; de
Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2012).
Although absolute gains tend to be small, even small increases can be meaningful, given low baseline values. Estimates of effect sizes vary considerably, but most
participants in economic inclusion programs tend to experience small absolute gains.
In Bangladesh, participants (all women) in phase 1 of TUP increased their total annual
earnings by only $23 two years after program completion (and $26 four years after
program completion), but this small amount represented a 34 percent increase two
years after program completion (and 38 percent four years after) over their preprogram earnings (Bandiera et al. 2013). There are, however, some programs that have
had larger impacts. In Afghanistan, participants in the TUP program increased their
total monthly household income and revenues from productive activities by approximately $19 relative to nonparticipants (a 23 percent increase) (Bedoya et al. 2019). In
Uganda, participants in the Youth Opportunity Program (YOP) increased their monthly

122

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

cash earnings by approximately $8.50 (41 percent) relative to nonparticipants, while
participants in the Women’s Income-Generating Support (WINGS) program experienced
an increase of approximately $5.19 (66 percent) relative to nonparticipants (Blattman,
Fiala, and Martinez 2014; Blattman et al. 2016).

Improving household welfare and building resilience
Economic inclusion programs increase overall welfare in both monetary and nonmonetary dimensions. Many economic inclusion programs (71 percent of those reporting on
consumption outcomes) protect poor households against destitution, enabling them to
cover their basic needs, maintain consumption levels, and enhance food security. The
limited evidence on child outcomes finds largely positive impacts, suggesting that these
programs may increase investments in human capital and belying the concern that the
income-generating activities promoted by these programs crowd out investments in
human capital.10
By increasing economic opportunities and asset ownership for women participants, several programs also served to empower women. The quantitative evidence on
women’s empowerment suggests only marginally positive impacts (with 57 percent of
the 28 studies reporting on this outcome finding a positive impact). However, qualitative assessments are overwhelmingly positive, pointing to improvements in mobility, social status, household decision-making, and psychological well-being as critical
outcomes for all participants but especially for women. See, for example, MorenoSánchez et al. (2018) and Moreno-Sánchez, Martínez, et al. (2018) for Colombia’s
Produciendo Por Mi Futuro (PxMF).
Most programs make households more resilient to shocks and stresses. They
accomplish this by providing regular, predictable transfers, by facilitating asset
­accumulation, income diversification, access to low-cost credit, and social networks
(all of which provide some protection against risk and help households adopt nonerosive coping strategies) or both. A handful of SSN programs also report increased use
of insurance products, reducing vulnerability to health shocks.11 These features help
participants prepare, cope with, and recover from shocks.
In particularly shock-prone areas, programs strengthened household resilience ex ante. In Ethiopia, the Pastoralist Areas Resilience Improvement and
Market Expansion (PRIME) project supported pastoralist households in coping
with drought-induced animal mortality. During a period of multiple droughts,
participants experienced a 40 percent lower decline in food security relative to
nonparticipants (Smith et al. 2019). In the Sahel, SSN programs helped households cope with the multiple and recurrent shocks (including drought, desertification, floods, conflict, and economic and health shocks) prevalent in the region. In
Burkina Faso, for example, in addition to experiencing improvements in well-­being,
income, assets, and savings, participants in a cash-plus program also reduced their
use of negative coping strategies in the first year of the program (FAO 2016). In
Bangladesh, two economic inclusion programs increased awareness about disaster preparedness while also helping households cope with seasonal food insecurity
during droughts or floods (Siddiki et al. 2014; Hernandez et al. 2016; HTSPE 2011).
Particularly relevant as the world grapples with the COVID-19 crisis, some
programs explicitly support livelihood recovery after shocks. In Madagascar, the
Fiavota program helped households revive their income-generating activities in
severely drought-affected areas, with participants earning approximately $7 more
per month compared to nonparticipants (Rakotomanana, Randrianatoandro, and
Ravelosoa 2018).

Impact over the Medium and Long Terms
Many of these impacts are sustained in the medium term. We define medium-term
impact as measured three to four years after enrollment in the program; for one-off
or time-bound programs, this is typically one or two years after beneficiaries exit the
program. The following are examples:
• Programs offering time-bound interventions in Bangladesh (TUP), six CGAP–Ford
Foundation pilot sites (in India–West Bengal, Ghana, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Peru, and
Yemen), and Rwanda (Concern Worldwide Rwanda’s Graduation Program). Shortterm gains in asset ownership, income, employment, and well-being remained
positive and significant in the medium term. However, effect sizes were generally smaller in magnitude, and the trajectories varied across countries, with gains
continuing to increase on some dimensions in some countries and starting to decline
in others. See figure 5.10 for effect sizes over time and across countries (Bandiera et
al. 2017; Banerjee et al. 2015; Misha et al. 2019; Ahmed et al. 2009; Devereux and
Sabates 2016; Emran, Robano, and Smith 2009). In two CGAP–Ford Foundation pilot
sites (India–Andhra Pradesh and Honduras), participants experienced no significant gains (or decline) in assets, incomes, or consumption over time (Banerjee et al.
2015; Bauchet, Morduch, and Ravi 2015).
• Programs offering one-off capital grants and short-duration training (five days) to
youth in Uganda and Ethiopia. Short-term increases in occupation, hours of work,
and earnings were sustained in the medium term. Capital stocks, however, started
to converge between participants and nonparticipants toward the end of four years
(Blattman, Dercon, and Franklin 2019; Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2018).
• Programs providing an open-ended component (typically a cash transfer) in
addition to time-bound interventions. In Ethiopia, among households receiving the Household Asset-Based Program, those receiving a longer duration of the
Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) (five years as opposed to just one year)
were able to significantly increase their crop yields and boost their agricultural
productivity (Hoddinott et al. 2012).
Over the longer term—for up to seven years—some of these impacts continued to
be sustained for the two programs for which this evidence is available.12 The Targeting
the Hard-Core Poor (THCP) program in West Bengal had positive and accelerating longterm impact with respect to economic opportunities and material well-being of beneficiaries even seven years after being enrolled in the program (nearly six years after program
completion). For instance, the asset index (including production and household assets)
was 0.89 standard deviations larger in the short term, 1.00 standard deviation larger in the
medium term, and 0.99 standard deviations larger in the long term, relative to the b
­ aseline.
Sustained improvements are also evident for total household income and consumption,
while psychosocial impacts that had dissipated in the medium term improved in the long
term (Banerjee et al. 2016). In Bangladesh, TUP also had sustained positive impact on
income, savings, and food security for up to seven years. Long-term impact on asset ownership, however, was mixed: some studies found a sustained and even accelerating increase
in productive assets (including land holdings) (Bandiera et al. 2017; Raza, Das, and Misha
2012; Asadullah and Ara 2016), but others found that vulnerability to shocks had resulted
in asset losses for some households (Krishna, Poghosyan, and Das 2012).
However, longer-term impacts start to dissipate or reduce in size nine to ten years
after program enrollment. In Bangladesh, some long-term impacts on assets, savings,
employment, and food ­security persist even nine years after program enrollment, but
effect sizes are very small (Asadullah and Ara 2016) or persisted only for existing
124

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

entrepreneurs but not for others (Misha et al. 2019).13 A recent 10-year evaluation of
the THCP program in West Bengal shows positive impacts on assets, income, consumption, and health persist even ten years later. For instance, beneficiaries still had higher
asset ownership compared to nonbeneficiaries but the size was smaller after ten years
relative to after seven years (0.35 standard deviations higher relative to 0.8 standard
deviations). The impact on income and revenues, on the other hand, persisted at the
same level (0.3 standard deviations higher than nonparticipants) even after ten years
(Banerjee et al. 2020). In Ethiopia and Uganda, only some changes persisted, as most
long-term impacts of L&J programs dissipated (Blattman, Dercon, and Franklin 2019;
Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez 2018). For instance, nine years later, YOP participants
in Uganda remained slightly more likely than nonparticipants to be in skilled trades,
rather than in petty business, and to have household assets and livestock (Blattman,
Fiala, and Martinez 2018). This declining long-term impact was partly due to catch-up
by the nonparticipants, whose incomes, earnings, and consumption grew slightly faster
than those of participants (in Bangladesh and Uganda), and partly due to coverage
expansion of SSNs (in Bangladesh).
These findings are indicative of persistent impact on a range of outcomes,
­suggesting that these are not just short-term program effects of time-bound asset transfers, cash grants, or savings group mobilization. The fact that impacts persist at least
in the medium term suggests that economic inclusion programming can, at minimum,
launch the extreme poor into an upward trajectory. In addition, a handful of program
evaluations find accelerating long-term impact of up to seven years and persisting for
up to ten years. These findings are indicative of the potential of these programs to
unlock poverty traps. Further research is warranted on a broader set of programs to
conclusively establish whether this is the case.14
In the meantime, expectations need to be appropriately calibrated: impact of a
one-off or time-bound intervention will be more likely to persist in the long term if the
original participants have the option of receiving discrete “refresher” interventions over
time, such as training and coaching to grow enterprises, labor market intermediation,
support for market links, and so forth. Alternatively, the duration of support may need
to be extended, especially in harsh ecosystems and settings of fragility, conflict, and
violence (FCV). In other words, economic inclusion programming is far more likely to
lead to transformative solutions to poverty and to sustained long-term income growth
for the poorest if embedded in a continuum of support, at the micro and meso levels.

Impact at Scale
While a number of government-led programs have shown positive impact on
incomes, assets, savings, and consumption, the effects are heterogeneous.15 The
breadth and depth of the evidence base on government-led programs is more limited
relative to that of nongovernment-led programs (see figure 5.2). The majority report
positive impacts on assets (67 percent of programs reporting on this outcome),
savings (100 percent), and employment outcomes (including diversification)
(75 percent). More than half the studies of government-led programs also find positive impact on income and consumption. We review these examples to highlight three
main concerns in scaling up programs:
1. Sustaining impact as a program scales up coverage (and scope)
2. Achieving impact when economic inclusion programming scales up through complementary programs that link to existing SSNs and L&J
3. Realizing indirect spillover effects on the wider local economy
125

Some government-led programs have managed to sustain positive impact even
as they expand functional scope and coverage to a large number of beneficiaries. In
India, the NRLM (and its state-level precursors)16 built grassroots platforms of women’s
self-help groups linking women to finance, livelihood opportunities, and other social
programs. The state-level program in Andhra Pradesh increased access to finance, asset
holdings, social networks, and well-being in the short and medium terms (Prennushi
and Gupta 2014; Deininger and Liu 2009, 2013). In Bihar, poor households benefited
from access to lower-cost credit and increased their ownership of assets over two years
(Hoffmann et al. 2017). Several of these impacts were sustained in seven additional
states under NRLM, with an increase in household income (a 19 percent increase over
preprogram income), number of income sources, savings, and links to government
programs. However, impact on assets, overall consumption, or women’s empowerment
were more limited or not yet apparent in these states. For instance, although intrahousehold decision-making was not affected, the program helped women, especially
those with some education, gain greater confidence in engaging with the community
(Kochar et al. 2020).
Some complementary SSN and L&J programs have helped households increase
household productivity and income, diversify income, and accumulate assets,
including:
• Large-scale livelihood programs in Peru (Haku Wiñay) and Colombia (PxMF) that
link with their countries’ conditional cash transfer programs (Juntos and Más
Familias en Acción, respectively)17 offer a comprehensive bundle of interventions.
These have helped participants increase their asset holdings, improve productivity,
and shift from agricultural wage employment to self-employment, thereby raising
income, consumption, and personal well-being (Escobal and Ponce 2016, MorenoSánchez, Maldonado, et al. 2018).
• Large-scale SSN programs that link their beneficiaries with existing livelihood
programs have also experienced similarly positive results for some outcomes.
In Ethiopia, households benefiting from PSNP and the Household Asset Building
Program increased assets (livestock holdings and farm equipment), productivity,
and food security (Berhane et al. 2014; Hoddinott et al. 2012; Sabates-Wheeler and
Devereux 2012). Other complementary unconditional cash transfer and livelihood
programs also increased asset accumulation and well-being in Lesotho and Malawi
(FAO and UNICEF 2018; Pace et al. 2017).
• Some overlapping SSN and agriculture development programs have also increased
productivity, income diversification, and financial inclusion in Brazil, El Salvador,
and Peru.18 In El Salvador, the complementarity of a conditional cash transfer and
agricultural development program increased income diversification for small- and
medium-scale farmers and access to credit for subsistence farmers (de Sanfeliú,
Ángel, and Shi 2016).
However, many such complementary programs fall short of their potential to
achieve positive synergies. For some overlapping and complementary programs in
Brazil, Colombia, Kenya, Mexico, and Peru, despite the positive impact of the individual programs, there was no additive or multiplicative impact of the combination (Costa,
Helfand, and Souza 2018; Yúnez-Naude et al. 2016; Moya 2016; Jensen, Barrett, and
Mude 2017; Aldana, Vásquez, and Yancari 2016).19 This may be because the complementary programs are not particularly well designed or effectively coordinated to
provide a bundled set of interventions or because the bundle does not collectively
address the multiple constraints faced by participants.

Finally, we do not know enough about the indirect impact that large-scale
economic inclusion programs might have on the broader local economy. Scaled-up
programs may generate spillover effects in two ways: through network effects, such as
demonstration effects or the sharing of information with nonparticipants, or through
general equilibrium effects (economic multipliers). The handful of studies that report
spillover effects on nonparticipants in a community find evidence of b
­ ehavioral
change and increased personal and social empowerment (Raza, Van de Poel, and
van Ourti 2018; Misha et al. 2019; Deininger and Liu 2009). However, there remain
concerns about sustaining implementation quality and hence impact on these outcomes
(Hoffmann et al. 2018). Less is known about economic multipliers that may influence
local economywide impact on material outcomes at scale. Program design and contextual factors matter: we would expect greater price effects for programs with high transfers, with large numbers of participants per locality, and in isolated communities with
reliance on local rather than regional or national markets (see box 5.2).

BOX 5.2

Achieving Economic Inclusion in FCV Settings

Several economic inclusion programs operating in fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV)
settings have had positive impacts on the income and resilience of the extreme poor. For
instance, Afghanistan’s Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP) program had a greater impact relative
to similar programs in stable contexts (Bedoya et al. 2019). Similarly, Concern Worldwide
Burundi’s Terintambwe, the Trickle Up graduation program in Burkina Faso, and Fonkoze’s
Chemen Lavi Miyò (CLM) in Haiti had positive impacts on incomes, assets, savings, and child
outcomes (Devereux et al. 2015; Karimli, Bose, and Kagotho 2019; Roelen and Saha 2019).
In Côte d’Ivoire, a microenterprise program Projet d’Insertion Socio-Economique (PRISE),
increased the likelihood of entry into self-employment as well as savings and investments,
although it had no impact on earnings (Premand and Marguerie 2020). In contrast, a public
works program (Projet d’Urgence de Création d’Emploi Jeunes et de Développement des
Compétences, PEJEDEC) increased earnings from self-employment by approximately $12
(a 32 percent increase compared to nonparticipants) but had no impact on participation in
wage- or self-employment (Bertrand et al. 2017). Another public works–plus program (Urban
Youth Employment Program, UYEP) in Papua New Guinea was able to translate temporary
wage employment into formal sector employment by directly influencing employer preferences (Hoy and Naidoo 2019).
However, program disruption due to conflict can undermine impact. In South Sudan’s
Youth Business Start-Up Grant Program, youths who received training and a cash grant
substantially increased savings and consumption by about a 1.0 standard deviation and
in psychological well-being by 0.8 standard deviations. Impacts were similar for men
and women. Those who expected to receive the combination but received only training,
due to program disruption following the outbreak of conflict, experienced no impact on
savings and a small decline in consumption. For women, program disruption also led to
a severe reduction in trust by 0.9 standard deviations (Müller, Pape, and Ralston 2019).
In many cases, provision of economic opportunities is a means to improve social cohesion, especially for at-risk youth in FCV settings. Impact has been mixed on this front.

Achieving Economic Inclusion in FCV Settings (continued)

In Côte d’Ivoire, the PRISE program was able to increase group participation and solidarity in the locality, even though there was little impact on broader indicators of social
cohesion such as exposure to violence (Premand and Marguerie 2020). Similarly, the
UYEP program in Papua New Guinea had a substantial positive impact on participants’
interactions with their peer group and social behavior, but more limited effects on the
socioeconomic causes of crime (Ivaschenko et al. 2016).

Factors That Mediate Impact
With a few exceptions, most evaluations are not designed to isolate mechanisms of
impact. This is a critical knowledge gap with respect to two core elements of economic
inclusion programming:
• Bundling of interventions
• Focusing on the extreme poor and vulnerable
The emerging evidence reveals the importance of coordinating multiple interventions vis-à-vis stand-alone interventions. However, most programs have heterogeneous impacts, with the poorest and most vulnerable experiencing the fewest gains.
For programs that target both men and women, there is some evidence of d
­ ifferential
impacts. Much of this evidence comes from NGO-led programs and from experimental studies (some of which build on government programs). More recently, there have
been some evaluations of government-led programs that explore these questions,
and a ­pipeline of forthcoming research is anticipated that could start to answer these
­questions more definitively, including for government-led programs.

Bundled Interventions Have a Larger Impact Than Stand-Alone
Interventions
A core feature of economic inclusion programming is combining different interventions
to address multiple constraints; such interactions are likely to drive overall program
impact. While stand-alone interventions can also impact incomes, assets, and resilience,
a single intervention—a regular cash transfer, an asset transfer or a cash grant, business
training, agricultural extension services, or access to finance—would not necessarily
help those facing multiple constraints, or would do so to a lesser extent.20
A comprehensive suite of interventions has larger and more sustained impact on
income, assets, and savings relative to stand-alone interventions. In pilot programs in
Ghana (Graduating the Ultra Poor, GUP), South Sudan (TUP), and Uganda (Village
Enterprise microenterprise program), the classic graduation package had ­significant
­positive impact on income, assets, consumption and food security, and women’s
­empowerment. In all three countries, stand-alone interventions had much more
limited impact.
• In Ghana’s GUP, a stand-alone savings intervention had a short-term impact on
assets, income, consumption, and savings. However, only the recipients of the
128

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

full set of i­nterventions (with or without a savings component) were able to grow
­businesses, invest in assets and savings, and sustain income gains in the medium term
(figure 5.4). Similar findings emerged for a stand-alone asset transfer relative to the
classic graduation bundle (even without a savings component) (Banerjee et al. 2018).
• In South Sudan’s TUP, a stand-alone cash grant increased consumption levels but
had no impact on asset wealth relative to the comprehensive program (Chowdhury
et al. 2017).
• In Uganda’s Village Enterprise program, a stand-alone cash grant improved asset
ownership but had no other impact, although a combination of the grant with
light-touch behavioral interventions possibly facilitated a shift from wage to self-­
employment and reduced child labor (Sedlmayr, Shah, and Sulaiman 2019).
These findings suggest that the poorest population groups derive higher economic
value from a lump-sum cash grant or an asset transfer when also provided with
complementary training, coaching, and regular transfers.21 In Peru, there was considerable heterogeneity in the bundle of interventions accessed by different households
under Haku Wiñay; this had implications for the magnitude of impact.22 Grouping
households into terciles based on the intensity of interventions, the tercile that received
the lowest-intensity bundle increased income by 35 percent, as compared with a
51 percent increase for the tercile that received the highest-intensity bundle. Impact on
resilience to shocks (and on empowerment) was significant only for the tercile receiving the highest program intensity (Escobal and Ponce 2016).
In livelihood programs, bundling lump-sum cash grants with training and group
formation can increase household incomes and welfare relative to either intervention in isolation. The cash grant eases capital constraints, training addresses human

capital constraints, and group formation helps the poorest households form social
networks. In Uganda’s WINGS, youths who were provided with a cash grant of $150,
basic training and were mobilized into savings groups increased their incomes by
a 0.15 standard deviation (significant at 10 percent) relative to those who received
only the grant and basic training (figure 5.5). In addition, supervision increased their
chances of business survival (Blattman et al. 2016). Similarly, in Sri Lanka, an experimental study found that a combination of cash grant and training was successful in
getting women to start a subsistence business. Business training alone also increased
business ownership but to a lesser extent, and the combination was needed to boost
profits and capital stock (de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff 2014).
A combination of asset transfers and training has a similarly larger positive
impact on household income and consumption relative to stand-alone interventions.
In Rwanda’s Girinka (“one cow per poor family”) program, this effect persisted: households that received both the livestock asset transfer and training had higher milk
production, livestock productivity, earnings, and asset accumulation in the long term.23
In particular, complementary training provided at the same time as the asset transfer
led to self-perpetuating gains over time; subsequent training, possibly of lower ­quality,
did not have the same impact (Argent, Augsburg, and Rasul 2014). These ­findings
are striking in contexts where households have weak links to markets and might
be expected to have lower returns to such investments. In Burundi’s Terintambwe
program, beneficiaries highlighted the importance of training and coaching that
provided them the knowledge and confidence required to maximize their returns from
the asset transfer and income support (Roelen and Devereux 2019).
Similarly, while cash transfers ease consumption constraints and enable risk
taking, bundling livelihood interventions can amplify impact by further easing production constraints. These effects seem to vary depending on the nature of the additional
intervention. In drought-affected areas, the government of Nicaragua added layers to
a conditional cash transfer (Atención a Crisis) in the form of either a lump-sum cash
grant (with some coaching) or vocational training. The combination of the cash grant
with the regular transfer increased average income and consumption and increased
household resilience to the negative impact of droughts, partly due to their role in

facilitating income diversification.24 Households eligible to receive the cash grant were
13 percentage points more likely to be self-employed in nonagricultural activities, relative to just 4 percent of those receiving either the cash transfer alone or the cash transfer combined with training (figure 5.6). Those eligible to receive the cash grant also
had substantially higher profits from nonagricultural self-employment, approximately
a 15 to 20 percent annual return on the initial cash grant ($200) even two years after
the program ended (Macours, Premand, and Vakis 2012). Similarly, in Burkina Faso and
Niger, a cash-plus program had greater positive impact on income, asset accumulation,
and food security than a stand-alone asset transfer (FAO 2016).
In public works programs, the impact of bundling livelihood interventions appears
to be more muted and context specific. In Côte d’Ivoire’s Projet d’Urgence de Création
d’Emploi Jeunes et de Développement des Compétences (PEJEDEC), a public works–plus
program, participation in public works alone had a significant positive impact on savings
and on well-being, but all program variants had similarly insignificant impacts on income
and assets (figure 5.7). However, self-employment earnings of youths who received the
basic entrepreneurship training in addition to participating in the public works program
were higher than those engaged only in the public works (Bertrand et al. 2017). In Papua
New Guinea, youth who participated in the public works–plus variant of the Urban Youth
Employment Program (UYEP) were substantially more likely to be in formal employment
in the short term, relative to those who participated only in the public works variant. The
positive employment impact of the public works–plus was achieved through screening
candidates on ability and by combining job-matching assistance and on-the-job training
with wage subsidies to employers. Fewer than 15 percent of employers reported willingness to keep the same number of placements without a subsidy (Hoy and Naidoo 2019).

Some complementary programs also display these positive synergies, with the
cumulative impact greater than that of the individual programs. For instance, in Brazil
the overlapping implementation of Bolsa Família (a conditional cash transfer) and
Pronaf (a subsidized agricultural credit) had a greater aggregate impact on land productivity and income than the individual programs (Garcia, Helfand, and Souza 2016). In
Malawi, the joint impact of an unconditional cash transfer and farm input subsidy was
about 22 percent larger than that of the sum of the impacts of the stand-alone programs
on the value of production (Daidone et al. 2017). As previously noted, however, many
complementary programs do not have any additive or multiplicative impact of the
combined programs.
It is possible that in some contexts further bundling may be necessary
to address the multiple constraints faced by the target populations. In Peru
(prior to Haku Wiñay), complementary programs—a conditional cash transfer (Juntos) and technical training (Sierra Sur)—influenced the adoption of new
­technologies and increased assets. However, these changes did not translate into
higher income in the absence of financial or other support (Aldana, Vásquez,
and Yancari 2016). Similarly, in Côte d’Ivoire, the Projet d’Insertion SocioEconomique program (PRISE) found very little difference across different variants (combining training with semicredit, cash grant, or establishment of village
savings and credit association). Possibly, additional interventions, such as a regular cash transfer, may have been necessary in the fragile, postconflict setting
(Premand and Marguerie 2020).
In summary, the emerging evidence suggests that a bundled set of interventions
has greater impact than its constituent stand-alone interventions. However, knowledge
of this key aspect of economic inclusion programming is still limited. Further research
is needed to conclusively establish this finding, particularly if this holds at scale, for
different population groups, and across a range of contexts. It is also important to better
understand the marginal impact (and costs, see chapter 6) of each intervention, relative to the overall impact of the program, in order to identify cost-effective bundles for
different population groups and contexts.25

Heterogeneity of Impact: Not Everyone Benefits to the Same Extent
Program impact often varies across participants, with greater impact on incomes
and assets for the least poor among the target population. For instance, in the
medium term, the impact of the classic graduation pilots on the asset index among
people at the 90th percentile was more than 14 times greater than among those at
the 10th percentile (Banerjee et al. 2015). In Afghanistan, a similar program (TUP)
also found significantly higher impact on livestock holdings for the top relative to
the bottom quintile (Bedoya et al. 2019). In Bangladesh’s TUP, these differences
persist over time, with medium-term effects on savings and assets being greater at
the 95th relative to the 5th percentile (Bandiera et al. 2017). This seems to hold in
SSN-plus programs too. In Côte d’Ivoire, the PEJEDEC program also had substantially higher impact on income and savings for youths at the top end of the distribution relative to those at the bottom, although these differences were muted after the
program closed (Bertrand et al. 2017).
With respect to other dimensions of social exclusion, the picture may be more
nuanced, especially in community-based programs. In Andhra Pradesh, Scheduled
Tribes experienced greater increases in savings, livestock assets, consumption, and
education outcomes compared to other participants in the state-level (pre-NRLM)
program (Prennushi and Gupta 2014). Similarly, in Bihar’s JEEViKA, landless households (predominantly Scheduled Caste) benefited more than landowning households
with respect to reductions in cost of credit (Hoffmann et al. 2017). These patterns
held in seven other states under NRLM, with greater gains to Scheduled Caste and
Tribe households (Kochar et al. 2020). (For more on Scheduled Casts and Tribes, see
case study 2.)
However, absolute gains are largely positive across the distribution. In some
programs, the poor experienced larger impacts on food security, psychological well-­
being, and human capital investments. The classic graduation pilots, for example,
increased food security only toward the lower end of the distribution, at the 25th
percentile (Banerjee et al. 2015). Similar programs in Afghanistan (TUP) and Colombia
(PxMF) yielded greater and more sustained improvements in subjective well-being
and aspirations for the poorest and for those who started the program with lower life
satisfaction compared to other participants (Moreno-Sánchez, Maldonado, et al. 2018;
Bedoya et al. 2019).
Participants also differ with respect to their trajectories during the program
and after program exit (in the case of time-bound programs). Many participants—
referred to as “improvers” or “fast climbers”—experience positive changes during the
program and manage to sustain these changes afterward. These sustained changes
include increasing income; diversifying income; increasing resilience to shocks;
investing in their children’s health, nutrition, and education; and planning for the
future with some degree of confidence. Another group of participants—referred to as
“late improvers” or “slow climbers”—might only gradually start to show improvements. Yet others—referred to as “decliners”—who may or may not have experienced positive changes during the program are unable to sustain whatever changes
they experienced and end up on a downward trajectory. Among this latter group,
some (“crash outs”) may even fall back to preprogram levels (see figure 5.8). See
Sabates-Wheeler, Sabates, and Devereux (2018) for trajectories of Concern Worldwide
Rwanda participants, Shoaf and Simanowitz (2019) for Chemen Lavi Miyò in Haiti,
and Sengupta (2012) for the classic graduation pilot in Ethiopia. These trajectories
can vary across participants, depending on a number of factors mediating impact, as
examined in the following material.

A number of factors enable—or constrain—economic inclusion in different contexts
and for different population groups. Getting the design right is important for all
social policy, but it is critically so for economic inclusion programming that seeks to
address multiple constraints for the poor. Program design features vary enormously,
with respect to the bundling and sequencing of different interventions, as well as the
adequacy, intensity, and duration of support.26 This can drive both the size and the
heterogeneity of impact. On the one hand, if a poverty trap exists, impact will vary
depending on the distance of participants from the threshold and whether the program
is designed to provide just the right amount of support. On the other hand, variations
in participant characteristics can also affect participants’ choices (such as between
short-term consumption and long-term investments), their returns from livelihoods, and
thus their trajectories after exposure to the program.
Thus, impacts vary across different types of programs, for similar programs in
different contexts, and for the same program with different population groups. The
main factors that drive impact include the ecosystem in which program participants
operate—that is, institutional factors that determine program design and delivery as
well as markets and community-level factors—and the characteristics of participating
households and individuals (figure 5.9).

Context: Institutions
Institutional capacity, of both local administrative structures and the reach of private
sector and nongovernment partners, can influence impact. Staff capacity is critical in
economic inclusion programs, with a mix of technical, managerial, communication,
and interpersonal skills required. The bundling of interventions and use of digital solutions require partnerships between the government and the private sector, NGOs, and

civil society. Uneven implementation across geographic locations can lead to variable
impact across groups (Berhane et al. 2014), or can dilute impact, especially as programs
scale up (Hoffmann et al. 2018).27
In particular, as reviewed in chapter 2, complementary programs require policy
coherence and effective interagency coordination to unlock positive synergies across
constituent programs. In most contexts, positive synergies from coordinated interventions
are more likely to emerge where there are significant market failures, such as those faced
by small farmers and rural microentrepreneurs. In these cases, cash transfers provide
liquidity and certainty, while the complementary livelihood interventions and financial services address production constraints, including technical knowledge and access
to inputs, credit, and markets (Tirivayi, Knowles, and Davis 2013; Soares et al. 2017).
However, these synergies will not necessarily materialize when programs are merely
overlapping in geographic coverage, without any attempt at joint policy articulation or
operational coordination (Slater et al. 2016). Programs designed for different target groups
(in terms of poverty status, land or asset ownership, education, and ability, for example)
would not achieve much complementarity in coverage or have much aggregate impact on
economic inclusion.28

Context: Markets and communities
The broader ecosystem in which program participants operate shapes local livelihoods and mediates impact from economic inclusion programs that seek to
influence these livelihoods. These contextual factors include communitywide
­characteristics, such as location (for example, concerning remoteness and connectivity), level of development (such as availability and quality of infrastructure and
services), local economy (including economic growth, agroclimatic ­conditions, labor
demand, and purchasing power), access to input and output markets (­including
integration of local markets with regional or national markets), and exposure to
shocks (especially climate, conflict, and disease).
As a result, similar programs can yield very different outcomes in different locations.
The evaluation of the CGAP–Ford classic graduation pilot projects implemented in a very
wide range of contexts revealed significant impacts in all but one case, but the size varied
across the pilots (see figure 5.10) (Banerjee et al. 2015; J-PAL and IPA Policy Bulletin 2015).

Similarly, in India, the same model had significant impact on incomes and assets in one
India state but not in another, largely due to differences in the local economy (Bauchet,
Morduch, and Ravi 2015). In Peru’s Haku Wiñay, for example, heterogeneity of outcomes
is associated with the level of economic dynamism of the local area (Asensio, Fernández,
and Burneo 2016).29 In harsh ecosystems and FCV contexts, achieving impact is feasible
but can be particularly challenging (box 5.2). In particular, shocks can disrupt program
delivery such that households receiving partial inputs or inputs of a poorer quality than
planned tend to fare poorly, in both material and psychosocial terms (Müller, Pape, and
Ralston 2019).
Economic inclusion programming at scale needs to address these covariate
constraints, particularly with respect to facilitating market access (see spotlight 3).
Large-scale programs can generate spillover effects—positive and negative—especially
in contexts where there are significant market failures (see box 5.3). For instance,
programs promoting self-employment may lead to constrained market supply or market
saturation if local input or output markets are weakly integrated with regional or
national markets. Program participants in Paraguay and Colombia experienced market
saturation in poorly integrated local markets (CADEP 2017; Sheldon 2016). However,
this was not the case for program participants in Bangladesh, which had better regional
market integration (Banerjee et al. 2015; Bandiera et al. 2017).
In addition, community norms can promote or restrict the extent to which p
­ articipants
benefit from the opportunities offered by economic inclusion programs. For instance, some
communities have a strong practice of sharing in mutual support networks. While this
is an important informal SSN, such sharing of in-kind and cash transfers from economic
inclusion programs can dilute the expected impact (­Sabates-Wheeler, Lind, and Hoddinott
2013). In the Sahel, successful people face community pressure toward generosity to show
solidarity with other community members (Bossuroy, Koussoubé, and Premand 2019).
Many programs involve ­communities heavily in the selection of beneficiaries; while this is
136

BOX 5.3

Spillover Impact on Communities and the Local Economy

Livelihood programs that promote self-employment and microenterprises can potentially generate positive or negative spillover effects. In particular, integration with
regional markets is important, as there are limits to how many similar enterprises a
single community can support. In Paraguay’s Sembrando Oportunidades Familia por
Familia and Colombia’s PxMF, participants reported low profitability due to lower than
anticipated sales at low prices, as the small local market was flooded and resources
were limited in the community. These low profit margins were reinforced by poor
connectivity with markets for remote communities and weak input markets, which led
to reliance on a few vendors providing poor-quality chickens and feed in some areas
(CADEP 2017; Sheldon 2016). However, this may not be the case for all programs and
in all contexts. In Bangladesh’s Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP) program, the program-induced shift from casual wage employment to self-employment for participants
increased local casual wages but did not have negative spillover effects on village livestock prices. This was possibly because there were dynamic regional livestock markets
in the program areas. Also, general equilibrium effects may be small if scale-up takes
the form of geographic expansion of a narrowly targeted program. Although the poor
benefit, there might only be a modest impact on the village economy’s overall asset
stock, output markets, and labor markets (Banerjee et al. 2015; Bandiera et al. 2017).
For stand-alone social safety net (SSN) programs, there is considerable evidence
of positive local economy impacts. In seven Sub-Saharan countries, a public works
program and cash transfers generated substantial income multipliers (Taylor, Thome,
and Filipski 2016; Filipski et al. 2017). In Ethiopia, for example, the PSNP had substantial
impact on supply, demand, wages, and prices in both PSNP and non-PSNP areas. There
was considerable variation across regions, depending on program design as well as
contextual factors, such as the structure of the local economy, types of household activities, and degree of integration with outside markets.
Complementing SSNs with livelihood interventions can also have substantial spillover
effects on the local economy, especially when each mitigates possible negative impacts
of a stand-alone intervention. For example, much of the rationale for the expansion of
cash and livelihood interventions in Malawi has been to compensate for the removal of
ineffective and expensive farm input subsidies (Kagin et al. 2019; Filipski et al. 2017).

critical in building support and utilizing local knowledge, it can also result in the crowding out of other support, especially when programs are rationed. For instance, in Rwanda,
participants in the Concern Worldwide graduation program were removed from the beneficiary lists of the government program, Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme, to make room
for others not receiving any support (Devereux and Sabates 2016). These local norms are
harder to shift through program design.

Context: Households and individuals
At the household level, initial endowments determine the magnitude of an impact.
Most of the programs reviewed here found that households with prior asset ownership,
137

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

more labor availability in the household or extended family, and better social relations were in a better position to take advantage of the opportunities offered by
economic inclusion programs. The effect of prior asset ownership is particularly important if there are complementarities between asset types, such as land and livestock
(Sabates-Wheeler, Sabates, and Devereux 2018). The age, sex, and skills of the labor
pool available to households is important in defining its trajectory. Across the board,
labor-constrained households, such as single-headed households (especially with a
female head) and those with a large number of dependents, tend to fare worse.
Social networks help households manage risk and access formal and informal
SSNs.30 Participants in many programs reported increased participation in community
meetings and social events as well as improvements in trust and in the degree of integration with their communities. For previously marginalized households, these social
networks improved living conditions in both tangible ways, such as access to information and opportunities as well as cooperation in the form of labor sharing, cooperative
cash cropping, and informal finance (Blattman et al. 2016), and intangible ways, such
as by shaping attitudes and aspirations for the future (Macours and Vakis 2014). Some
programs increased access to other government social programs and services (Escobal
and Ponce 2016; Kochar et al. 2020). At the same time, there were also negative impacts
in terms of resentment and abuse, loss of informal means of support, and sometimes
even theft by nonparticipating households, particularly in contexts with limited natural
resources (Siddiki et al. 2014) or rigid social hierarchies (Kabeer et al. 2012).
Shocks can halt or even reverse progress toward economic inclusion, but this effect
is tempered by household resilience. In many programs, households that were unable
to improve or maintain their socioeconomic situation (decliners or crash outs) were
adversely affected by a series of shocks that overwhelmed their ability to cope. While
shocks upended many upward trajectories, some households (improvers) had the resilience to overcome these setbacks and rebuild their livelihoods. This greater resilience
was due to better risk management (in terms of greater diversification) and reliance on
nonerosive coping strategies. However, the ability to diversify incomes itself depends
on attitudes to risk and skills, some level of capital to invest in alternative activities,
and household labor availability, while nonerosive coping mechanisms require some
resources and access to credit and social networks.31 For instance, in Haiti’s Kore Lavi
program, participants who had joined village savings and loans associations were more
likely to adopt resilient coping strategies (CARE 2019). These are important levers for
economic inclusion programs to influence.
Individual characteristics, such as education and experience, are also important in
differentiating participant trajectories. Participants with some prior experience, especially business experience, are able to make more informed decisions about livelihood
options offered by economic inclusion programs and to increase their returns. This
is particularly important for programs promoting self-employment. For instance, in
Bangladesh’s TUP, while most participants were able to move to self-employment in
the short to medium term, only existing entrepreneurs managed to sustain their business (relative to nonparticipants) in the long term (Misha et al. 2019). In many cases,
particularly complementary programs, participants are typically selected based on an
assessment of capability, employability, and business acumen of potential participants
(see chapter 3). Even then, differences in education can impact income gains (Aldana,
Vásquez, and Yancari 2016) and employment outcomes (Acosta and Avalos 2018). Some
programs found younger participants benefited more than older participants, and, in
some cases, positive income and labor supply impact was experienced only by younger
and more educated participants (Almeida and Galasso 2010).
Program trajectories are often gendered, with intrahousehold dynamics and
gender norms constraining progress toward economic inclusion. For women, social
norms, labor availability, and relationship dynamics in the household are important
138

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

determinants of participant trajectories and overall program impact. In Rwanda, maleheaded households were better placed to take up new opportunities, leading to greater
improvements in assets and food security relative to female-headed households. For
instance, examining asset trajectories, only 36 percent of households grouped as
improvers were female-headed, compared to 29 percent of decliners and 56 percent
of crash outs (Sabates-Wheeler, Sabates, and Devereux 2018). The reverse was true in
Bangladesh, where the program targeted women. In this case, female-headed households substantially increased their incomes in the short term, relative to male-headed
households, and were able to match them over time (Misha et al. 2019).
At the same time, personal agency and noncognitive abilities, such as drive, initiative, risk taking, and an entrepreneurial spirit, can also put some individuals and their
households on a path of sustained income generation. This is particularly relevant for
programs promoting self-employment. Many participants are self-employed by necessity; only some participants are self-employed by choice and have the necessarily entrepreneurial experience and traits to succeed (see chapter 3). In the Sahel subregion,
for example, many focus group participants associated behavioral skills such as being
hard working, determined, and courageous with success in farm or nonfarm activities
(Bossuroy, Koussoubé, and Premand 2019). In West Bengal, indigenous women were
among the fast climbers, despite being the most marginalized group and despite dealing
with resentment and barriers to advancement in their communities. This was largely
because they viewed the program as their only chance to improve their situation, while
the self-help group approach taken by the program helped forge strong horizontal social
bonds (Kabeer et al. 2012). In complementary programs, differences in the take-up
of various constituent components in the program can also influence overall impact
(Escobal and Ponce 2016).

Future Directions
This synthesis makes a strong case for the potential of a broad range of economic inclusion programs to impact a wide range of outcomes across diverse contexts. While the
first round of evidence came from NGO-led programs, a new wave of evidence will
soon emerge from government-led operations, which are increasingly moving to scale.
There is a need to ensure that this emerging evidence base balances long-term evidence
generation with monitoring and learning that ultimately strengthens program performance in real time. In this context, key priorities going forward are as follows:32
First, a more systematic evidence base, using comparable outcomes and indicators,
would conclusively establish the overall impact of economic inclusion programming
across all three entry points, at scale, and over time. In this context, greater effort is
needed to expand the evidence base to evaluate the following programs:
• SSN-plus and FI programs
• Government-led programs33
• Programs operating in FCV settings
In addition to the upcoming coordinated research agendas (see appendix B), the
next wave of evaluations could draw on the framework presented in chapter 1 to identify common research questions and report on a common set of outcomes and indicators. Depending on study comparability, a meta-analysis could combine evidence from
multiple evaluations to provide estimates of effect sizes, disaggregated by program
entry points, institutional arrangements, program size, and context. The evidence base
on the long-term sustainability of impacts also needs to be broadened beyond the
139

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

current small set of programs. In particular, there is little information on the long-term
impact of government-led programsprograms and on the nature of “refresher” interventions and other support that may be required for sustained long-term income growth
for the poorest. Finally, addressing existing knowledge gaps will require complementing
impact evaluations with real-time operational research (such as constraints analysis and
other diagnostic studies, performance monitoring, process evaluations, etc.) to identify opportunities to enhance program design and performance. Beyond knowing what
works in terms of cost-effectiveness and scalability, program implementers need greater
understanding on how to operationalize programs and make them work.
Second, a critical learning agenda is investigating differences in program impact
across population groups and understanding the factors driving differences in beneficiary trajectories across fast climbers, slow climbers, and crash outs. About 39 percent
of programs that reported undertaking an impact evaluation in the PEI Landscape
Survey 2020 plan to evaluate customized bundles for different groups. This will require
supplementing impact evaluations with operational research to allow cost-effective
program customization to suit different characteristics and constraints (see box 6.2
in the next chapter for some emerging evidence on these strategies). A key priority is
reconciling the differences between quantitative and qualitative research with respect to
impact on women and children. This is critical to design economic inclusion programs
that amplify positive impacts (such as personal empowerment and human capital
and intergenerational outcomes), avoid unintended negative impacts (such as genderbased violence and child labor), and potentially course-correct and customize support
depending on beneficiary trajectories.34
Third, the next wave of evaluations needs to help unpack the bundling of interventions. Although the emerging evidence suggests that bundling interventions is critical for impact, this comes with higher cost and complexity (see chapter 6). Further
research is necessary to identify the marginal contribution of constituent interventions to overall impact, the role of timing and sequencing in maximizing the impact of
a bundled set of interventions, and corresponding implications for cost-effectiveness.
This knowledge would benefit operational teams in identifying a bundle that is well
sequenced, appropriate to the context, and retains the positive impact of the program at
a lower cost. This is particularly important for the scalability of high-cost interventions,
such as coaching and training, whose marginal contribution to overall cost-­effectiveness
we do not yet know.35
Fourth, program evaluations need to be part of broader program monitoring,
evaluation, and learning agendas. Supplementing impact evaluations with process
evaluations and operational research would enable a deeper understanding of the
mechanisms of impact, particularly the role of implementation and overall program
performance, both for programs with proven impact and those with no discernible
impact. In particular, impact and process evaluations of alternative program delivery
models can help identify workable solutions for a variety of program innovations and
refinements for a range of contexts, including, for instance, technology-based solutions
in hard-to-reach contexts. This has taken on greater urgency in light of the COVID-19
containment measures.

Notes
1. This synthesis must be offered with one note of caution: the results presented here are

unavoidably subject to publication bias, as publications usually present only positive findings.
It should also be noted that this is not a meta-analysis, and consequently we cannot present
estimates of average impact across programs.

2. SSN-plus refers to social safety nets–plus, where the “plus” is additional inputs, service

components, or links to external services, that complement the cash transfer. There is also a
significant gap with respect to FI interventions, which largely mirrors the fact that this is often
a secondary, rather than primary, entry point (see chapter 2).
3. As highlighted in chapter 2, stand-alone SSN interventions—like cash transfers—have
shown an array of productive impacts, although sometimes with small size effects and
often when these were not an explicit program objective. SSNs have led to investments
in agricultural assets, inputs and livestock, business and enterprise, and savings, besides
improving well-being (in terms of consumption, food security, and human capital)
(Bastagli et al. 2016; Ralston, Andrews, and Hsiao 2017; Davis et al. 2016; O’Keefe, Dutta,
and Palacios 2020).
4. These feature well-known SSNs, such as Ethiopia’s productive safety nets program (linked to
the Household Asset Building Program) and Brazil’s Bolsa Família (linked to the agricultural
credit program, Pronaf).
5. Of the total number of programs surveyed for this report, 80 percent have not yet been
evaluated, as most are relatively recent.
6. Program duration: For ease of comparability across studies, we define short-term impact as
measured immediately after a program concludes or in one to two years after program start
(that is, when beneficiaries enroll in the program); medium term as three to four years after
program start; and long term as four or more years after program start.
7. Examples include the following: the CGAP–Ford Foundation pilots in Ethiopia, Honduras,
Ghana, India, Pakistan, and Peru increased total asset value by 0.26 standard deviations
relative to the baseline (Banerjee et al. 2015); Paraguay’s Sembrando Oportunidades
Familia por Familia increased total asset value by 0.31 standard deviations relative to that
of nonparticipants (and 0.42 standard deviations compared to the baseline of participants)
(Maldonado et al. 2019); and Afghanistan’s TUP program increased livestock assets and
household assets by 1.06 and 0.36 standard deviations, respectively, relative to nonparticipants
(Bedoya et al. 2019).
8. In Afghanistan, where women’s labor participation is very low, the TUP program increased
women’s labor participation (including market work, self-employment, or job searching) by
22 percentage points (above a 35 percent average among nonparticipants) (Bedoya et al. 2019).
In Tanzania’s PSSN, for example, women were 7.6 percentage points more likely to work on
nonfarm activities relative to nonparticipating women. Men, however, were 6.5 percentage
points more likely to work on farm activities relative to other men (Rosas et al. 2019).
9. For example, Kenya’s REAP increased the per capita income of participating groups by 34
percent (0.246 standard deviations) compared to nonparticipating groups (Gobin, Santos, and
Toth 2016). In the six CGAP–Ford Foundation pilots, participating households increased their
total income by 0.383 standard deviations (Banerjee et al. 2015).
10. Only 15 studies report on child health outcomes and 20 studies on education outcomes.
In Bangladesh, TUP improved nutrition, reducing the likelihood of being underweight for
children under 5 years of age by 10 percentage points (Raza, Van de Poel, and van Ourti
2018). Although older children increased hours spent on own-family livestock rearing and
cultivation, this did not crowd out schooling (Bandiera et al. 2017). Haiti’s Chemen Lavi Miyò
program resulted in no reduction in care for children and reduced the occurrence of children
being sent to work as domestic help (Roelen and Saha 2019), while Burkina Faso’s Trickle Up
program reduced children’s exposure to hazardous work (Karimli, Bose, and Kagotho 2019).
See Roelen, Sherer, and Himmelstine (2020) for a review of impact on children.
11. A qualitative evaluation of Rwanda’s Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme found increased
usage of insurance products due to links made through the program (Gahamanyi and
Kettlewell 2015). Similarly, Tanzania’s PSSN increased take-up of health insurance, with 33
percent of participating households enrolled in a health insurance plan compared to just 11
percent of nonparticipating households (Rosas et al. 2019).
12. These results should be at best treated as indicative of the possible directions of programs, as
long-term evidence up to seven years is limited to two programs (and an experiment) and up
to nine to ten years to three programs only (see box 5.1).
13. Existing entrepreneurs managed to sustain their business (relative to nonparticipants) even
nine years after program exit. However, households that had engaged primarily in begging or
141

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

in domestic or casual wage work were able to sustain their newly created businesses only in
the medium term. After nine years, the majority of these households had fallen back to their
original employment (Misha et al. 2019). See box 3.3 in chapter 3 on differential profiles of
reluctant and transformational entrepreneurs.
14. The long-term impact of stand-alone interventions, including SSNs, is also not yet
conclusively established. See, for example, Millán et al. (2019).
15. This is a key concern in scaling up social policy. For stand-alone interventions (including
SSNs, microcredit, financial literacy, and women’s empowerment programs), there is
some evidence of heterogeneity in effect sizes across programs, with smaller effect sizes
in government-led programs relative to experiments or NGO-led programs (Vivalt 2019).
The evidence on economic inclusion programs at scale is more limited and, given the diversity
in programs, we cannot compare effect sizes.
16. In Andhra Pradesh, Indira Kranti Pratham (IKP); in Bihar, JEEViKA (see case study 2).
17. About 80 percent of Haku Wiñay families and 60 percent of PxMF families received
consumption support through the existing conditional cash transfer programs (Juntos and Más
Familias en Acción, respectively) (Sheldon 2016).
18. In Brazil, Bolsa Família and Pronaf (Garcia, Helfand, and Souza 2016); in El Salvador,
Comunidades Solidarias Rurales and Fondo de Inversión Social para el Desarrollo (de Sanfeliú,
Ángel, and Shi 2016); in Peru, Juntos and agricultural credit (Loayza 2015).
19. In Brazil, Bolsa Família and the International Fund for Agricultural Development rural
development program (Costa, Helfand, and Souza 2018); in Colombia, Familias en Acción and
Oportunidades Rurales (Moya 2016); in Mexico, Prospera and Procampo (Yúnez-Naude et al.
2016); in Chile, Ingreso Ético Familiar (IEF) and enterprise support programs (El Fondo de
Solidaridad e Inversión Social, FOSIS) (Fernández et al. 2016); in Kenya, Hunger Safety Net
Program and index-based livestock insurance (Jensen, Barrett, and Mude 2017). The programs
examined in these studies predate more comprehensive economic inclusion programming in
some of the countries (notably, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico).
20. See footnote 3 for evidence on stand-alone SSNs. The evidence on active labor market
programs (including business grants and training) is mixed. For instance, training programs
are likely to have a positive effect on post-program employment rates but not necessarily on
earnings, at least in developing countries (Kluve 2016; Betcherman, Olivas, and Dar 2004;
Ibarraran and Shady 2009; Card, Kluve, and Weber 2015). It is possible that effects may be
more positive for women, especially if constraints on accessibility and child care are addressed
(Buvinic and Furst-Nichols 2014), but many would not pass a cost-benefit test (Blattman
and Ralston 2015; McKenzie 2017). The small evidence base for farmer field schools suggests
impact on knowledge and practices, as well as agricultural production and farmers’ incomes,
at least in small pilot projects (Waddington et al. 2014). Financial services such as savings,
insurance, and, to a lesser extent, payments have substantial positive impact on building
household resilience and empowering poor women; the evidence on other services, such as
credit, is more mixed and contextual (El-Zoghbi, Holle, and Soursourian 2019).
21. There may also be important noneconomic benefits. For instance, in Burkina Faso’s Trickle Up
livelihood program, supplementing the classic graduation package with family coaching on
child protection issues improved children’s mental health functioning, fostered a supportive
parenting environment, and reduced exposure to family violence (Karimli, Rost, and
Ismayilova 2018; Ismayilova et al. 2018).
22. About 20 percent of Haku Wiñay participants did not qualify for the conditional cash transfer
(Juntos) and so did not receive regular cash transfers for consumption support. There were
also differences in interventions offered and take-up.
23. Households that received training with the asset transfer were more likely to produce milk
(approximately 1.5 liters of milk more per day relative to less than 1 liter per day); this
translated into a $0.82 increase in household income from milk, equivalent to about 66
percent of an untrained household’s daily income.
24. All variants had a positive impact on child outcomes (Macours, Schady, and Vakis 2012).
25. Emerging evidence from BRAC’s CFPR-TUP (Das et al. 2016) and Côte d’Ivoire’s PRISE
(Premand and Marguerie 2020) provide some insights with respect to program variants with a
cash grant versus a credit or semicredit (chapter 6).

26. See chapter 3 for a review of the global landscape of economic inclusion programs and chapter 6

for a detailed discussion on adequacy and component costs for a subset of programs.
27. This chapter does not investigate program performance to understand the extent to which

deviations from the intended program design may drive impact.
28. For instance, Chile sought to complement its social protection program (IEF) with

entrepreneurship through a public service (FOSIS) but had no impact. It is possible that the
IEF beneficiaries (poor elderly and people living in the streets) did not have the right profile,
with limited means or skills to participate in the business proposal contests required to access
the FOSIS programs (Fernández et al. 2016). Similarly, the lack of aggregate impact of the
Oportunidades and Procampo programs in Mexico between 2002 and 2007 may have been
due to differences in their target populations; Procampo beneficiaries were not necessarily
poor and hence not covered by Oportunidades (Yúnez-Naude et al. 2016).
29. Household and individual characteristics also play a role in explaining heterogeneity. See case
study 4.
30. These include horizontal networks, which can provide financial support and share business
expertise, and vertical networks, which facilitate opportunities and access to credit and
government programs.
31. See Smith et al. (2019) for an analysis of resilience capacity among pastoralist beneficiaries of
the PRIME program in drought-prone areas of Ethiopia.
32. Some of these will be addressed through the upcoming research pipeline (appendix B).
33. While the emerging evidence on the short- and medium-term impact of government-led
programs is promising, many programs continue to rely largely on nonevaluative performance
assessments. Among programs that reported undertaking an impact evaluation in the PEI
Landscape Survey 2020, about 26 percent are planning to evaluate impact at scale.
34. For instance, Innovations for Policy Action (IPA) and Village Enterprise are planning to
evaluate the impact of a livelihood program in Ghana on intimate-partner violence and
women’s empowerment. About 5 percent of the programs reporting a planned impact
evaluation in the PEI Landscape Survey 2020 plan to evaluate intergenerational impact.
35. A subset of programs that reported undertaking an impact evaluation in the PEI Landscape
Survey 2020 plan to evaluate the impact of various bundles (40 percent), sequencing
(10 percent), impact on noncognitive skills (4 percent), and the marginal impact of some
interventions (such as market links, 15 percent). For instance, IPA, Heifer International, and
the Ford Foundation are planning to evaluate the impact of alternative bundles (including
cognitive behavioral therapy) in Ghana. Upcoming multicountry research on SSN-plus
bundling in the Sahel also seeks to answer these questions (Bossuroy et al. 2019).

CHAPTER 6
Assessing the Cost of Economic
Inclusion Programs
KEY MESSAGES
This chapter provides one of the first standardized multicountry cost disaggregations of
government- and nongovernment-led economic inclusion programs ­globally. The analysis has real-time value for policy dialogue and is based on a newly d
­ eveloped Partnership
for Economic Inclusion (PEI) Quick Costing Tool 2020 applied across 34 programs globally.
This costing analysis is a critical step toward understanding cost optimization and
cost-effectiveness in economic inclusion programs. Costing discussions have been
fraught with methodological challenges and minimal ­available information.
The cost of economic inclusion programs tends to be driven by a single intervention, such as cash grants, asset or input transfers, or social safety net (SSN) transfers.
Human resource and staff costs are more prominent cost drivers in complex projects,
whose costs are driven by multiple components, rather than those driven by one
component.
Program “sticker prices” can be misleading and mask considerable heterogeneity.
The price range of the economic inclusion programs sampled varies substantially
depending on design and target groups. Sticker prices need to be understood based
on their adequacy and impact.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
There is a strong operational demand to better understand cost effectiveness and
program sustainability. The PEI Quick Costing Tool 2020 provides a simple starting
point to frame these debates. The tool will evolve as further evidence and know-how
emerges.
Researchers assessing the impact of economic inclusion programs should
­systematically collect and report on cost data in addition to impact sizes.
The ­systematic understanding of costs will allow governments to make sense of
program cost-benefit ratios and guide their policy choices.
Reliable costing data offer considerable scope to further understand cost
­optimization. Optimizing costs includes, but is not limited to, ­variations in size and cost
recovery of cash grants; variations in intensity of ­modality, frequency, and content of
training; and in coaching.

Introduction

P

olicy discourse on economic inclusion programs has typically focused on the
pursuit of a “sticker price” to identify investment worthiness or cost-­effectiveness.
A reframing of the expectations regarding both a sticker price approach and the
utility of cost data is overdue.
Various impact evaluation studies (Bedoya et al. 2019; Ara et al. 2017; Bauchet,
Morduch, and Ravi 2015; Banerjee et al. 2015; Bandiera et al. 2013) have tried to determine the cost of economic inclusion programs (see appendix B for a full list of impact
evaluation studies), and some have also assessed the cost-effectiveness of them by estimating their internal rate of return. A review of these studies reveals a large variation in
cost per beneficiary, between $41 and $2,253 (in 2011 purchasing power parity, PPP).1
One estimate that considers the size of an asset transfer required to escape poverty
(a poverty-trap-based estimation) finds the appropriate size is $504 (in 2007 PPP)
(Balboni et al. 2020). Given the variations in costs, it is important to reset expectations
of a sticker price by undertaking a detailed and standardized costing survey that goes
beyond a cost-effectiveness assessment.
Program cost analysis is a critical tool to inform not just cost-effectiveness but
also program design decisions. Assessing program costs can enable policy makers and
program designers to identify limitations and opportunities to inform program activity
and policies. To begin with, total program costs are defined as including the following:
• The direct cost of each benefit provided to the beneficiaries of a program
• The indirect cost of providing those benefits, such as administrative or implementation costs and beneficiary identification costs
• The direct cost associated with the beneficiaries’ participation in program activities,
such as their travel costs or the cost of enrolling in a mobile wallet service to receive
cash transfers in electronic form
• The opportunity cost of beneficiaries’ participation in program activities, including the monetized value of time that they forego from other productive activities in
order to attend program activities
Disaggregating total program costs can enable programs to assess the affordability
and scale of a project with available resources or understand the relative cost share of
each component.
Disaggregated costing analysis entails the disaggregation of the total cost of a program
into the categories noted as well as any further disaggregation. The latter could include the
indirect cost of providing benefits, the costs of implementation at the national versus province or district level, and the direct cost of each program component benefit. This analysis can be done on a yearly basis or, for rapidly evolving programs and policy contexts, in
shorter timeframes. As discussed in chapter 1, economic inclusion programs tend to be
quite varied even as they all focus on providing a multipronged intervention to the poor.
The process of correctly designing an appropriate economic inclusion program can be
quite complex and cumbersome, and information on cost structures can provide important
guidance to designing such a program and broader policy making, as in the case of other
poverty alleviation transfer programs (Caldés, Coady, and Maluccio 2006).
Cost-effectiveness analysis is particularly important for economic inclusion interventions, given that it involves multiple components. Cost-effectiveness analysis is the estimation of the return from the program cost from an investment point of view, and, depending
on the quality of impact data available, it could be disaggregated. This type of analysis is
particularly important for economic inclusion programs as they rely on layering multiple
interventions. While this multiplicity brings greater impact (chapter 5), it also brings greater
153

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

administrative complexity (chapters 3 and 4) and potentially higher costs. Undertaking
a cost-effectiveness analysis can, therefore, be quite informative in terms of whether the
impact generated by a bundled intervention is worth the investment. But there are various
methodological limitations, as discussed in the following sections, that can render cost-­
effectiveness analysis less convincing and useful. Moreover, such analysis cannot be undertaken regularly, given the data requirements. Cost-effectiveness analysis will typically be
undertaken with an impact evaluation, which can take three to five years to implement.
Costing data on economic inclusion programs is minimally available and largely
incomplete when disaggregated. Only 20 out of 76 impact studies noted in chapter
5 report on total cost, and only 15 of them provide some form of disaggregation. At
the same time, programs implemented by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
are disproportionately represented, compared to the universe of programs presented
in chapter 3, with 19 of these 20 studies reporting on NGO programs. Of those that
provide disaggregated data, grant, asset transfer, and consumption support tend to
be the most commonly reported intervention, constituting between 15 percent and
67 percent (with an average of 38 percent) of total cost.
Cost-effectiveness studies have some methodological challenges that make
cross-context analyses challenging for the following reasons:
• Many social programs tend to have multiple objectives, some of which are not quantifiable and hence remain unaccounted for in cost-effectiveness studies.
• Measurement methodologies can vary across studies and contexts, resulting in the
benefits of an intervention being constructed differently than in others and hence
being incomparable. For example, to quantify benefits, Bandiera et al. (2017) use
household consumption, whereas Blattman et al. (2016) use total household nondurable consumption, while Banerjee et al. (2015) use nondurable consumption, assets,
and total consumption, varying by year of estimation.
• Contexts and target groups are not always comparable.
• The quality of impact and cost data may vary across programs.
• Inaccurate assumptions about the long-term sustainability of impacts may easily
be made. For instance, Kidd and Athias (2019) discuss how both Banerjee et al.
(2015) and Bandiera et al. (2013) assume that the gains from the program they
studied would last every year until the death of a beneficiary, despite there being
mixed evidence of long-term sustainability of impacts. As a result, comparisons
across programs can be quite imperfect and may not capture the full value of a
program.
The PEI Quick Costing Tool 2020 was developed to demystify the cost of economic
inclusion programs. As detailed in the following text, the focus of this survey is on
understanding the more operational aspects of economic inclusion programming rather
than just the cost-benefit analysis. The survey is also expected to serve as a template,
with revisions and the benefit of hindsight, for similar future exercises. The objective
of this exercise is to develop an early understanding of the range of costs of economic
inclusion programs and the cost drivers, including the complexity of the programs and
the modality of delivery, the costs of delivering these interventions, and the underlying intervention costs and dosage. Note that this costing exercise is limited to the
direct cost of each benefit provided to the beneficiaries and the indirect cost of providing those benefits, defined in this introduction’s third paragraph, and therefore does
not include beneficiary costs of participation due to the time requirements of collecting these data points. As desirable as it may be to do so, this report does not include a
cost-benefit analysis—due to the lack of simultaneous availability of impact data for the
programs that reported on cost—but it does reflect on some existing literature.

The PEI Quick Costing Tool 2020
For the PEI Quick Costing Tool 2020, PEI gathered and analyzed self-reported cost
data from 34 programs globally, ensuring that the programs represented a mix of
income, geographic, and sociopolitical contexts as well as implementation modalities.
These programs are from 25 countries, primarily from Sub-Saharan Africa and South
Asia together with a few each from the other regions. While 24 of these programs are
government-led, 10 are NGO-led.2 In terms of program typologies, 12 are social safety
net (SSN) and 22 are livelihoods and jobs (L&J) programs. About 8 of these programs
are implemented in contexts of fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV), as defined by
the World Bank. A summary of the programs for which cost information was received
is included in table 6.1 by operational lead, region, and context, and compared to the
sample of programs in the Partnership for Economic Inclusion Landscape Survey 2020
in chapter 3. Appendix C has additional information.

The cost data reported by program teams are for the full integrated package of
layered interventions. This naturally brings up the issue of attribution to the economic
inclusion program, as there could be costs linked to other underlying programs that
may be included or, depending on the bookkeeping practices in-country, excluded from
the reported costs. To the extent possible, the costs have been disaggregated through
further consultations with the task team and a review of program documents, as
detailed below. Note that there are specific cost categories that are less amenable than
others to this disaggregation approach. These include staff costs (for administrative and
intervention delivery), monitoring and evaluation costs, and targeting costs. Box 6.1
provides further details on some issues with the costing survey.

BOX 6.1

Complications and Limitations of the PEI Quick Costing Tool 2020

While some of the following issues are inherent to the costing of economic inclusion
programs, others are common to any costing exercise for any set of programs, particularly when undertaken in a short timeframe.
Comparability across economic inclusion programs. Economic inclusion programs
vary quite substantially depending on target beneficiaries, the set of constraints they try
to tackle, the choice of constituent instruments, and how they intend to incorporate the
latter into a consolidated economic inclusion package. For example, social protection
programs that provide consumption support, grants, and skills training targeted explicitly at the extreme poor are quite distinct from agriculture programs that incentivize the
formation of productive alliances and provide matching grants to poor farmers.
Variations in cost-accounting standards and in levels of data disaggregation. The
costing survey sought to gather detailed information on each intervention broken
down by its various elements, such as direct benefit cost, cost of monitoring, and cost
of targeting. The cost-accounting and monitoring systems varied by project, as did the
level of disaggregation of available data.
Complications with assigning costs to administrative expenses. Except for interventions
that directly transfer a certain amount of benefit to the target group (for example, cash
grants and transfers), many interventions of economic inclusion programs have constituent
cost items that look like administrative expenses but are actually part of the direct implementation costs. For example, staff costs and travel per diem costs represent a major set
of cost items in implementing skills training and savings groups. These are also the key
components of administrative costs, which makes it difficult to isolate administrative costs
from implementation costs. Ideally, administrative cost would be defined as any portion of
staff and travel per diem costs that is not used for direct program implementation, but the
current analysis does not undertake this estimation exercise. Hence, costs reported as staff
cost by programs is reported in this analysis as “delivery and staff cost” to be true to what
this cost category includes. Box 6.2 cites details of a separate costing exercise undertaken
by the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program, which distinguishes between administrative costs and direct program implementation costs.
Exclusion of some government costs directly linked to project. Many government-led
economic inclusion projects are jointly implemented by government staff and project
implementation units comprised of consultants recruited for this purpose. The costing

data received from such projects typically exclude the government staff costs, among
them the staff costs of government employees at headquarters and at other, decentralized levels. This exclusion is due to complications with obtaining such data from ministries
as well as estimating staff time and cost allocations to a project because government staff
tend to be engaged on multiple projects and tasks as part of their duties.
Exclusion of opportunity costs and hidden costs of participation. The cost estimations
do not include the opportunity cost of beneficiaries’ participation in the program, nor do
they include the costs incurred to attend training sessions or travel to payment points to
receive cash grants. These exclusions apply to both monetary and time costs.
Cost-effectiveness analysis limited by lack of simultaneous access to impact assessment results. Of the 35 projects that reported costing information, impact evaluation
results are available for only 1 project at the time of this writing, namely, the National
Rural Livelihoods Program in India (Kochar et al. 2020).

The analysis of costing data, supplemented by details from program documents, is
largely descriptive in nature and uses various robustness checks for quality assurance.
Figure 6.1 is a sample template of programs’ costing data. A multipronged approach was
used for quality assurance. First, to supplement and rationalize findings from the cost
survey data analysis, the PEI team uses project appraisal documents, operations manuals, and information available on program websites. Second, a sensitivity analysis was
157

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

done on the PPP conversions to check if specific years may be biasing the cost trends
across countries. Third, the team undertook multiple detailed discussions with each country team or organization to confirm data and analysis: (1) right after the raw data was
received from each program, (2) after the initial cross-program draft analysis was undertaken, and (3) after this chapter was written. Fourth, findings are included from another
independently undertaken costing exercise by the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection
Program (SASPP), which was conducted over a longer period of time and uses a more
sophisticated costing tool. It is described in box 6.2 as a comparison and to add nuance to
some of the findings (for example, on staff costs) from the PEI Quick Costing Tool 2020.
Fifth, extensive consultations were undertaken with technical experts at the World Bank
and the Partnership for Economic Inclusion network to ground-truth the findings.

BOX 6.2 E
 conomic Inclusion Program Costs in the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection
Program (SASPP)
A thorough costing exercise was undertaken across the four countries that implemented
the productive measures developed as part of the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection
Program (SASPP) (Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal). The Sahel ASP Program
developed a rigorous costing template to clearly break down costs for each specific intervention and costs related to program administration. For each component, the key cost
items, such as transport, equipment, materials, housing, and restoration, are listed and
informed by project teams and social safety net (SSN) agencies. Management and supervision costs were factored in, including the time costs for all staff involved in the country
program (from the government, nongovernmental organization (NGO) partners, or the
World Bank). This allows for a very precise estimation of the cost of each intervention and
for separately reporting administrative or nonintervention-specific costs.
The total cost of the productive measures amounts to about $250–260 (2011 $235–246 at
purchasing power parity, PPP) per beneficiary in Niger and Burkina Faso, $430 (2011 $407
PPP) in urban Senegal, and $570 (2011 $446 PPP) in Mauritania. The cash grant was the
largest cost driver, accounting for between 40 percent (Mauritania) and 70 percent (Burkina
Faso) of the total cost of implementation. It was calibrated based on international experience to about 70 percent of the annual household consumption of beneficiaries. The cost
of the grants largely reflects the cost of living in the different contexts. The training components, including life skills and microentrepreneurship trainings, were delivered for $50–100
per beneficiary depending on the country.
Beyond the cost of living, the main differences across countries reflect the scale of operations but also the level of integration of the program with national SSN systems. Scale
mattered: per capita nonintervention costs were higher in Mauritania, which established the
program for about 2,000 household beneficiaries, than in Burkina Faso, which delivered it
to almost 18,000 households. The existence of established delivery systems also enabled
the program to minimize costs related to the identification of beneficiaries, the constitution
of groups, and the delivery of repeated frontline services, such as savings facilitation and
coaching. In Niger and Senegal, where community volunteers were trained and supervised
by local program staff, the savings and coaching components cost under $20 per beneficiary. In Mauritania, where qualified NGO workers provided those services with a much
higher ratio of beneficiaries to providers, the same activities cost $180. Similarly, administrative costs, which include monitoring and evaluation and targeting costs, were lower in
contexts that made use of existing systems. See figure B6.2.1 for details by program.

Overall Cost of Economic Inclusion Programs
The overall price tag for economic inclusion programs varies substantially, and the “sticker
price” approach to costing economic inclusion programs can be faulty. The total cost of
economic inclusion programs is between $41 and $2,253 (in 2011 PPP) per beneficiary over
the duration (3.6 years on average) of each program.3 This variance continues when the
programs are further broken down by entry points (see figure 6.2): SSN programs range
from $77 to $2,253 (2011 PPP) and, L&J programs range from $41 to $2,076 (2011 PPP).
The variation is higher for SSN programs. The Afghanistan Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP)
program is not included in the analysis in this chapter, as it is deemed to be an outlier due
to its substantially higher cost per beneficiary despite being tagged as an L&J program.
Along similar lines, the cost per beneficiary for NGO-implemented programs in the survey,
all classified as L&J, ranges from $41 to $778 (2011 PPP). Note that these variations in
program costs reflect their different objectives and design elements, including the intervention dosage or adequacy, sequencing, duration of interventions, programmatic contexts, and
target beneficiary groups. For example, NGO program costs for L&J programs are in a lower
range than L&J government programs. This comparison, however, can be quite misleading
as the target group may be different. For example, Argentina’s Socio-economic Inclusion
in Rural Areas Project (Proyecto de Inclusión Socio-Económica en Áreas Rurales, PISEAR)
provides matching grants of larger sizes to its producer groups, that consist of less poor but

vulnerable family producers, whereas many of the NGO programs target the ultrapoor individually. Moreover, it must also be recognized that there are likely other NGO programs that
have a higher range of cost than that reported here, driven either by the context in which
they operate (especially in FCV settings) or their design.
While the cost and impact relationship is unclear, it is worth considering if there is a
minimum dosage threshold below which programs should be deemed to not have the type
of impact necessary to meet their objectives. For example, perhaps, programs costing less

than $400 (2011 PPP) per beneficiary have a lower range of impact than programs costing
more than this threshold. While this is likely, it is important to note that lower unit costs are
a factor not only of program design but also of program evolution. Some of these programs,
such as the Third Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF3) in Uganda and the
Support Rural Income Generation of the Poorest in the Upper East Region Project (SRIGP)
in Ghana, have relatively new programs under implementation within larger SSN programs.
These programs will likely mature and develop into more sophisticated and costly economic
inclusion programs as the economic inclusion sector in these countries develop.

Bundling of Interventions and Complexity
Even though economic inclusion programs are multisectoral, in many cases their cost is
driven by a single component. This is likely a result of the evolution of such programs or
due to a mechanism used to reduce complexity in program management. Many economic
inclusion programs allocate between 50 and 86 percent of their overall cost to one component. These components tend to be either cash or in-kind transfers or wages through
public works programs in the case of SSN programs. For L&J and financial inclusion (FI)
programs, these components tend to be lump-sum cash grants or transfers of inputs or
assets. Figure 6.3 illustrates this pattern with more than a dozen program examples.
This dominance of a single component could be due to several reasons. First,
programs may build on existing interventions and then introduce smaller-scale add-ons
to improve the productive impact of the program as a whole, as in the case of the functional expansion of an SSN program. Second, program designers may view a multiplicity of interventions as potentially increasing complexity and hope that by prioritizing an
intervention that is less resource-intensive, the program management complexities and
costs can be minimized. Third, perhaps these components correspond to the identified
binding constraints to economic inclusion in these contexts.

The costs of SSN programs are slightly more frequently driven by a single component than the costs of L&J programs. On average, 60 percent of the total cost of SSN
programs consists of a single component, compared with 44 percent of the cost of L&J
programs. The cost differences are likely driven by the different evolutionary paths of
the two sets of programs, with SSN programs being driven by the legacy and objectives
of their foundational SSN programs. L&J programs, on the other hand, tend to have less
of this legacy and hence can be more squarely focused on resolving the multiplicity of
constraints to the beneficiaries’ economic inclusion.
Government-led programs’ costs are more often driven by a single component
than those of NGO-led programs. On average, across all government-led programs, the
cost share of the biggest component is 53 percent, whereas it is 37 percent across all
NGO-led programs. Even for rigorously evaluated NGO-led programs, the ­average cost
share of the biggest reported component is 33 percent of total program cost (Bandiera
et al. 2013, 2017; Bedoya et al. 2019; Blattman et al. 2016; Blattman, Dercon, and
Franklin 2019; Sedlmayr, Shah, and Sulaiman. 2019; Banerjee et al. 2015; Bauchet,
Morduch, and Ravi 2015; Ismayilova et al. 2018; Gobin, Santos, and Toth 2016). At the
same time, while 13 out of 24 government-led programs have a component that
constitutes half or more of the total program cost, that is the case for only 2 out of
10 NGO-led programs. NGO-led programs tend to be stand-alone programs and hence
have no programmatic legacies to build on, unlike government-led programs. At the
same time, they tend to be smaller in scale, in terms of beneficiaries and geographic
coverage, and they can therefore more easily afford (in both monetary and nonmonetary resources) to design and implement more complex interventions.
As expected, economic inclusion programs in more complex FCV contexts tend to be
less complex than those not in FCV contexts, that is, their cost structures are driven by a
single component. A majority of economic inclusion programs in these contexts (five out
of eight programs) have a single component that drives more than 50 percent of overall
costs. The average cost share of the biggest component in FCV contexts is 53 percent,
as compared with 47 percent in other contexts. FCV contexts (not programs) tend to be
more complex than other settings, because some of the basic infrastructure and capacity needed to design and implement programs may be missing. Nevertheless, these
programs continue to have a substantial number of components as they try to address
the severity of deprivations across multiple constraints to economic inclusion.
Delivery and staff costs tend to be lower for programs that fiscally prioritize one
component vis-à-vis those that prioritize multiple components. Key cost items in delivering
economic inclusion programs are those that are human resource intensive, such as savings
groups and training. As highlighted in box 6.1, this cost tends to be accounted as staff costs.
Most of the surveyed programs reported their total staff cost as comprised of the following:
• The cost of implementing certain components, such as savings groups and training
• The human resource cost of administering other components, such as grants, inputs,
and cash transfers
These will be referred to as delivery and staff costs. Delivery and staff costs
range between 1 percent and 45 percent of the total cost of economic inclusion
programs. On average, they account for 13 percent of overall cost for programs where
one component drives the majority of total costs (that is, less complex programs),
but 26 percent of overall program cost for programs that fiscally prioritize multiple
­components. Both government-led and NGO-led programs incur higher delivery and
staff costs, as a share of total program cost, for programs that fiscally prioritize multiple
­components—9 percent versus 16 percent for government-led programs and 26 percent
versus 32 percent for NGO-led programs. See figure 6.4 for program-specific data.

Delivery and staff cost incurred by SSN programs is lower than that incurred by L&J
programs. It is, on average, 10 percent of the total costs for SSN programs compared
to 18 percent of the total cost for L&J programs. While this trend is based on a small
subset of SSN programs, it likely reflects the existing SSN implementation infrastructure upon which the programming builds. In L&J programs themselves, these costs tend
to be higher for programs that are more complex, that is, those that fiscally prioritize
multiple program components.

Component Dosage and Adequacy
The following analysis is based on programs that provided disaggregated data on underlying components. The sample of programs, therefore, varies across different interventions. Components reported by three or fewer programs are not included. Adequacy
is calculated as cost ($ 2011 PPP) of a component (for example, grant size) divided by

average annual per capita consumption ($ 2011 PPP) of the bottom 20 percent of households in the relevant country.
Lumpy cash grants (lump-sum transfers for productive investments) are provided
more often and at higher value to beneficiaries in L&J programs than in SSN programs.
This differing method may reflect differences in the underlying objectives or primary
entry points between the two types of programs. L&J programs are squarely focused
on improving productive outcomes, whereas SSN initiatives primarily aim to improve
consumption and, for a subset of beneficiaries, their productive outcomes as well.
Fewer SSN programs provide any cash grants to their beneficiaries compared to L&J
programs. At the same time, the average grant size for SSN programs is $222 (2011
PPP), whereas for L&J programs it is $416 (2011 PPP), excluding Burkina Faso. By
design, Burkina Faso provides a substantially higher grant to youths selected through
business plan competitions to create small business and microenterprises, rather than
for self-employment. See table 6.2 for the range of grants and their adequacy.

L&J programs tend to provide cash grants in two installments as compared to one
installment by SSN programs. Installment payments are likely to reduce the income
effect on household consumption of receiving a large sum of money all at once, and
they may reduce chances of theft or fraud that may result from receiving a large sum of
money at once.
Some L&J programs provide larger grants as cofinancing to less poor but vulnerable producers as part of the customization of benefits to different groups. Note that
these are not included in table 6.2. Azerbaijan’s Internally Displaced Persons Living
Standards and Livelihood Project provides grants worth $1,469 (2011 PPP) per beneficiary to income-generating groups comprised on average of 11 people from the
community of internally displaced people (IDPs) with viable business plans.4 This
grant allows them to register and operate as local liability companies and open bank
accounts. The beneficiaries contribute their own savings, worth 5 percent of the
overall grant size, to these accounts, and each self-help group that reaches a required
savings threshold is then supported with a financial grant of not more than $15,000 to
start a new microenterprise. These business plans are typically higher-value-addition
activities, such as milk processing, incubation for egg production, and trade in agricultural machinery.
Similarly, Argentina’s PISEAR project, implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture,
provides matching grants to its beneficiaries, who are less poor than those who receive
lumpy cash grants, to enable them to form productive alliances between producer
groups and buyers. These grants average $3,144 (2011 PPP) per beneficiary household,
and producer groups are expected to cofinance a minimum of 30 percent of the total
cost of each productive alliance subproject. This is in addition to the lumpy cash grants
listed in table 6.2 that are provided to other poorer beneficiaries.
While asset and input transfers also seem more likely to be provided to beneficiaries of L&J programs than SSN beneficiaries, the actual value of transfers between
the two is similar. Most programs provide asset or input transfers worth between
$3.30 and $420 (2011 PPP) per beneficiary. The value of these transfers varies
substantially, likely driven by the value of the actual asset transferred, but also by
the contexts in which these transfers are made. For example, while some programs
provide small seed kits worth $3.30, others provide livestock worth $250 to $420,
and still others provide planting materials and seed and breed development services
worth $127 (all values in 2011 PPP). There are also programs that provide a substantially higher value of transfers, such as Azerbaijan’s Internally Displaced Persons
Living Standards and Livelihood Project, which provides for income-generating
activities. Sulaiman (2018) finds similar variability in in-kind transfer values across
contexts. See Table 6.2 for this range.
Regular cash transfers (consumption support) are provided by 40 percent of programs,
with SSN programs being more generous by virtue of providing them for longer periods of time. About 40 percent of the programs surveyed provide consumption support
through cash or in-kind transfers to their beneficiaries, with SSN programs providing
larger total benefits through longer regular transfers. The average value of consumption
support provided per capita per month by L&J programs is $8.80 (2011 PPP), while the
average amount provided by SSN programs is $5.70 (2011 PPP). While these figures are
comparable, it is noteworthy that SSN programs provide consumption support for a longer
period (28 months on average) than L&J programs do (14 months on average). Among
L&J programs, regular transfers are typically time bound, because they are supposed to
compensate for the opportunity costs of time consumed until the point when an income
stream from the livelihood activity starts up. By contrast, the regular transfers issued in

SSN programs are meant to provide for the basic consumption needs of beneficiaries and
for much longer. See table 6.4 for program-level details.
Similarly, programs that give beneficiaries access to public works jobs provide
wages in about the same range across the two program types, although with a greater
total benefit size through SSN programs. The average value of daily wages provided
by L&J programs and SSN programs is $5.60 and $4.30 (both in 2011 PPP), respectively (pegged to minimum wages in the country). The annual value of these wages,
which typically are earned for just the months of program participation, is equivalent

to 9 percent and 14 percent of the average consumption per capita per annum of the
poorest 20 percent of the respective country’s population. Yet SSN programs provide a
greater number of days of work, with more than 100 days compared to about 50 days
for L&J programs. The rationale for this is the same as that provided for cash and
in-kind transfers. See table 6.5 for program-level information.
Skills training, including vocational training, is another common intervention
provided to beneficiaries of economic inclusion programs, particularly in L&J programs.
These programs provide training to beneficiaries as a one-off intervention.5 The duration of trainings ranges from 1 to 30 days, with the average cost per beneficiary rising
with duration. Half of these trainings are provided at the individual or household level,
while the other half are provided to beneficiary groups and at the community level.
The content of such training may include human capital awareness-raising, life skills
training, microentrepreneurship, and grassroots management (for example, community
procurement and participatory evaluation of poverty and needs).
The cost per beneficiary of the formation of savings groups varies substantially across programs, likely stemming from differences in their duration. The major
limitation in analyzing the implementation cost of the savings group component is
that it is based on only four programs: the JEEViKA project (not including the Satat
Jeevikoparjan Yojana (SJY) included in case study 2) in Bihar, India; the National Rural

Livelihood Project (NRLP), under the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) in
India; and L&J programs implemented by Concern Worldwide in Malawi and Ethiopia.
While both programs in India cost about $331 per beneficiary over the total duration
of each program, the Concern Worldwide programs cost only $18 per beneficiary in
Ethiopia and $1.30 per beneficiary in Malawi (all amounts in 2011 PPP).
Even after taking program duration into account, the difference in cost per beneficiary per month is quite varied, likely because of their underlying objectives. The
programs in the NRLM focus sharply on improving financial access by providing capitalization support, resulting in improved productive outcomes, whereas the Concern
programs focus on improving productive outcomes through a simultaneous focus on
multiple constraints, with the lack of financial access being one. This is also evident
in the cost structure: savings groups constitute 50 percent of JEEViKA’s o
­ verall cost,
whereas the largest components of Concern Malawi and Concern Ethiopia constitute only
32 percent and 16 percent, respectively, of the overall cost.

Implementation Costs
Targeting
Economic inclusion programs often use a mix of targeting methods, and costs vary
substantially across programs. Overall, the targeting cost varies from as low as
0.3 percent, in Niger’s agriculture program, Programme d’Actions Communautaires, to
5.5 percent in Cameroon’s National Social Safety Net Project. L&J programs tend to use
a mix of geographical, categorical, and community-based targeting methods, while SSN
programs rely heavily on proxy means tests and community-based targeting. The choice
of targeting method likely depends on three factors:
1. The target population group under consideration
2. Any policy frameworks that dictate goals for targeting efficiency
3. The foundational program on which the economic inclusion program builds
Targeting costs are largely driven by household-based assessments, either household
surveys for categorical or poverty targeting (including registries) or intensively managed
community-based targeting. But higher costs are associated with some targeting methods
more than others—for example, they are higher with the inclusion of proxy means tests.
This trend is in line with Grosh (1994, 45), who finds that “the median total administrative costs as a share of total program costs were 9 percent for individual assessment,
7 percent for geographic targeting, and 6 percent for self-targeting.”
The targeting cost of SSN programs tends to be higher than that of L&J programs.
Notwithstanding the small sample size, the targeting cost of SSN programs is, on average, 4.5 percent, whereas it is 1.8 percent for L&J programs. The difference is largely
driven by the targeting needs of the broader SSN program, which must develop a
targeting process sufficient to build a robust SSN system. In fact, it is likely that the
majority of the reported targeting cost is attributable to the broader SSN component
of the program because of the difficulty of accounting for the marginal cost of selecting SSN beneficiaries for the additional economic inclusion component. The cost of
economic inclusion programs is lower when they use existing systems. Benin’s ACCESS
program and Niger’s PAC3 program build on existing SSN systems and on previous
phases of the project and thereby have seemingly lower targeting costs. This relationship with the use of existing systems is confirmed even when the more detailed costing
exercise undertaken by the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program is utilized. See
box 6.2 for this and other insights.

Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) costs are roughly similar for all L&J programs,
whether they are led by government or NGOs, ranging between 0.1 percent and
5 percent of total costs. Information on M&E costs for SSN programs is unavailable, as
the programs did not report those costs separately. Among L&J programs, the ­average
cost seems to be lower for government-led programs. This may be due to the less structured way M&E is likely undertaken in government programs, which might also be
why, primarily, government-led SSN programs do not report M&E separately. At the
same time, it might also reflect the stronger accountability systems that are normally in
place for NGO-led programs.

Assessing Cost Effectiveness and Exploring Cost
Optimization Strategies
The relationship between the magnitude of impact and cost is largely unclear. An interesting finding from Sulaiman (2018) is that higher program cost does not necessarily
translate to higher impacts (measured by increase in consumption), and, similarly, lower
program cost does not imply lower impacts. As explained earlier, this may be because
the measured impacts are an underestimation of true impacts. For example, there may
be primary outcomes (such as income or assets ownership), but there may also be local
spillovers that are of interest but that are not incorporated in or represented by consumption increases. Nevertheless, the fact that greater expenditure does not necessarily result
in greater impact also highlights the scope for improving effectiveness at any level of cost.
The rate of return on economic inclusion programs is quite varied and sensitive
to impact dissipation rates. According to Bandiera et al. (2017), the rate of return for
BRAC’s TUP program is 16 percent per year, whereas Afghanistan’s TUP program and
Uganda’s Women’s Income-Generating Support (WINGS) program show an average
return to investment of 26 percent (Bedoya et al. 2019) and 24 percent (Blattman et al.
2016), respectively. Blattman, Dercon, and Franklin (2019) evaluate a start-up grantand-training program and an industrial job placement program in Ethiopia and find
minimal returns—not enough to cover the cost of the programs.
While differing elements of intervention design could lead to these different
outcomes, it is interesting to note that a similar variance is observed even for the same
intervention when it is implemented in different contexts. Banerjee et al. (2015) evaluate a six-country pilot of the CGAP–Ford Foundation graduation program and find
rates of return (per year) between 7 percent in Ghana and 23 percent in India, with
an average of 12 percent (not including negative benefits in Honduras). Their analysis
of cost-effectiveness is among the most robust among all impact studies of economic
inclusion programs and the analysis reports on annual impact dissipation rate. They
find that at annual rates of dissipation of the impact size, 1.8 percent in Ghana,
2.6 percent in Peru, 5 percent in Pakistan, 10 percent in Ethiopia, and 31 percent in
India, the benefits and cost of the programs are equalized. In other words, largely
moderate dissipation of impacts can nullify the investment case for such programs.
For governments to scale up economic inclusion programming, an important
consideration is how to sustain impact at lower cost. For large-scale programs, especially when led by government, there are trade-offs with respect to adequacy and
customization versus cost and complexity. At the same time, not all groups face the
same constraints or need the same level of support; customizing the program for different groups may be more cost-effective than implementing a standardized package.
Box 6.3 summarizes some recent innovations to optimize on costs, without diluting
impact, that could inform the design of large-scale government-led programs.

BOX 6.3 Innovative Mechanisms to Optimize on Costs
Variations in size and cost recovery of the cash grant. In Bangladesh, BRAC modified
the Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction: Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP)
program, varying the nature of the asset transfer (grant versus loan) and the provision of
a cash transfer for consumption support for different segments in the ultrapoor population. Both variants increased assets, income, self-employment, consumption, and diet
diversity, and although the least intensive variant had lower impact, it also cost much
less (Das et al. 2016). In West Bengal, however, a similar pilot (varying grant versus
credit by segments of the ultrapoor population) was discontinued due to practical challenges with loan repayment after program exit (Sheldon 2016). In Sri Lanka, the largescale program Samurdhi transitioned in 2014 from grants to a mix of grant and credit
for all participants, with variations depending on vulnerability and repayment capacity
(Tilakaratna and Sooriyamudali 2016).
Variations in intensity of modality, frequency, and content of training and coaching.
In Burundi, the Terintambwe Program divided its beneficiaries into two experimental
groups—a “high treatment” group and a “low treatment” group, with some participants
receiving more intensive support from case managers than others, who received fewer
visits. An evaluation found that program impact did not significantly vary between highand low-intensity participants (Devereux et al. 2015). In Uganda, the Women’s IncomeGenerating Support (WINGS) program varied the frequency and, thereby, the content
of its most expensive program component (which cost two to three times the grant
amount), supervision or coaching. The first two visits focused on holding beneficiaries
accountable to their business plans, and later visits provided advice. Results of an evaluation show that two visits were as good as five visits in improving the business survival
rate, even as supervision by itself did not improve income and food security.
Shifting from individual to group-based interventions. Shifting from individual to
group focus can reduce administrative costs and the monitoring burden. The Uganda
Village Enterprise program managed to reduce its costs by a third compared to the
six-­country study of the CGAP–Ford Foundation pilots by Banerjee et al. (2015) using
group-based training and keeping the intervention to a shorter duration (Sedlmayr,
Shah, and Sulaiman 2019). Despite the low cost, it achieved impact in terms of increases
in self-employment activities, improved assets, higher subjective well-being, and higher
consumption. In Kenya, The BOMA Project’s group-based Rural Entrepreneur Access
Program (REAP) had similar positive impacts.
Entrepreneurial group formation. Group formation can also amplify outcomes and
serve as a tool for sustainability, by promoting social networks and group-based
­production and marketing. In Uganda, the Youth Opportunities Program (YOP)
supported group-based microenterprises rather than individual businesses. Operating
in groups allowed participants to negotiate discounts from trainers (Blattman, Fiala,
and Martinez 2014). Another program in Uganda, WINGS, which supported individual
microentrepreneurs, enabled half of them to form self-help groups. While group formation did not necessarily increase the size, survival, or profitability of the businesses of
the individual participants, it doubled their earnings relative to those of participants
who were not in the groups, mainly by increasing cooperation in the form of labor sharing, cooperative cash cropping, and informal finance. It also mitigated resentment and
abuse that participants faced from nonparticipating households in the neighborhood

Innovative Mechanisms to Optimize on Costs (continued)

(Blattman et al. 2016). Such group formation, typically for savings but also for joint
market-related activities, is a core feature of many livelihood programs, including India’s
National Rural Livelihood Mission and JEEViKA, as discussed in case study 2.
Deepening financial inclusion through digital finance and mobile money. By
making digital payments of grants, some economic inclusion programs can connect
some of the poorest households to the financial system. The payment service providers benefit as well, as they can access a large pool of unbanked households, thereby
increasing their customer base. Through innovative products such as microloans,
payment service providers can continue to engage some of these households, either
individually or even as groups. In making microloans, digital transaction history
could also provide some markers of the quality of lending. At the same time, delivery systems need to be careful about not excluding those who are unable to access
digital platforms. In Kenya, REAP used a digital finance platform to promote the use of
various financial instruments for savings, loans, and payments. However, low literacy
and numeracy levels, lack of familiarity with mobile technology, and preferences for
savings in cash and livestock limited participants’ usage of digital financial products
(Tiwari, Schaub, and Sultana 2019).

More research is needed to answer these questions fully. Fortunately, there is a rich
pipeline of program-specific research (see appendix B for the thematic research planned
by the programs in the Partnership for Economic Inclusion (PEI) Landscape Survey
2020) as well as multicountry research agendas on SSN programming (World Bank
2019) and complementary programming involving SSN together with agricultural and
other livelihood programs (Maldonado et al. 2016; FAO 2018).

Future Directions
This chapter deliberately moves away from pursuing a “sticker price” costing approach
and to that of “costing to design and context.” This is driven by the realities of the
economic inclusion programming landscape reflected in chapter 3 and is well founded
in the observed variation in cost per beneficiary from existing impact evaluation literature as well as the PEI Quick Costing Tool 2020.
The chapter also pivots toward the broader and more timely use of costing data for
programming and policy making. Costing data, particularly disaggregated data, can be
highly informative to the process of designing programs (including assessing affordability and potential scale, and the extent to which beneficiaries’ multiple constraints are
addressed) and to the monitoring of expenditures for the purpose of identifying bottlenecks to implementation.
Going forward, it is critical that economic inclusion program implementers, both
government and nongovernment, and policy makers innovatively use and make available costing data. The analysis in this chapter is based on a small subset of economic
inclusion programs, but as reflected in chapter 3, there are at least 219 programs
currently being implemented globally. Increasing the number of programs reporting

172

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

cost information would allow for better and more robust analysis, particularly by
program types, regions, target groups, and so forth. Besides any follow-up data collection exercises by researchers or practitioners, a data dashboard has been developed by
the Partnership for Economic Inclusion and is one avenue through which cost data can
be reported and analyzed (https://www.peiglobal.org/pei-data-portal).
At the same time, it is important that researchers assessing the impact of economic
inclusion programs systematically collect and report on cost data in addition to impact
sizes. Besides programmatic data, impact literature is another source of costing data
and is significant when it comes to estimating cost-effectiveness. Here again, the costing template developed as part of this chapter’s rapid survey could be a starting point
for further revision and use. Often impact literature does not report disaggregated cost
data but, as shown earlier, this can be quite operationally relevant—after all, impact
assessments are often undertaken to make a case for further investments and scale up
of programs.
It would also be useful to further refine and develop the PEI Quick Costing Tool
2020 to improve its relevance to endogenous and exogenous programmatic evolution.
There are a couple of reasons. First, as highlighted earlier, the costing tool has various
limitations given the rapid nature of the costing survey. These include the incorporation of beneficiary costs in terms of both direct and opportunity costs of participation
as well as parsing staff costs into their benefit delivery and administrative components.
Second, economic inclusion programs will likely evolve further over the next many
years to reflect the improved knowledge and learning on such programming, particularly in response to exogenous shocks, such as COVID-19. The PEI Quick Costing Tool
2020 would need to evolve to respond to these changing programmatic needs as well as
to mitigate many of the limitations identified.

Notes
1. It is important to note that the 2011 US$, PPP is used for cost comparison, because it is the
least common denominator across all projects surveyed.
2. In this chapter, “NGO-led” is used, as only governments and nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) submitted costing data.
3. Note that here we do not divide the total cost by duration of each program. Although dividing
by duration would help standardize the comparison across programs, it is misleading, as
duration of economic inclusion packages is an important aspect of the program’s design.
Those that are designed such that their beneficiaries receive a set of interventions over a
longer duration of time (perhaps because they are slow climbers or highly vulnerable) will
likely cost more than those that are of shorter duration. In discussing adequacy of benefits,
however, we standardize by duration.
4. The Youth Support Program, which has different grant sizes and components.
5. The only exception is the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan, which
provides its training at two separate times and consists of training in rearing and keeping
assets, encouragement of personal and group savings, and basic financial literacy.

CASE STUDY 1

Productive Inclusion Measures and
Adaptive Social Protection in the
Sahel
Introduction
Against the backdrop of recurring climate shocks and deep poverty, governments
in Africa’s Sahel region have introduced economic inclusion programs for national
­beneficiaries of social safety nets (SSNs). Over the last decade, the governments of
Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal have established national
SSN programs that provide regular and predictable cash transfers to poor and vulnerable households, focusing strongly on women as the primary recipients of the transfers.
The programs help to address chronic poverty and acute food insecurity.
Many households also face constraints to improving their incomes, ­productivity,
and resilience. To address these constraints, countries expanded their SSN systems
and complemented cash transfer programs with productive measures. These efforts
have been implemented by national government institutions, with support from the
World Bank and its development partners through the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection
Program (SASPP)—see box CS1.1 and World Bank (2017).
This case study describes the implementation of a coherent set of productive
inclusion measures through national SSN programs in four Sahel countries: Burkina
Faso, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal.1 It also provides insights into the challenges and
opportunities of delivering productive inclusion programs at scale through government
systems. Preliminary operational insights are already emerging, including the importance of government leadership and institutional coordination; the value of broader
investments in the SSN system; and the need for flexibility in delivery arrangements,
depending on the country context.

BOX CS1.1 The Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program Funding
The Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program (SASPP) is supported by a multidonor
trust fund (MDTF) managed by the World Bank. The United Kingdom’s Department
for International Development (DFID) provided an initial contribution to the MDTF
of £46 million ($63 million) over five years (2014–19). Since then, new donors have
joined the MDTF. Agence Française de Développement (AFD) contributed approximately $7 million in 2018, and a philanthropic foundation provided $1.35 million to
support the multicountry impact evaluation of productive inclusion measures and a
further $1.35 million to support program implementation in Burkina Faso. Germany’s
Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) recently committed
€50 million, which will enable SASPP to continue until at least 2025.

This case study was written by Edward Archibald (independent consultant), Thomas Bossuroy (World Bank
Group, WBG), and Patrick Premand (WBG).

The robust evidence base being built will inform a potential scale-up of productive
measures in the region and beyond. The productive measures are being tested through
a multicountry impact evaluation led by a team of researchers from the World Bank and
several universities in partnership with Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), a research
and policy organization. The evaluation will be complemented by operational learning
and process evaluations. Its findings will be disseminated in 2020–21, benefiting future
discussions of an expansion within the region.
The operational lessons offered in this case study are intended to support other
governments that may consider delivering productive measures for poor and vulnerable
households through the platform of a national SSN program.

Context
The Sahel is home to some of the poorest countries in the world. Although poverty
rates have fallen in recent decades, the levels of poverty across the region remain high.2
Measured by the international poverty line of $1.90 a day, the poverty headcount ratios
in the Sahel (latest year) are 49.7 percent in Niger, 49.3 percent in Mali, 43.7 percent
in Burkina Faso, 38.4 percent in Chad, and 38.0 in Senegal. Although the ratio is low
in Mauritania at 6.0 percent, this rate increases to 33.0 percent when measured by the
national poverty line. When the international poverty line of $3.20 a day is applied—a
proxy for vulnerability to poverty—these rates increase markedly to about 66 percent
for all countries except Mauritania (World Bank 2018b). The Sahel region is also
increasingly exposed to conflict and insecurity, contributing since 2011 to an increase
in the number of refugees, internally displaced persons, asylum seekers, and stateless
persons (World Bank 2018b, 2019a, 2019b).
In the Sahel, the incidence of poverty is higher in rural areas, where inhabitants
largely depend on agriculture. Urban poverty rates are more than 30 percentage points
lower than rural rates, with the exception of Senegal. Large proportions of people
move in and out of poverty as well. For example, between 2006 and 2011, 45 percent
of poor households in Senegal escaped poverty, but during the same period 40 percent
of nonpoor households fell into it, leaving the poverty rate almost unchanged
(World Bank 2018b).
The risks posed by climate change loom large in the Sahel. Large covariate shocks
such as drought regularly affect the region, and the number of persons affected by
drought has been increasing in recent decades. This trend is expected to continue
because of climate change (World Bank 2018b). Although climate models on future
rainfall patterns in the Sahel show considerable divergence in predictions (Park, Bader,
and Matei 2015), it is generally accepted that rainfall has been more erratic in the
region (Bolwig et al. 2011), which is expected to induce additional flooding, drought,
pests, and temperature shocks (World Bank 2018b).
Climatic shocks have a strong tendency to disproportionately affect the poorest and
most vulnerable, underscoring the need to diversify livelihoods and strengthen resilience. Agriculture is the dominant sector for employment in the Sahel, and more than
80 percent of all employment is vulnerable—such as self-employed workers or those
helping in household enterprises. Many households also have limited savings, assets,
and access to the finance that could help them manage the impacts of climatic shocks.
For example, households in Senegal affected by a natural disaster between 2011 and 2016
were 9 percentage points more likely than other households to fall into extreme poverty
(Dang, Lanjouw, and Swinkels 2014). Many households are ill-equipped to face seasonal
lean periods and shocks, experiencing both acute and chronic periods of food insecurity
(World Bank 2018b). Poor households often rely on coping mechanisms that will eventually have negative consequences on their human capital or earnings, such as taking out
179

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

high-interest loans, reducing consumption, withdrawing children from school, or selling
household and productive assets (sometimes at highly reduced prices).
Populations are growing across the region, and yet the human development
­indicators remain poor. Most Sahel countries expect a doubling of their current
­population before 2050. Niger recorded the highest annual population growth rate,
4 percent, in the region over the 2010–15 period, and its population is expected to
increase threefold by 2050. All countries in the region rank low on the World Bank’s
Human Capital Index, with future generations estimated to fulfill only between 30
percent (Chad) and 42 percent (Senegal) of their economic potential when they
reach adulthood. The index is particularly influenced by the low levels of educational
­attainment. Although economic inclusion programs have the potential to support
households facing poverty and multiple interrelated challenges, the programs also need
to be tailored to the characteristics and constraints faced by this population.
Gender empowerment is an urgent priority in the Sahel, with women having low
levels of education and employment. Access to basic education remains a challenge in the
region, particularly for girls, which has implications for future income (see box CS1.2).
Between 2011 and 2014, net school attendance for girls was approximately 50 percent in
Chad, Mali, and Niger (OECD 2020). Persistent barriers to girls’ education include early
marriage and early motherhood and a division of household labor by gender. Girls suffer
from low literacy rates such as just 15 percent in Niger and 34 percent in Mali (OECD
2020), which affect their ability to engage in productive employment. Women’s labor
participation rates are lower than men’s, with a gap of 49 percentage points in Niger.

The rise and the potential of safety nets
In recent years, governments across the region have made significant investments in
creating national social protection systems and programs that provide regular cash
transfers to poor and vulnerable households. Social protection interventions in the
Sahel have generally focused on providing direct emergency responses to drought,
food prices, or other seasonal shocks. Over the past decade, however, governments
have begun to set up more permanent national social protection systems, ­including
implementing regular cash transfers to poor and vulnerable households. SSN
programs now cover more than 4.5 million beneficiaries in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal, and most of the cash transfer recipients are women.
These programs generally identify and enroll beneficiaries through a combination of
geographic and household targeting, using either community-based targeting or proxy
means testing. The transfers aim to provide consumption support and reduce food insecurity, as well as facilitate investments in children’s human capital and in livelihoods.

 irls in Burkina Faso: Less Likely to Attend School, with Implications for
Future Income
Almost half of primary school–age children in Burkina Faso are not enrolled in school,
and girls are one of the groups at the highest risk of nonattendance. The gender gap in
attendance is already notable at the primary school level, with a difference of 4 percentage points between boys and girls (World Bank 2019c). Girls not finishing primary
school are more likely to earn income from agriculture, a sector with low average
­productivity. Completion of primary school reduces the chances of staying in agriculture
by 23 percentage points (World Bank 2019c).

They are provided for two to three years in Burkina Faso, Chad, and Niger and up to
five years in Mauritania and Senegal (World Bank 2019a).
The maturity of SSN systems varies across the Sahel region. Government-led SSN
systems in Chad and Mauritania are somewhat nascent and have focused on establishing the foundations of a system, accompanied by a phased expansion of cash transfers to beneficiaries. By contrast, countries such as Niger and Senegal are substantially
more advanced, having well established delivery platforms and national programs with
coverage of almost 3.5 million individuals between them.
With their growing coverage and efforts to set up delivery systems to reach and
serve the poor, SSN systems provide a platform for delivering productive inclusion
measures efficiently at scale.

Identifying constraints to productivity and resilience:
The diagnostic phase
Productive inclusion measures are intended to tackle the key binding constraints faced by
the poor. Identifying those constraints accurately is a necessary first step toward designing effective economic inclusion programs. Prior to designing productive measures for
the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program, the World Bank and partner governments
undertook a range of qualitative and quantitative assessments to identify and prioritize
the main constraints faced by SSN beneficiaries in their income-­generating activities.
A quantitative constraint analysis was undertaken by IPA, and qualitative research was
carried out by international and local researchers. The qualitative studies highlighted
some of the main constraints faced by poor households in the Sahel:
••
••
••
••
••
••

Access to capital
Technical and business skills
Access to markets (for inputs and outputs)
Social norms, particularly affecting women and the socially disadvantaged
Psychosocial and aspirational constraints
Capacity to manage risk (Bossuroy, Kossoubé, and Premand 2017)

The quantitative and qualitative diagnoses were complemented by a literature review of
local and international experiences. Consultations were also organized in each country
with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), civil society organizations, and government partners.
The diagnostic studies and consultations suggested that these multiple constraints
be addressed through a set of interventions that does the following:
•• Reduces the poorest households’ exposure to risk and vulnerability
•• Facilitates diversification of their income-generating activities
•• Improves their capacity to plan their finances and manage risk in the short to
medium term
•• Develops their skills
•• Enables them to acquire and accumulate productive assets
•• Builds an enabling environment in which women are supported and empowered to
take new initiatives

Designing the content of productive measures
A joint design process was set up across the six Sahel countries with SSN programs—
Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. That process led to
181

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

consensus on a package of productive measures. A regional workshop was convened
by the World Bank in 2016 with participation by the governments of the six c­ ountries,
NGOs, development partners, and researchers. The objective was to take stock of the
­diagnostic studies and decide on packages of productive measures that could be implemented and tested across participating countries, with technical support from a regional
­activity led by the World Bank and its technical partners. The results of the diagnoses
and consultations on local experiences were combined with evidence about the most
­promising interventions gleaned from the international literature.

BOX CS1.3 Overview of Productive Inclusion Measures in the Sahel
Component 1: Group formation and coaching
Coaches facilitate program activities (such as mobilization of beneficiaries for meetings and
coordination with service providers) for groups of 15–25 individual beneficiaries. They also
provide individual and group coaching. They meet with beneficiary groups on a regular basis
and organize follow-up visits with individuals every few months. Sessions are intended to
identify and resolve the constraints facing beneficiaries.
Component 2: Community sensitization on aspirations and social norms
This measure seeks to address the aspirational or psychosocial constraints facing many individuals, particularly women, in undertaking new initiatives and income-­generating activities.
A short video is shown to all community members, telling the story of poor, food-insecure
individuals who overcome many barriers and successfully engage in productive investments.
After the video, a group discussion is facilitated on themes such as aspirations, social dynamics, and women’s empowerment.a
Component 3: Facilitation of savings groups for beneficiaries
Using the village savings and loan association model, coaches help beneficiaries form community savings groups and provide ongoing technical support to help manage the groups.
Component 4: Life skills training
To further help address the psychosocial barriers faced by beneficiaries, a week-long, groupbased training session covers topics such as self-esteem, personal initiative, aspirations,
social norms, and spousal, gender, and generational roles.
Component 5: Microentrepreneurship training
This week-long, group-based training covers basic business skills. It focuses on cross-cutting
microentrepreneurship skills, including basic accounting and management principles, market
research, planning and scheduling, saving, and investing. The training also covers the risks
and opportunities of income-generating activities that beneficiaries are interested in initiating
or expanding.
Component 6: One-time lump sum cash grant
After savings groups are formed and have received training, beneficiaries work with coaches
to develop a business plan that outlines how they will invest funds in agricultural or nonagricultural activities. Beneficiaries are then given an unconditional lump sum cash grant of $140–$275
(the amount varies across countries, according to income level and available budget).
Component 7: Facilitation of access to inputs and markets
Coaches help to locate suppliers for inputs for beneficiaries’ investments (such as seeds for
agricultural initiatives) and facilitate group purchases to help reduce unit costs. Although this
is a separate component, in practice it is integrated with coaching.

Characteristics of the Village Savings and Loan Association Model

As part of the productive package, the measure on village saving and loan associations
(VSLAs) seeks to address constraints to financial inclusion. Financial institutions have a
limited reach in the Sahel. In Niger, for example, less than 4 percent of adults have a bank
account and less than 2 percent borrow from a financial institution, including 1 percent
of women (World Bank 2018a, 3). Mutual savings associations (tontines) are widespread
across the region, but they generally do not replace the need for informal networks and
family ties to access credit. The VSLA instrument is a more structured saving instrument
that includes a credit facility. The model has a range of key characteristics.
Affinity and ownership. Members know each other and come from similar economic
backgrounds with common interests. All rules applicable to the VSLA are decided
by the group for each cycle: cost of the share, interest rate, penalty fees, solidarity
­contribution, and loan maturity. Rules can be voted on, but consensus is the norm.
Accountability. All financial transactions (savings and loans) are conducted during a full
meeting of the VSLA to ensure transparency and accountability.
Purchase of shares. Savings are generated when members purchase shares in the
VSLA. The value of one share, agreed on by the group, can vary over time, depending
on the members’ saving capacity. Members have the option to purchase between one
and five shares per VSLA meeting.
Loans. Each member is allowed to take a monthly loan, and repayment is spread over
three months with an interest rate agreed on by the group—generally 5–10 percent.
Members are not allowed to accumulate loans. The fund for loans is the total of the
shares currently owned by members, the interest generated by previously repaid loans,
and payments for penalties.
Solidarity. Members contribute not only to their savings, but also to a separate fund to
support members in need, which is distributed based on a group consensus.
Autonomy. Members control the group’s resources and rules—not external actors or
nongovernmental organizations, which may be engaged to provide support.

The productive measures were defined to address coherently the identified
constraints. For selected cash transfer beneficiaries, the regular cash transfers would
be complemented by a package of time-bound productive measures consisting of
seven components: (1) individual and group coaching; (2) community sensitization on
­aspirations and social norms; (3) village savings and loan associations (VSLAs); (4) life
skills training; (5) microentrepreneurship training; (6) a lump sum cash grant; and
(7) facilitation of access to inputs and markets. These components are described in more
detail in box CS1.3, and the VSLA measure is described in more detail in box CS1.4.
Four countries—Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal—elected to
­implement the productive package that came out of the design process. Chad and Mali
implemented productive measures inspired by the diagnostic and consultation phases
but with some variations in content.
183

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

The productive measures were offered to the beneficiaries of national SSN
programs, the overwhelming majority of whom are women. The diagnostics phase
influenced the decision by all countries to give priority to female participants because
empowerment of women was identified as a critical pathway to greater economic
resilience. In some countries, the beneficiary of the productive package was the recipient of cash transfers regardless of the age of the beneficiary, while in other countries
steps were taken to ensure that younger women in the household also benefited from
productive measures. For example, in Niger the individual recipient of the productive measures was the cash transfer recipient. In Burkina Faso, every adult woman in
selected households received regular cash transfers. Every adult woman also benefited
from the productive measures, but the lump sum cash grant was given to the youngest adult. In Senegal, the government took steps to give priority to the participation of
young women in the household, even when a young woman was not the primary cash
transfer beneficiary. In Mauritania, the individual recipient of the productive measures
was the cash transfer recipient or a young woman in the household.
The measures are implemented in rural areas in all countries except Senegal,
which opted to implement the program in urban and peri-urban areas. The factors
­affecting Senegal’s decision included rising urbanization rates and a predominantly
young ­population that faces limited opportunities for participation in the formal labor
market. High job insecurity and labor informality, especially among the poor, youth,
and women, are a major policy challenge for the Senegalese government. The government identified the urban and peri-urban areas of Dakar, along with two regional
­capitals (Kaolack and Thies), with suburbs selected according to the criteria of poverty,
­urbanization, and unemployment among young people and women.
More than 50,000 households across the four participating countries have received
the package of productive measures, as shown in table CS1.1. The average duration
of a productive inclusion measure in each country is 12–18 months. As of early 2020,
implementation had been completed in Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal, and it was
nearing completion in Burkina Faso.

Modalities for delivering productive measures
The productive measures are delivered through national SSN programs, which are
­operated by government institutions. The government agency in each country responsible for overseeing SSNs is also responsible for the accompanying productive measures,
which includes planning, budgeting, monitoring, coordinating, and procuring e­ xternal

service providers (such as trainers or payment providers for the lump sum transfer).3
The SSN agencies have both central-level staff and decentralized staff throughout
the country. To accommodate the scale of additional activities, each SSN agency has
appointed staff to act as a national focal point for the productive measures and has
identified field staff to supervise implementation.
Although the content of the productive measures package is similar across
­countries, delivery modalities vary across countries. Each national SSN agency tailored
its approach to implementation to accommodate its institutional context, delivery
systems, scale of operation, and local realities.
In Niger, a combination of SSN agency staff, service providers, and community coaches
implemented the productive measures package. As shown in figure CS1.1, beneficiaries
elect a member of their community as a coach, and coaches are then trained by field operators from the SSN agency. Once fully trained, the elected coaches facilitate the savings
groups and advise beneficiaries on their investments. Field ­operators supervise overall
implementation on behalf of the SSN agency, with one field ­operator allocated to oversee
multiple villages (nine on average). The SSN agency contracts firms to train beneficiaries
on life skills and microentrepreneurship. The lump sum cash transfer is effectively a vertical scale-up of the transfer provided by the SSN program—that is, it is provided through a
payment agency, using the same delivery mechanism as for the national SSN program.
A second delivery modality involves contracts and partnerships between SSN a­ gencies,
training firms, and NGOs (see figure CS1.2). In two provinces of Burkina Faso and Senegal,
NGOs provided community volunteer coaches with training and ongoing supervision and
support. SSN agency teams supervised implementation by training the NGOs and monitoring their work based on clearly established implementation manuals and field protocols.
Finally, in two provinces of Burkina Faso and in Mauritania NGOs delivered the full
package, except for the cash grants, which were paid through the national SSN system. In
Mauritania, the NGOs involved are regular government partners in charge of d
­ elivering
human capital measures in the SSN program, and they extended their role to include

productive measures. In Burkina Faso, NGOs were selected to implement only the productive measures and worked with independent funding mobilized by Trickle Up, a nonprofit
international development organization, in partnership with the SSN agency.
The capacity of national SSN agencies to deliver the productive measures was
enhanced through technical assistance from external partners. The Sahel Adaptive
Social Protection Program facilitated technical assistance at the regional level to support
content development for implementation manuals and curricula, as well as training
of trainers in each country. This assistance included partnerships with Trickle Up for
village savings and loan associations and coaching and with the Centre de Suivi et
­d’Assistance et de Management (CESAM) for training (see box CS1.5). Similarly, the
script and production of video-based community sensitization were carried out in partnership with local communications experts, videographers, and a social psychologist.
These collaborations were established at the regional level for various reasons.
First, there were economies of scope because of the similarity of the package implemented in different countries stemming from the cross-cutting nature of the underlying
constraints to income-generating activities. Second, collaboration led to cost savings in
developing a common set of high-quality materials. And, third, national SSN agencies
that had not yet implemented integrated packages of productive measures had capacity constraints in these areas. In addition to regional support, each national SSN agency
adapted the core set of operational tools to suit the local needs and context. The technical assistance provided at the regional level complemented the regular supervision and
support provided by the World Bank’s country teams.

Cost of productive measures
A thorough costing exercise was undertaken consistently across the four participating
countries. The Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program developed a rigorous costing

P
Trickle Up is an international nongovernmental organization with extensive experience
worldwide in productive inclusion. Trickle Up supported the design of implementation manuals and the training of trainers for two components of the package: coaching and savings groups. This work built on earlier smaller-scale experimentation by
Trickle Up in the Sahel. The design of the operational manuals for the Sahel Adaptive
Social Protection Program recognized two key factors: (1) the context of extremely poor
women in the Sahel and the external and internal constraints they face; and (2) delivery of the package through national social protection programs instead of outside
government systems. In addition to developing the operational manuals for national
social safety net (SSN) agencies, Trickle Up provided program implementers across five
countries with training of trainers on coaching and village saving and loan associations.
Training sessions a few months apart were complemented by field visits to provide
implementing agencies and field staff with feedback.
Trickle Up also mobilized funding to implement the productive package in two
­provinces in Burkina Faso, working in close collaboration with the national SSN agency
and the World Bank.
Partnership with Centre de Suivi et d’Assistance et de Management
The Partnership with Centre de Suivi et d’Assistance et de Management (CESAM), a
training firm based in Benin, supports the development and rollout of t­ raining programs
across Africa for the International Labour Organization (ILO). CESAM supported the
design and adaptation of materials for the behavioral skills and microentrepreneurship
training. Based on this content, CESAM then trained trainers in partnership with master
trainers in each country. CESAM also developed the training materials for facilitation of
access to inputs and markets. These materials were used to train and support coaches
to serve as intermediaries and social entrepreneurs to link the beneficiaries with input
suppliers for both agricultural and nonagricultural livelihoods.

template to clearly break out costs for each specific intervention and costs related to
program administration. For each component, the key cost items such as t­ransport,
equipment, materials, housing, and restoration were listed and reviewed by the program
teams and SSN agencies. Management and supervision costs were factored in, including
the time costs of all staff involved in the country program (from government, NGO partners, or the World Bank). This approach allowed precise estimation of the cost of each
intervention and separate reporting of specific administrative or nonintervention costs.

Supporting implementation at scale through
monitoring and evaluation and regional learning
Although there are differences across the six countries, national SSN agencies tackle
many of the same issues in the design and implementation of productive measures.
Thus innovations in one country can be pertinent to all. A regional learning agenda
was outlined to gather lessons from the implementation of the productive measures
187

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

and learn about their effectiveness collaboratively. This coordinated learning effort
included a multicountry impact evaluation, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) data,
and process evaluations.

Multicountry impact evaluation
A multicountry impact evaluation is assessing the impact and cost-effectiveness of the
productive measures in Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. The evaluation is
addressing a range of priority policy questions such as: What is the impact of a comprehensive package of productive accompanying measures on cash transfer beneficiaries?
How can the package be optimized and made more cost-effective? How can one ensure
that the package is inclusive and has an impact on the extreme poor? The evaluation
is led by a team of researchers at the World Bank in partnership with researchers in
several universities and IPA.
The impact evaluation is designed as a randomized controlled trial in which 16,700
beneficiaries from SSN programs in Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal were
randomized into four groups. All groups receive regular cash transfers through the national
SSN program, with variation in the allocation of the accompanying measures as follows:
•• Control group. This group receives only regular cash transfers with no productive
package.
•• Treatment group 1 (Full Package). This group receives regular cash transfers and the
full package of accompanying measures described in table CS1.2.
•• Treatment group 2 (Capital Package). This group receives regular cash transfers and
a capital-centric package, which includes coaching, village savings groups, entrepreneurship training, and a lump sum cash grant. Participating households in this group
do not receive sensitization on aspirations and social norms or life skills t­raining.
(By testing the program with and without these psychosocial interventions, the evaluation will be able to determine whether addressing participants’ aspirations and
social norms improves the program’s overall effectiveness.)
•• Treatment group 3 (Social Package). This group receives regular cash transfers and
a package of productive measures with a stronger focus on addressing ­psychosocial
constraints, including coaching, village savings groups, community sensitization
on aspirations and social norms, life skills training, and entrepreneurship ­training.

Participating households in this group do not receive the lump sum cash grant.
(Because the lump sum cash grant is one of the most expensive components of
the package, researchers and policy makers are interested in identifying the cost-­
effectiveness of the transfer itself.)
The impact evaluation will analyze a broad range of outcomes related to economic
welfare (consumption, food security, resilience), participation and earnings in
income-generating activities (nonagricultural activities, livestock, agriculture, wage
work, diversification), as well as psychosocial well-being. Nearly 95 percent of beneficiaries are women, and the impact evaluation will pay special attention to gender
empowerment, including by measuring women’s engagement in income-generating
activities, control over resources, participation in decision-making, agency, relationships with partners, and, more generally, gender attitudes.

M&E data and process evaluation
The capacity of government institutions to implement at scale has been supported by
strong monitoring and evaluation. An M&E module was developed specifically for the
productive measures, tracking delivery of the package consistently across countries.
The M&E module was linked to SSN program management information systems as
much as possible. The data were collected through a decentralized approach, with each
country developing its own protocols. Technical support was provided by a regional
team to build synergies and ensure a coordinated approach.
To complement M&E data, process evaluations have been commissioned in Burkina
Faso, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal, looking in depth at the complex issue of implementing coaching at scale within a government program. Complementary efforts
are also under way to summarize operational learning on how to design and implement productive inclusion packages through large-scale, government-led programs.
Consultations with various stakeholders (such as governments, World Bank staff, and
service providers) will influence the consolidation of implementation lessons.

Perspectives for scaling up
In 2020–21, results from the first phase of the impact evaluation, process evaluations,
and operational learning will be disseminated. Over the medium term, the evidence
base will inform the design and implementation of the programs evaluated, and it may
affect the design and implementation of other programs across the region.
The emerging evidence base has already had an influence on recent initiatives in
the Sahel. In Niger, for example, the operational learning has shaped the productive
inclusion components of a youth employment project and an operation to support
refugees and host communities.4 The second phase of Niger’s Adaptive Safety Net
Project also includes a component on productive inclusion, with implementation
modalities adjusted according to the results of the impact evaluation. Similarly, the
SSN program in Senegal has planned a large scale-up of the productive measures in
response to needs arising from the COVID-19 crisis. Meanwhile, the governments of
Mauritania and Senegal are discussing the implementation of productive measures
as an exit strategy for cash transfer beneficiaries. A new SSN program in Mauritania
has incorporated a productive inclusion component for households exiting the
national conditional cash transfer program.5 Youth employment programs in Burkina
Faso and Mauritania will include productive measures based on lessons learned from
the first phase of implementation.
189

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

Lessons
Detailed findings from the impact evaluations and operational learning will be disseminated to governments and other stakeholders in 2020–21. Pending publication of these
findings, this section outlines some emerging operational lessons at the institutional
and programmatic levels on working at scale.

Institutional and delivery modality lessons
The diagnostic phase was critical to grounding the program design in evidence, but also
to creating a consensus around program objectives and facilitating government leadership. The evidence collected through qualitative and quantitative surveys created
unique opportunities to look more closely at the daunting challenge of increasing the
productivity of poor households and women in particular, to discuss the concrete
constraints they face when engaging in economic activities, and to create consensus
across various agencies around the objectives of the productive measures.
Government-led national SSN programs offer a platform for implementing productive inclusion measures at scale. National social protection systems were established
in the region to support the basic needs of poor and vulnerable households. Although
cash transfer programs have had widely documented impacts, they also provide a platform to tackle constraints to economic activities through a combination of cash transfers and direct efforts to promote productive employment. A defining feature of the
Sahelian approach to productive inclusion is that national governments successfully led
overall implementation. National programs have defined and maintained a coordinated
approach, reducing fragmentation of interventions and opening a pathway to scale.
This approach has also allowed the delivery of productive measures at relatively low
cost. In a context in which there is a need to improve opportunities for the economic
empowerment of women, the productive measures provide new opportunities, particularly for younger women.
A multifaceted program requires pragmatic delivery arrangements and solid government coordination. Adaptations at scale require the articulation of delivery arrangements by SSN agencies and the creation of partnerships or sustained contractual
relationships with local organizations. Depending on the extent and nature of the existing field activities and on the skills available locally, governments may choose various
combinations of actors to deliver the set of productive measures. It is, however, critical that the package of activities be kept coherent, with consistent messages picked up
across the measures and coaching as a common thread.
Significant capacity is required at all levels of government (at both the central and
local levels) to oversee implementation and ensure close synergies with the relevant
programs and agencies.
Investment in delivery systems for national SSN programs lays the foundation for
the delivery and expansion of productive inclusion measures. The establishment of
national systems facilitates the layering of additional measures that advance economic
inclusion objectives and build resilience to shocks. For example, social registries include
a substantive cohort of poor and vulnerable households, and they can be used to
identify households that may benefit from productive measures; SSN agencies within
government can be supported to expand their coordination roles; and delivery mechanisms for SSNs provide an avenue for implementing complementary measures and
providing lump sum cash grants to beneficiaries.
Meanwhile, investing in high-quality monitoring data helps to improve the capacity of government agencies to track program implementation. The implementation of
190

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

complex interventions on a large scale by government systems must be accompanied
by comprehensive efforts to build strong M&E systems and integrate data collection
protocols in routine operations carried out by partner governments through their own
program management information systems.

Programmatic and operational lessons
Despite short time frames and seasonal challenges, the village savings and loan association
model has worked well, even in the most remote and deprived communities of the region.
Combining VSLAs with cash transfers can boost financial inclusion by directly allowing the
poor to participate. The flexibility of the VSLA approach, in which groups establish their
own rules, allows it to function in challenging times, such as the lean seasons when many
members are facing consumption pressures and are unable to save as much. The timeline
of activities needs to factor in the fact that VSLA groups need a few months to get up to
speed—that is, reach the point that members have a full understanding of the approach and
groups have sufficient resources to start the loan component.
The VSLA model is well placed to rapidly increase coverage through horizontal expansion. In Niger, the VSLA approach was easily embedded into the existing
beneficiary groups. As part of the SSN project in Niger, beneficiaries were organized
in groups, and these groups often organized rotating savings groups (ROSCAs, or
tontines). As part of the productive measures of the SASPP, groups of beneficiaries were
transformed into VSLAs, which facilitated mobilization and allowed VSLAs to quickly
get up and running. In other countries, groups had to be formed first, which took a
little more time.
Some savings groups are showing encouraging signs of sustainability, with the
prospect of links with formal financial institutions. Although support from the national
SSN program has concluded in Niger and Senegal, many savings groups continue to
operate. There may be scope for additional links between VSLAs and formal financial
institutions, such as opening a bank account for a VSLA and encouraging members to
open individual bank accounts.
As for the community coaches, it is not yet clear whether they can successfully
implement multiple layers of interventions. Community-level coaches have already
shown a degree of success, with preliminary findings suggesting some strong buy-in

Many coaches in Niger have low levels of education and so have at times struggled
to use formal coaching materials, even those with signs and pictures. Nonetheless,
coaches have gained the trust of beneficiaries. Payments for coaches by the project ended in early 2019, yet groups of beneficiaries in certain communes decided to
continue using their own funds to remunerate coaches for their work. These beneficiaries contribute a small amount each week—between $15 and $20 over the nine-month
period of the VSLA cycle. Coaches therefore remain active and continue providing
close support to beneficiaries. It appears that beneficiaries perceive that one of the
advantages offered by coaches is access to markets.

191

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

from communities, such as in Niger (see box CS1.6). But the efficiency of coaching large numbers of beneficiaries is not yet established, suggesting potential capacity constraints to expanding coverage through a horizontal scale-up. The profiles of
coaches vary widely, and still more must be learned about the optimal profile and what
types of technical support or incentives are most effective.
Women are empowered by participation in productive inclusion programs. Evidence
from process evaluations strongly suggests that, among other beneficial impacts,
women experience increased agency. Membership in VSLAs creates a safe space, which
fosters group dynamics and peer learning. Similarly, the psychosocial components help
to strengthen community support.
The community sensitization on social norms through the use of videos was
found to be very suitable for low-skilled individuals and for addressing gender norms.
Participation in the video session was high, and process evaluations showed that
­beneficiaries recalled key aspects of a storyline over a year after a video was projected.
Meanwhile, the larger community rallied around the objective of having women lead
economic initiatives and contribute to household income, creating a lasting enabling
environment for beneficiaries. This platform for delivering messages and triggering
social dynamics could be promising for other interventions targeting this population.
Urban and peri-urban environments present various implementation challenges.
The Senegal experience reveals that selecting areas for the program can be complex
and sensitive where there are few socioeconomic differences between neighborhoods.
Furthermore, beneficiaries frequently change residence in urban areas, presenting
complications for program implementers. And economic opportunities may reduce the
prospects for full attendance at training. There also may be limited locations for appropriate training sites in the neighborhoods where beneficiaries live, and coaches may
not live in proximity to all beneficiaries. Training tools also need to be adapted to urban
contexts, although the higher level of education among urban beneficiaries facilitates
participants’ comprehension of the training and related information.
The impact evaluation will address key policy questions identified by stakeholders
during the design phase. Until now, relatively little has been known about the impact
of different combinations of interventions, or about their effectiveness when implemented at scale in government-led national SSN programs. The systematic efforts to
both provide robust findings on the cost-effectiveness of various components and gain
a deeper understanding of the constraints and opportunities related to implementation
will inform future discussions of a broader rollout.

CASE STUDY 2

The State of Bihar’s Approach to
Economic Inclusion: JEEViKA and the
SJY Program
Introduction
In the eastern Indian state of Bihar, bordering Nepal, the Bihar Rural Livelihoods
Promotion Society (BRLPS), locally known as JEEViKA, is the state’s implementing
agency of the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM). JEEViKA has a statewide
mandate to mobilize rural women into a variety of community institutions, including
(1) affinity-based self-help groups; (2) village organizations (VOs) that are composed
of several of these self-help groups; (3) commodity-specific producer groups; and
(4) higher federations. These community institutions offer several advantages, as they
enable JEEViKA and others to offer capacity building to women collectively and allow
women to better access finance, public services, and direct links to markets.
Launched as a state-level partnership and World Bank–funded program, JEEViKA
has evolved into a multidimensional effort. It implements the NRLM and the World
Bank–funded Bihar Transformative Development Project (BTDP), and it is a platform
for targeted delivery of government policies and entitlement programs. Over 13 years of
operation, JEEViKA has leveraged its network of self-help groups to achieve the greater
financial and economic inclusion of more than 10 million poor rural women.
And yet despite strong economic inclusion programming and interventions shown
to increase incomes and assets, JEEViKA’s leadership realized that the poorest of the
state’s ­population faced challenges in engaging with its programs. JEEViKA’s core intervention relies on the self-selection of households into self-help groups and their participation in higher-order economic activities, but these activities were difficult to sustain
for the poorest and most vulnerable households.
In an attempt to address this challenge, JEEViKA embarked on a “graduation” pilot,
and shortly thereafter an ambitious scale-up, Satat Jeevikoparjan Yojana (SJY). This
case study primarily describes SJY, which is intended to serve the poorest people who
had been left out of JEEViKA’s broader programming. SJY is based on a contextualized
graduation approach that aims to integrate 100,000 of the poorest and most vulnerable of the state’s households into the VO infrastructure. Specifically, SJY seeks to boost
the human capital of the poorest and most excluded households through support of
consumption and livelihoods, savings, and training. This multidimensional support
is designed to develop the capacities of these households to take better advantage
of JEEViKA’s core programming and economic inclusion efforts, including access to
onward financing for enterprises, market links, food security interventions, and health
and sanitation services, among others.
Within JEEViKA’s broader economic inclusion programming, SJY is a ­graduation
approach with key adaptations and potentially salient lessons for other programs. It
explores new pathways for scale-up by leveraging JEEViKA’s community institutions

and financial inclusion infrastructure to implement the program and relies on
members of the community to serve as front-line implementers. As a livelihoods-plus
approach built on a platform of financial inclusion, JEEViKA tackles economic inclusion from a different entry point than that of social safety nets (SSNs) or cash-plus
approaches.

Context
Over the last three decades, India has made significant gains in economic growth and
poverty reduction. Alongside its growth, between 1994 and 2012 India halved the share
of its population in extreme poverty, bringing it down from 45 percent to 22 percent.
The pace of poverty reduction accelerated threefold from 2005 to 2012 relative to the
previous decade. Based on a poverty line defined as at or below $1.90 per person per
day (2011 US$ at purchasing power parity, PPP), India has lifted more than 160 million
people out of poverty in recent years, surpassed only by China (World Bank 2018c).
However, India’s growth rate has decelerated, and as of 2015 poverty remained an
intractable issue, with roughly 176 million people nationwide living below the poverty
line. At the time of this writing, India is experiencing a nationwide lockdown in
response to COVID-19, which will undoubtedly blunt economic growth and exacerbate
poverty conditions.
The social exclusion of specific groups—Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes,
other tribes, and minorities1—plays a major role in both the prevalence and the
persistence of poverty (World Bank 2016c). Twenty-eight percent of India’s population belong to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, and 43 percent of that total
remains poor. Historically determined social hierarchies and norms, including
“untouchability” and segregation of livelihoods, land, and asset ownership, ensure
that these groups continue to lag behind the general population in income, ownership
of productive assets, human capital, and access to resources and services. There is
also great regional diversity in the distribution of poverty. Seven of the poorest states,
including the state of Bihar, are home to 62 percent of India’s poor (World Bank
2018b).
Meanwhile, Bihar is one of India’s fastest-growing low-income states, but large
parts of the state remain very poor. India’s third most populous state, Bihar is home
to over 100 million people, 36 million of whom are poor. The state has long suffered
from inadequate infrastructure and weak governance. Moreover, progress across
social groups in Bihar has been uneven, with stark differences among groups in
educational attainment and types of jobs held. The poverty rate for Scheduled Castes
in the state is the highest in the country (World Bank 2016b). Bihar also has one of
the highest rates of malnutrition in the country, and although its infant mortality is
declining, it is still high. Consumption inequality has remained largely unchanged
(World Bank 2016a).
Bihar is witnessing several shifting circumstances affecting its working population.
Its agricultural productivity is one of the lowest in India, and the productivity of smallholder farmers is even lower than the average across all states (Behera et al. 2013).
Against a backdrop of low agricultural production, rural dwellers are beginning to move
off the farms and into other kinds of work, although the workforce remains largely
farm-based in the areas of dairy, poultry, and enterprises tied to agriculture. There has
been an increase in the number of jobs since 2005, but very few workers have salaried
jobs, and job creation has lagged behind the expansion of the working-age population.
In addition, state-level legislation in 2016 banning the production and consumption
of liquor has had a significant impact on poor households reliant on income from the
production and sale of country liquor.

Establishing JEEViKA: Setup, scale-up, and use of
community structures
Against this backdrop of persistent poverty and inequality, the Bihar Rural Livelihoods
Project (BRLP) was launched in 2006 in six districts and 42 blocks of Bihar with the
support of a $63 million credit (World Bank 2007). In 2012 the program received additional financing of $100 million to saturate and deepen the program in the six districts
(World Bank 2017). The success of BRLP led to the designation of JEEViKA as the state
rural livelihoods mission to implement NRLM, the national-level livelihoods program,
built on the lessons learned from JEEViKA and similar investments in the states of
Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. In 2014 BRLP was scaled up to include all
534 blocks and 38 districts of Bihar. In 2016 the Bihar Transformative Development
Project, a $290 million World Bank project, was initiated to support this scale-up and
deepen the next-generation livelihoods approach across Bihar.

Scale-up and community structures
With its scale and outreach in Bihar, JEEViKA is the largest state mission implementing
community-based livelihoods programming in India. The program has thus far mobilized more than 10 million rural women into more than 923,000 self-help groups, which
are further federated into nearly 60,000 village organizations and 1,045 cluster-level
federations. These community institutions have emerged as effective platforms for
economic inclusion, linking the poorest to the formal banking system, and for enabling
a range of services, including insurance, regular financial literacy, credit counseling,
and orientation in sound financial practices, as well as new modes of financial transactions such as digital and mobile banking (World Bank 2018a). This large institutional
platform has enabled households from the poorest areas of rural Bihar to collectively
access banking services from more than 3,672 rural bank branches. Under the program,
community institutions have leveraged credit worth roughly $1.5 billion from banks,
while generating nearly $130 million in community savings.

Core operations
As shown in figure CS2.1, JEEViKA’s core operations consist of mobilizing, supporting,
and extending program services to and through three levels of group structures: selfhelp groups, village organizations, and cluster-level federations.
Within the village, 12–15 rural women come together to form self-help groups.
JEEViKA facilitates these groups, which meet regularly, undertake financial savings,
and lend internally from the group’s common funds. JEEViKA then provides small
catalytic funding—a Community Investment Fund—to stimulate financial activity and
build the credit history of members. Locally identified resource persons—community
­mobilizers—facilitate the self-help group meetings and maintain ledgers. With proven
credit history and a small corpus generated from savings and interest, the self-help
groups are able to leverage larger amounts of credit from banks.
At the village level, 10–15 self-help groups are federated into village organizations.
These organizations act as an important interface between the local bank branch and
the member groups and facilitate ongoing credit links to local banks. Village organizations also facilitate specialized financial products, such as the Food Security Fund,
a specialized credit window for collective procurement of food grains in lean seasons,
and the Health Risk Fund, a specialized funding window for low-interest loans for
health-related costs. Village organizations are also vital platforms for convergence with

key government programs and entitlements, and they provide a platform for communities to engage effectively with other public institutions such as schools and panchayats
(community-level government).
Village organizations are further federated into cluster-level federations (CLFs),
each composed of 30–50 village organizations. These federations act as large-scale
financial intermediation platforms for addressing a wide variety of the community’s
financial needs. CLFs monitor the overall financial health of member institutions and
act as vital touch points for banks to reach out to the community.

JEEViKA as a platform
Apart from a role in higher-level financial intermediation and representation of their
constituent self-help groups, village organizations and CLFs serve as powerful organizational platforms. These structures enable JEEViKA to extend a host of livelihood
supports, including grants to support farmer producer groups mobilized across selfhelp groups, community-level poultry units, and farm infrastructure, as well as initiatives to promote community health, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices,
and a host of other services. In Bihar, the strength of these institutions is evidenced by
the fact that the village organizations and CLFs are the go-to platforms for other public
services and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) seeking to efficiently target the
poorest and improve program delivery.
JEEViKA has also initiated interventions on a pilot basis or through convergence
with other government programs to enable scaled-up access to public entitlements
for the poor. These include access to social security pensions, wage employment, and
insurance coverage—facilitating, for example, the enrollment of more than 2.2 million
members in the government insurance scheme for women, thereby insuring members
against death and disability.2

Program implementation through cadres of community implementers
JEEViKA’s ability to effectively extend programming across a large and disconnected
state depends on its human resource structure, which comprises core JEEViKA staff as
well as large cadres of community members who are trained to support programming
efforts. Over its years of operations, JEEViKA has strengthened its human resource,
monitoring and evaluation, and learning systems at the level of community institutions and at the level of various project management units—block, district, and state
197

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

(World Bank 2018a). The human resources system focuses on strong accountability
mechanisms and pays special attention to building up local technical specialist support.
As of 2019, community institutions were staffed by more than 120,000 trained
community professionals and resource persons (roughly 80 percent of whom were
women), composing cadres of specialized staff, all from local communities. These
grassroots women leaders serve as paraprofessionals, resource persons, and functionaries trained in institutional capacity building, community mobilizing, bookkeeping, and
facilitating links with commercial banks and livelihood support services.

Addressing the persistent exclusion of the poorest
As JEEViKA was expanding its coverage in Bihar, it recognized early on that the very
poorest households faced difficulties engaging with its programs and its foundational
structure, the self-help group. In part, the self-selective nature of self-help groups, by
which women would elect into and organize groups themselves, was discouraging the
poorest households, creating “self-exclusion.” JEEViKA recognized that the ultrapoor
often felt uncomfortable forming groups, sometimes because of an inability to save
regularly. The self-help group model relied on saving, group lending, regular meetings,
and financial discipline. These were demanding requirements for ultrapoor women,
who were often without enough resources for basic consumption, let alone saving and
lending. Community stigma and ostracization of poorer and vulnerable women and
families contributed to their exclusion as well.
As the project evolved, JEEViKA recognized that certain flexibilities in the self-help
group model would be required to encourage the participation of the poorest and that
community institutions could play a powerful role. To catalyze the engagement of community institutions in including the poorest, JEEViKA instituted several practices, including
introducing social inclusion as one of the seven quality indicators in village organizations’
performance assessments. This helped village organizations evolve specific strategies, such
as working closely with community resource persons as well as social action committees to
identify and contact excluded households and encourage them to join. Later, through the
efforts of the village organizations, the communities themselves made considerable efforts
to identify and include the poorest households and migrant groups (World Bank 2018a).

Extending economic inclusion through
contextual graduation
Despite progress made by JEEViKA in the economic inclusion of Bihar’s poor, a share of
poor households either remained excluded or dropped out of self-help groups. JEEViKA
realized that effectively addressing the needs of these poorest households would require
more nuanced and more targeted approaches. Without inclusion in the self-help group
structure, the omitted households would continue to have no ability to reap the broader
benefits of community institutions, access to credit, and the links to other government
and nongovernmental programming that leveraged village organizations as a platform
for service delivery. JEEViKA understood that assistance in asset building and targeted
efforts at boosting household capacities were required, as were household-level interventions for livelihood enhancement. The poorest households also likely required
coping strategies for unexpected shocks and a programmatic approach that recognized
and accounted for the health and economic setbacks that regularly push the ultrapoor
back into the deeper traps of poverty and debt (World Bank 2018a).

In August 2018, the State Cabinet of Bihar approved a budgetary outlay of approximately $120 million for a new program, Satat Jeevikoparjan Yojana (SJY), under
JEEViKA’s remit. SJY was intended to be a targeted strategy to extend JEEViKA’s
economic inclusion efforts to 100,000 of its poorest constituents. The program was also
seen as an avenue to countering the loss of livelihoods from the recent outlawing of
liquor consumption and production in the state.
An earlier pilot graduation program, Targeting the Hard-Core Poor (THCP), had borne
many lessons and insights for JEEViKA, including how to augment the graduation approach
to work within its core program offerings and infrastructure. Several randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) revealed that the graduation approach had positive results on the income,
asset, and consumption levels of the poorest, among other indicators (Banerjee et al. 2015).
Considered key to its success is the catalytic and ­combinatory effect of its sequenced inputs,
which are thought to result in a “big push” to the household, enabling a rise in income and
consumption levels, assets, savings, and human capital dimensions. In scale-up, as in pilot
mode, JEEViKA retained core graduation components and the engagement of research and
technical partners (see table CS2.1). The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), a
research and policy organization that had conducted several RCTs on graduation approaches,
is currently conducting research on the operations of SJY and is planning an impact assessment. Bandhan Konnagar, a West Bengal–based NGO, is providing technical guidance based
on its experience as one of the early adapters of graduation programming in India.
SJY is one of the largest known government scale-ups of graduation programming;

Funding and costs
National, state, World Bank, and philanthropic funding have combined synergistically
to support SJY. The cost per household of the SJY intervention is roughly Rs 77,000
($1,040) per household. Roughly Rs 67,000 ($900)3 covers direct inputs to the household, including the Livelihoods Gap Assistance Fund and asset transfers (Livelihood
Investment Fund). The remaining $140 per household covers human resources
(community cadres and staff) and their capacity building.
State-level funding of $120 million supports all transfers and assets to participating households. Funding provided by the national government and the World Bank
supports JEEViKA’s human resources, systems, and operations at large, including those
devoted to the SJY scale-up. In addition to government funding and support, SJY benefits from external philanthropic funding support, which is utilized for technical assistance to the JEEViKA team for operational research and to enhance the monitoring
tools used in the SJY scale-up.

Moving to scale leveraging established infrastructure
and policy objectives
SJY is a functional expansion of JEEViKA’s economic inclusion programming, which
has already reached more than 10 million rural women and represents coverage of more
than 46.6 million individuals in Bihar. With a goal of reaching 100,000 households

BOX CS2.1 SJY at a Glance: Key Scale-Up Components (and Variations from the Pilot)
SJY coverage and targeting
To date, Satat Jeevikoparjan Yojana (SJY) has targeted more than 70,000 ultrapoor households in Bihar in all 38 districts, across 233 of 534 blocks. Rapid targeting of participants
has been enabled by leveraging community structures and modifying the original pilot
targeting approach. The targeting and selection of beneficiaries in the pilot had closely
followed the Bandhan Konnagar and BRAC graduation modelsa and included social
mapping, community wealth ranking, and house-to-house verification of program entry
criteria. However, this targeting method was considered too time-consuming for a scale-up
and was changed significantly for SJY. SJY retained a simpler transect walk and social
mapping exercise and simplified the wealth ranking process. In its place, the input of the
village organizations was solicited to identify and rank the poorest people. Block-level project implementation units carried out a final check on the endorsed list of SJY participants.
SJY implementation arrangements
Notably, SJY is JEEViKA’s first attempt to mainstream a program that works with households as the unit of intervention instead of group structures. To implement SJY at the
household level, JEEViKA leans on its organized village organizations, which lend input
and support to key functions such as targeting, endorsement of selected households,
initial asset procurement, and routing of funds to the households. Active implementation of the program is largely in the hands of community cadres—community resource

persons—established by JEEViKA to handle functions such as targeting for SJY through
intensive community-level drives. Meanwhile, a new type of cadre, consisting of “master
resource persons,” is dedicated to the SJY program, handling the coaching and household-level work of SJY. JEEViKA staff, together with a Bandhan Konnagar resource
person at the block level, provide households with training on specific livelihoods and
offer overall supervisory support for the program (see figure BCS2.1).

 JY at a Glance: Key Scale-Up Components (and Variations from the Pilot)
(continued)
Productive assets
SJY participants choose a productive asset from a list of choices determined by
local context and needs, and then they receive asset-specific skills training and
weekly household coaching. After completing the training, they take possession
of the assets, typically in two or three tranches. Asset packages may include various types of livestock, sewing machines, farm inputs, inventory for a small shop, or
other contextually relevant productive assets. Early trends from households indicate
that small-scale ­trading enterprises and livestock are the preferred options for first
tranche assets.
The first tranche value of the Livelihood Investment Fund is pegged at a maximum of
Rs 20,000 ($280). Households may choose a diverse activity in the second or third
tranche, and the total value of assets is estimated to be Rs 60,000 ($840). Participants
also receive a temporary subsistence allowance called the Livelihood Gap Assistance
Fund of Rs 1,000 ($14) per month paid over seven months. This allowance is intended
to encourage higher consumption and to offset the opportunity costs of learning how to
put the new enterprise asset into use before it begins to generate income.
Coaching
Participating households receive weekly coaching. During coaching, master resource
persons provide a range of support that may include guidance on care and maintenance of assets, proper care of livestock, guidance on building microenterprises, or
help in gaining essential skills such as learning how to sign one’s name, basic numeracy, and bookkeeping skills. The weekly coaching sessions also include a social
education component, with discussions on topics ranging from nutrition to early
marriage and family planning.
a. BRAC is an international nongovernmental organization with headquarters in Bangladesh.

(and coverage of roughly 500,000 individuals), SJY is itself an ambitious scale-up of
a contextual and rigorous graduation approach, extending JEEViKA’s reach and core
services, which are centered around access to financing, market links, and access
to public entitlement programs in the direction of livelihoods enhancement for the
extreme poor. As of early 2020, more than 70,000 households had been successfully
targeted and endorsed to receive the SJY intervention.
JEEViKA’s wide coverage and scale can be attributed in part to its institutional
structure and staffing. JEEViKA was launched in 2006 as an autonomous agency with
an independent executive committee and chief executive officer and a professional staff
(see box CS2.2). In later years, the same structure was adopted by several other state
rural livelihoods missions and other government agencies. This structure as well as
strong training and accountability measures have largely insulated JEEViKA from some
of the governance issues that historically have faced the state’s agencies, including
elite capture and leakage of funds. A long-standing partnership with the World Bank
has enabled the program to establish strong financial management systems as well as
robust mechanisms for redressing grievances.

SJY: Key Roles and Funders

Roles
•• Implementer: JEEViKA (government)
•• Technical assistance partner: Bandhan Konnagar
•• Knowledge and learning partner: J-PAL
Funders
•• Core JEEViKA human resources, systems, and operations: Jointly funded by the
national government of India and World Bank
•• SJY scale-up operational funding: Funded by state of Bihar
•• Technical assistance and operational research funding: Philanthropic funding from
Co-Impact and IKEA Foundation
Note: SJY = Satat Jeevikoparjan Yojana; J-PAL= Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab.

The SJY scale-up benefits from being integrated into a larger institutionalized
economic inclusion effort: JEEViKA at the state level and NRLM at the national level.
SJY is strongly aligned with state and national level policy objectives and is considered
a key piece of JEEViKA’s overall policy goal of “saturation”—that is, inclusion of and
service provision for the poor. SJY’s scale-up benefits from state and national funding
and JEEViKA’s well-developed and adaptive delivery systems and infrastructure, all of
which have supported an altogether new programmatic approach that has effectively
found its footing in Bihar. NRLM, conceptualized at the national level based on the
lessons of JEEViKA and similar programs in other states, offers a broad landscape to
institutionalize the experiences of SJY on a national scale.
SJY leverages JEEViKA-catalyzed community structures, such as village organizations and community cadres, effectively institutionalizing community capacity for
its program delivery. In the move from pilot to scale-up, one decision rooted the SJY
scale-up firmly in the fabric of JEEViKA’s core programming: the move to make use of
community structures in selecting SJY households and in other key implementation
steps. For JEEViKA, a successful shift in programming from a 2,000-household pilot to
a 100,000-household scale-up implied that the approach would have to be seamlessly
integrated into JEEViKA’s core community structures, leveraging their strengths and
operational capacity. Village organizations and their constituent self-help groups came
to the forefront as a source of inputs into the SJY beneficiary selection process. In addition, community structures are now involved at key implementation junctures, including the channeling of money through village organizations to SJY households and the
use of village organization procurement committees to source and distribute assets to
households.

Key partnerships supported by catalytic funding
The institutional capacity of JEEViKA to design and implement the SJY scale-up was
enhanced through partnerships with several external organizations, which enabled
key technical guidance and operational learning support. The expertise and guidance
provided by Bandhan Konnagar in a technical assistance capacity and J-PAL South Asia

203

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

as a knowledge and learning partner allowed a learning-by-doing and iterative
approach for JEEViKA.
Bandhan Konnagar provides JEEViKA with dedicated staff who advise community
resource persons, master resource persons, and JEEViKA staff on key implementation
steps. It has also provided training materials for staff and cadres, program implementation guidelines and tools, and monitoring forms and formats during both the Targeting
the Hard-Core Poor pilot and the SJY scale-up.
J-PAL has assumed an operational research role to help ensure effective real-time
learning of operational lessons. It regularly reviews operational challenges, and in doing
so it observes the implementation of key steps, including targeting, household microplanning, and asset transfers to date. It then offers feedback to JEEViKA on the efficacy
of each step, potential areas for improvement, and, where possible, avenues to facilitate
efficiency at scale. In addition to its current role supporting operational learning, J-PAL
hopes to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the SJY program in the future.
Catalytic philanthropic funding has been central to equipping JEEViKA with a project management unit, technical assistance, and operational research support for SJY.
Although many state, national, and multilateral budgets finance implementation and
direct inputs to households, funding for other vital elements of large-scale government
programming is not always as readily available. These vital elements include technical
assistance, development of the required infrastructure and systems, and research on
process and outcomes. Catalytic investments by philanthropic donors and private sector
actors can bridge these critical gaps. Grants from Co-Impact4 and the IKEA Foundation5
allowed expansion of Bandhan’s and J-PAL’s involvement beyond the Targeting the
Hard-Core Poor pilot, enabling the provision of additional technical inputs to assist in
a wider scale-up effort and help ensure effective learning of operational lessons and
documentation. In addition, philanthropic funding has supported JEEViKA’s investments in monitoring technologies for SJY, including the development of mobile applications to allow implementing staff and community cadres to capture program data and
milestones on their phones. All ultrapoor households under SJY are now registered on
a mobile application, and programmatic inputs and key outcomes are digitally tracked
on the platform.

Lessons
Programmatic lessons
For JEEViKA, both the Targeting the Hard-Core Poor pilot and the SJY scale-up have
confirmed the notion that to effectively reach the poorest and most vulnerable people,
a more intensive approach is required. Although economic inclusion at scale can be
achieved through its core livelihoods and financial inclusion activities, JEEViKA has
committed to a higher-touch, and in some ways higher-intensity, graduation approach,
working directly with households as opposed to groups to effectively engage the
­poorest and most persistently excluded.
As SJY and its preceding pilot were being implemented, it quickly became
clear that adapting the originally envisioned graduation approach was necessary to
­effectively institutionalize it within the larger JEEViKA programmatic model. When
embarking on the Targeting the Hard-Core Poor pilot, JEEViKA leaders were keen
to follow the tried and tested graduation approach as closely as possible to benchmark its operations and ensure impacts. But by the time they decided to scale up SJY,
they understood that adaptations were required to allow successful integration of the
approach into its core program infrastructure and community cadres.

204

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

Unlike in many other global adaptations of graduation approaches, in SJY most of
the programmatic changes and lessons learned are related to the way in which the original graduation components are delivered, as opposed to changes to the components
themselves. JEEViKA has embraced the intensity of graduation approach components,
electing not to pare down the model, in contrast to several international government
agencies, which have sought to use a “graduation-lite” approach. The most substantive
changes have aimed at allowing the program to effectively leverage existing community structures. Graduation program components themselves have not been eliminated
or reduced. In fact, in the scale-up the value of asset transfers has tripled on average.
And although several global graduation programs are moving to home visits every two
weeks, JEEViKA has maintained weekly coaching and coaching at the household level
over the 24-month course of the program.
An ambitious mandate to scale up, coupled with the relative novelty of working
directly with households, poses ongoing challenges. SJY’s priority is to scale up as
quickly as possible in order to keep pace with the available funding resources. A clear
mandate to scale up puts pressure on identifying, training, and retaining high-quality
master resource persons, who are responsible for the bulk of household-level programming inputs. As targeting efforts are under way, community resource persons are being
trained in large numbers to conduct targeting activities, and village organizations are
being tapped to help identify households through targeting drives.
The results of operational research so far have revealed exclusion errors, but no
noticeable inclusion errors. Errors of exclusion, in which deserving households are
left out, are reasonable in the early days of a program, are fixable with later rounds
of programming, and are less problematic than inclusion errors, which can indicate
­leakage and elite capture of programs. The early days of SJY have also seen other
anomalies, including over-targeting of households with disabilities (proportional to the
population). This anomaly is likely because community resource persons and village
organizations, in their new roles of household identification, more readily recognize
people with disabilities as meeting program entry criteria without nuanced regard of
who may have limited means to engage in economic activities.
The fast-paced scale-up has had impacts on households as well. SJY households
with completed asset transfers are increasingly competing with other subsistence-level
enterprises in the community, as well as with themselves. JEEViKA is in the early
stages of tracking whether and where clusters of enterprises could be formed to facilitate aggregated interventions, such as retail marts and cooperatives, to facilitate more
streamlined market access and better pricing for farmers and small traders.
As JEEViKA learns in real time about the effectiveness of its programming, it is
considering additional methods to mitigate against loss of quality and impacts, while
preserving the fast pace of the SJY scale-up. To stem capacity constraints, JEEViKA
has moved to quickly recruit and deploy a pool of young professionals to support the
program scale-up, and it has instituted training drives to prepare cadres of community
resource persons to undertake targeting and to prepare master resource persons for
household-level programming. With the support of philanthropic funding, JEEViKA is
also constituting a professional project management unit to shore up professional staff
in oversight and managerial positions for the scale-up. Because the program is sequential, JEEViKA is batching and phasing activities, attempting to create competencies at
scale and, potentially, specialization within activities. The best-performing staff and
master resource persons are quickly converted to trainers to extend their expertise, and
JEEViKA has appointed dedicated human resources to the program at the district level
to ensure ongoing technical oversight. JEEViKA is also considering avenues to standardize and digitize content both for training master resource persons and for training
and coaching program participants. It will likely move toward video-based training and
modules to be delivered via hand-held projectors.
205

Institutional lessons
Although it is still at an early stage of implementation, SJY is one of the largest
known government scale-ups of graduation programming within a larger economic
­inclusion effort. Accordingly, SJY and its host program, JEEViKA, have the potential
to offer nationally and globally relevant lessons for economic inclusion of the extreme
poor. India’s National Rural Livelihoods Mission, with its nationwide infrastructure
and resources, has nationalized economic inclusion efforts that organize the poor in
self-help groups and connect them to formal financial services, public entitlements,
and livelihood-enhancing support (World Bank 2011b). If SJY proves successful, the
program could demonstrate that such efforts are an effective way to extend economic
inclusion, financial inclusion, and the public entitlement offerings of state and national
governments to the country’s unreached extreme poor. In India, NRLM’s national infrastructure can extend SJY lessons across the country. Indeed, NRLM’s state agencies
have a history of borrowing implementation practices and lessons learned from leading
states (World Bank 2011a).
Although many governments look to graduation approaches as a way to move
households through and out of government interventions, JEEViKA seeks the opposite result. It regards the approach as a way to boost the capacities of households,
enabling them to move on to JEEViKA’s core programming. That programming is
driven by a statewide “saturation” mandate, the success of which is predicated on
self-selection and the election of services by all eligible households. Rather than
seeking to move (graduate) SJY households out of the program, JEEViKA focuses on
the degree to which SJY households can be mainstreamed into self-sustaining selfhelp groups and village organizations.
The SJY experience within JEEViKA provides a possible blueprint for scaling up
economic inclusion through the entry point of livelihoods programming, while utilizing financial inclusion building blocks. SJY differs from the better-known “cash plus”
approach of government agencies, which leverages social safety net infrastructure
and cash transfers to extend economic inclusion programming. It is primarily a livelihoods intervention delivered through financial inclusion infrastructure. Although the
intervention itself provides inputs to participating households centered on boosting
productive assets and skills, its delivery relies on the support of self-help groups and
village organizations. SJY may therefore provide insights into how various global financial inclusion approaches and platforms could be tapped to reach increasingly poorer
households. Globally, these approaches and platforms could include government-­
catalyzed self-help group programs, large-scale village savings and loan programs, and
other financial inclusion and community structures.
JEEViKA’s SJY program offers insights into how community structures can
enhance economic inclusion efforts and, potentially, seed greater impacts at the
community level. JEEViKA’s self-help groups and higher structures are not merely
financial inclusion structures. The prevailing philosophy behind them is one of
community mobilization and building the countervailing power of the poor. The
approach leverages upstream community structures. It remains to be seen whether
economic and social inclusion outcomes can be enhanced by this community participation and leverage.
The use of community cadres to deliver graduation programming could contribute to the discourse around how to ease the persistent capacity constraints of
economic inclusion efforts. Distinct from more typical channels of NGO or government service delivery, JEEViKA’s training and involvement of large numbers of
community members in various cadres could serve as a model for delivering the often
high-intensity and high-touch programming of economic inclusion interventions. In
addition to enabling program delivery, JEEViKA’s model of training large numbers of
206

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

community workers is intended to empower the community in a real sense as agents
of change. It also ensures the transfer of programmatic practice and knowledge to
the community.
Implementation of SJY may offer significant lessons on moving to scale-up.
If SJY is able to successfully scale up to its target of 100,000 households in three
years, it will be in part because of significant previous market-making investments
by JEEViKA. These include developing community cadres and infrastructure and
investing in value chain development and a rich tapestry of other support services
and programs to which JEEViKA attempts to link participants. A scaled-up SJY
could shed light on key elements of graduation and economic inclusion programming that have the power to drive, or conversely inhibit, further scale-up. The costs
of the program are high, and the sustainability of the approach over a longer term
will depend on its ability to evolve strategically into a convergence approach—one
in which the resources and benefits of other public programs can be leveraged in
support of the poorest people. Because of the phased approach of the program,
there is an opportunity for and interest in exploring a convergence approach for a
subset of households.
The outcomes of SJY will also offer lessons on adequate dosages of graduation and
economic inclusion inputs among poor households, on meeting the capacity needed to
deliver comprehensive economic inclusion approaches, and on ways to internalize new
programmatic processes into existing operations. In summary, the outcomes will reveal
the feasibility of achieving the elusive goal of reaching the last mile of poverty and help
determine whether more states and programs may follow a similar path.

CASE STUDY 3

Adapting BRAC’s Graduation Program
to the Changing Poverty Context in
Bangladesh
Introduction
BRAC, an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) headquartered in
Bangladesh, was already engaged in large-scale development programming when it
began to develop its flagship graduation program. Prompted to rethink its approach
in the early 2000s when evaluations revealed that its existing programs to promote
food security and livelihoods were not serving the needs of the poorest, BRAC developed a new program that was scaled up nationwide within a few years. Building on the
experience and infrastructure of its other programs, BRAC saw its program reach over
2 million households by 2020, with some 100,000 female heads of households accepted
into the program each year. Randomized controlled trials of BRAC’s program revealed
sizable economic impacts that have been sustained seven years after participants
entered the program (Bandiera et al. 2017).
This case study explores BRAC’s experience evolving the graduation approach over
the last 20 years, paying special attention to the lessons for governments and NGOs
alike that have emerged from the most recent periods of implementation. Specifically,
this case study looks at how, since the program started in 2002, BRAC has sought to
ensure high program quality and maximize sustainable impacts, at scale, in a changing poverty context. By employing a historical perspective from nearly two decades of
program implementation, the study reflects the reality that graduation and economic
inclusion programs require staying power enabled by long-term investment and innovation supported by research.
The case study brings into focus aspects of program delivery, emphasizing the
principles and processes that have enabled the program’s strong impacts and the
rigorous learning practices undertaken by BRAC to correct course when the program
has shown signs of ineffectiveness. BRAC has attributed the success of the program
largely to an ethos of learning and critical self-evaluation that is deeply embedded
in the way BRAC has developed and continually improved the program. After nearly
15 years of implementation, however, it became clear that the program’s components
needed more significant reimagining. BRAC relied heavily on research and evaluation
teams to provide the analytical basis for changes to what were previously considered
the core elements of its graduation model. This case study looks into how, despite
­compelling external evidence that BRAC’s program was having an impact, the organization ­transformed the program, introducing new elements not previously associated with
graduation programming. It will situate this series of decisions and activities within
the broader context of the evolution of the program and the shifting poverty context of
Bangladesh since the early 2000s.

This case study was written by Isabel Whisson, with contributions from Rozina Haque, Julie Kedroske, and
Munshi Sulaiman (from BRAC), and Imran Matin, Narayan Das, and Syed Hashemi (from BRAC University).

Context
The macroeconomic context in Bangladesh has changed considerably since the early
2000s. The country has experienced steady growth in its gross domestic product (GDP)
despite external shocks. Over the last 15 years, the growth rate has remained consistently over 5 percent.1 There has also been an impressive steady reduction in poverty.
In 2000, 49 percent of the population was poor. That rate then declined to 31.5 percent
in 2010 and 21.8 percent in 2018. Extreme poverty declined from 34.3 percent in 2000
to 17.6 percent in 2010 and further to 10.5 percent in 2019.2 Likewise, over the 20-year
period per capita incomes increased and food insecurity decreased, and access to
­financial services expanded significantly, especially in rural areas.
Achievements in the social sectors over the last two decades have also been impressive. Household size has decreased, infant and neonatal mortality rates have fallen,
and primary school attendance has become almost universal. These changes have been
driven by robust growth in the agriculture sector, increased international remittances,
and a thriving export-oriented ready-made garment manufacturing industry (Hill and
Genoni 2019). Meanwhile, since the 2000s government programming has increased
significantly in quality and efficacy against a backdrop in which NGOs have played a
critical role in filling the void in social services since independence in 1972.

BOX CS3.1

Political and Policy Drivers of BRAC’s Graduation Programming

Bangladesh came into being in the early 1970s as one of the poorest countries in
the world. Emerging from its war of independence with a strong redistributive ethos
supported by a highly active and reality-grounded public discourse on poverty and
vulnerability, the government galvanized a succession of social and policy initiatives to
address poverty. Nongovernmental organization innovations complemented the delivery of social protection services.
A key finding of extensive academic research on poverty dynamics during the 1980s,
backed up by BRAC’s experience in rural areas, was the heterogeneity of the population
in poverty. Researchers and practitioners identified a subgroup of the poor, referred to
variously as the hard-core poor, the ultrapoor, or the extreme poor, who earned less and
had fewer assets, faced far more limited livelihood opportunities, experienced higher
food insecurity and greater vulnerability to periodic economic shocks, and endured more
intense social marginalization. Detailed estimates indicated that 27 percent of the rural
population was in this category, and they were not being reached by most government
and NGO development programs, including microfinance. It was against this backdrop
that BRAC implemented in 1987, with the government of Bangladesh and the World Food
Programme, its Income Generation for Vulnerable Group Development (IGVGD) program.
Subsequently, BRAC’s graduation program built on learning from IGVGD. The core idea
was to target the poorest—that is, those who are routinely excluded from development
programs—and provide an intervention that combined social safety net (SSN) support
to ensure basic food security with a livelihood strategy for earning incomes that would
eventually negate the need for continued consumption support.
Note: BRAC is an international nongovernmental organization with headquarters in Bangladesh.

Sub-Saharan Africa. In the field of economic inclusion, BRAC is widely associated with
the graduation approach—a programming methodology that promotes strong ­livelihood,
social empowerment, and financial inclusion outcomes for the ­poorest populations. The
flagship graduation program, which BRAC launched in 2002 in Bangladesh as a pilot
with 5,000 households, now enrolls up to 100,000 households a year. This rapid scale-up
was enabled by a large network of branch offices established by BRAC’s microfinance
program, which already operated nationwide. As of 2020, the program in Bangladesh
had reached more than 2 million households—nearly 9 million people. Rigorous evaluations conducted by BRAC’s independent research arm and the London School of
Economics have revealed significant impacts across a range of ­development indicators,
including income, asset value, consumption, and savings (Bandiera et al. 2017).
Yet after more than a decade of implementation, the drivers of poverty and political
economy had begun to shift in Bangladesh, prompting a redesign of BRAC’s program.
Consistent economic growth and the government’s investment in public services have
contributed to significantly changing the context of extreme poverty in Bangladesh.
According to BRAC, the annual household income of the poorest participants entering
the program rose from $80 in 2002 to $188 in 2016. Food insecurity was all but resolved
in Bangladesh, as reflected in the higher spending on nonfood expenditures, even by
the poorest. The daily per capita food expenditure of households entering the program
increased from $0.30 in 2002 to $0.48 in 2016. Indicators of education and hygiene also
improved. By 2016, 13 percent of household heads were literate, compared with just
4 percent in 2002, and 43 percent had a sanitary latrine, compared with 7 percent in
2002. It was also increasingly common for the poorest households to have access to
some services provided by government, NGOs, or microfinance institutions. In addition to the changed nature of poverty, the geographic spread of poverty in Bangladesh
shifted as well. Whereas the program had originally been implemented in 42 districts
of Bangladesh (roughly two-thirds of the country), by 2016 the remaining pockets of
extreme poverty were concentrated in fewer areas.
Beyond macroeconomic changes in Bangladesh that rendered aspects of the current
program less relevant, analysis of data from the randomized controlled trial revealed
the significant heterogeneity of impacts. Although the data showed significant positive
impacts on average, they obscured the fact that many participants thrived considerably,
while many were only nominally better off and did not demonstrate a strong trajectory in livelihood growth (Bandiera et al. 2012). This pattern was clear-cut among older
women who often had limited ability to engage in income-generating activities.

BRAC graduation approach, an iterative response
Although BRAC is known for the graduation approach, the effectiveness of the program
has been sustained over a long period of time through continual adaptation. Developed
in the early 2000s, the program was born out of learning from BRAC’s previous long
period of program implementation. It was established to address the finding by evaluators at BRAC that its existing programs did not do enough to build the long-term
capacity of the poorest households it was reaching across Bangladesh to enter into
sustainable livelihoods. A continued assessment of the program’s responsiveness to a
changing poverty context, enabled by learning processes that were embedded into all
aspects of program development, iteration, rollout, scale-up, and implementation, were
key to ensuring the program’s continued relevance.
From 2002 to 2016, BRAC implemented several iterations of the graduation program.
It rigorously targeted the poorest households in communities across the 42 districts of
Bangladesh known to have the deepest pockets of extreme poverty. Female heads of
households were entered into a program that included (1) a weekly stipend to cover
211

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

essential needs for the first few months; (2) enterprise training; (3) productive asset
transfers (valued at approximately $100); (4) weekly household coaching and monitoring visits; (5) access to savings; (6) biweekly visits from a community health worker;
(7) life skills development training; and (8) monthly ­meetings of the village poverty
reduction committee. This program lasted 24 months at a cost of $450–$550 per household. Meanwhile, BRAC realized that another population was slightly better-off than
the poorest but was nonetheless too vulnerable for ­microfinance alone. For this second
group, BRAC adjusted the graduation program to include the same components just
described, with the stipulation that assets would be transferred as part of a soft loan that
participants would have to repay over the course of the program period.
In a more recent round of changes starting in 2017, BRAC again confronted the
need to significantly reform its long-standing graduation program. This process was
guided by two questions: Which program elements are essential for the extreme poor
in the current context? What elements or components of the program could BRAC
­optimize to be more efficient?
Four design and implementation considerations loomed large in these discussions:
1. Heterogeneity of impacts. Women over a certain age invested less time and money in
their enterprises and saw smaller economic gains.
2. Sustainability of impact. Livelihood packages needed to remain large enough for the
poorest households to earn a decent income in an evolving market.
3. Shifts in financial capacity. Any continued financial support must account for changing consumption patterns and levels of food security.
4. Operational and cost efficiencies. The program design and operations should explore
opportunities to simplify or reduce inputs wherever it would not compromise impacts.
Although BRAC was open to revising all the components of the program,
it remained faithful to two principles: (1) a focus on reaching the poorest, and
(2) ­delivery of a package of interventions that would empower the poorest households both socially and economically to attain sustainable livelihoods. These principles
ensured that staff, who included some with decades of field experience, focused on the
outcomes needed in modern-day Bangladesh and not simply on the activities they had
been accustomed to implementing. Adaptive program design in support of outcomes
was also enabled by a flexible funding agreement in place from 2011 to 2020 with the
United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID) and Australia’s
Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).
BRAC segmented participant selection based on age group as well as wealth c­ ategory.
The core program would focus on women under the age of 50. Among this group,
participants were split into two groups—the poorest and those slightly better-off—with
interventions tailored to each. Women over the age of 50 would receive a less resource-­
intensive package of support and would be connected to other government services.
The cost per household of implementing the program came down from $550
to approximately $350 for most participants. Although BRAC increased the value
of the asset transfers, it also identified cost efficiencies in program components,
­management, and operations that enabled it to reduce the overall operating costs.
The program rolled out the changes in 2017 in a phased approach, initially
to roughly half of its annual capacity—45,000 households—giving staff the space
to work out kinks in implementation and enabling cross-learning among field
staff. Once the program was scaled back up to 100,000 households in 2018, BRAC
targeted the 36 districts in which poverty was most concentrated. The program
further accounted for contextual differences in environment between regions. Box
CS3.2 provides an overview of the newly designed program.

Overview of the BRAC Ultra Poor Graduation Program (2017 Onward)

Targeting
Targeting was based on three approaches: (1) poverty mapping; (2) participatory rural
appraisal; and (3) household verification via survey.
Program components for women under age 50
Productive asset transfer. Options include livestock such as cows, goats, and chickens, or a combination of agriculture, fisheries, and small trade. Assets are transferred as
an ­interest-free partial loan valued at $200. Participants in both the poorest and better-off
wealth categories repay 30–50 percent and 80 percent of the asset value, respectively,
over 24 months.
Livelihood training. Ten days of enterprise development training, of which seven days are
tailored to the specific enterprise a participant selected.
Financial services. Savings matched at 1:1, up to $1.20 per month, and credit shield life
insurance.
Life skills training. Biweekly group-based training on a range of topics related to child
welfare, health, safety, and women’s issues.
Household coaching. Biweekly individual household visits to monitor progress of participants, including their enterprises, understanding of life skills topics, and financial management, and to offer guidance and support.
Community mobilization and integration. Bimonthly village social solidarity committees
(VSSCs) to promote social integration and raise voices of the extreme poor within the community.
Links to health care. Reserve fund is set aside in the event of medical emergencies, which
BRAC would cover. For general ailments, local managers are present at the local government
clinic for four hours one day a week to ensure that participants and their families can access
health care as needed.
Intervention period. 24 months.
Program cost per household. $350.
Program adaptations for women over age 50
Productive asset transfer. Options include livestock, agriculture, and small trade. Assets are
transferred on a grant basis and are valued at $60–$95. Participant does not receive credit
shield insurance facility.
Links to government social safety nets. BRAC shares a list of participants with local government officials, so participants can enroll in a range of SSNs for which they may be eligible,
including allowances for the elderly, widows, and persons with disabilities and other special
programs. Because of government quotas, only a small proportion of participants are successfully admitted.
Intervention period. 12 months.
Program cost per household. $200.
Note: BRAC is an international nongovernmental organization with headquarters in Bangladesh.

BRAC’s 2017 programmatic shifts
Revision of participant selection and segmentation
BRAC decided to resegment its target populations to address heterogeneities between
the working-age population and the elderly to maximize impact and cost-effectiveness.
BRAC observed that participants over age 50 were less likely to reinvest in and grow
their assets beyond a certain point, nor did those participants usually have physically
able members of the household to support their work. By contrast, participants under
age 50 were much more likely to diversify and grow their assets. For example, according to data from households that entered the program in 2007, 19 percent of households
without working-age members would enroll in microfinance, compared with 28 percent
of households with working-age members. By 2014 these numbers had dropped to
13 percent and 23 percent, respectively.
Among the same cohort, four years after entering the program women over age 50 had
increased their annual household income by $82, whereas in households with women under
age 50 income increased by $200. The program needed to draw better distinctions between
who would benefit from which protective and productive mechanisms. BRAC concluded that
among those identified as being in the poorest category, there would always be people with
limited productive capacity who must receive some support and be linked to social safety nets
(SSNs) to ensure a minimum dignified existence that could be sustained.
Although the most cost-effective solution would have been to exclude the elderly
from the program and target households that had productive labor, BRAC took a
different approach. To ensure that all households continued to receive support, BRAC
adapted its packages of support to target groups based on age and on the slightly varying wealth categories among the working-age extreme poor. Women in households with
no family members between the ages of 16 and 50 would receive a similar package of
support for 12 months instead of 24 months, receive a productive asset of lower value
relative to households with more productive capacity, and receive household visits once
a month. For older women, the program would facilitate access to government SSNs,
depending on women’s eligibility and availability.
BRAC revised its definition of the poorest and which households were eligible for
graduation. Previously, it had distinguished between the poorest households and those
that had slightly more wealth and productive capacity in the household. Households
in the latter category had been required to pay for their assets with soft loans, but
received all other graduation program inputs. With the evolution of the poverty landscape in Bangladesh, this group had become fairly indistinguishable from BRAC’s mainstream microfinance program clients. BRAC therefore decided the group would not be
targeted by the graduation program moving forward. Instead, most of the graduation
program would focus on the poorer households with women under age 50. BRAC data
indicated that these households invest the most in assets, in diversifying their incomes,
and in children’s welfare, leading to the greatest benefits over longer periods of time.
BRAC recognized that levels of vulnerability would still vary among this group, and
therefore within this group it distinguished between those who were the poorest and
those who were slightly better-off, adjusting program terms for each. See box CS3.3 for
BRAC’s selection criteria and segmentation of program participants, revised in 2017.

Changes to program components
Removed consumption stipend. The program removed the weekly stipend of $2.80.
When first conceived, the stipend was designed to ensure that households could meet

their necessary caloric intake and guard against selling off assets to pay for food.
By 2016, even the poorest households were able to meet their basic food needs, and the
value of the consumption stipend was deemed to bring a negligible financial benefit.
Increased value and choice of productive assets. Conversely, BRAC recognized that
the approximate $100 value assigned to the productive assets provided before 2016 was
no longer on pace with most markets and had limited income growth ­potential. The
program doubled the value of the productive asset for women under 50, giving households an even bigger push to becoming self-sufficient. This decision was informed by
the study by Bandiera et al. (2017), which suggests that BRAC’s graduation program
in earlier years had broken the poverty trap for the poorest by providing a sufficiently
large injection of resources to enable the extreme poor to access productive opportunities otherwise inaccessible to them. Market assessments indicated that a significant
increase in asset value would enable households to compete in local markets, bringing

215

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

sufficient financial returns to participants to make up for the added cost. The program
also expanded the number of livelihood options available to participants, taking advantage of new opportunities within local markets and ways to avoid increasing competition between households.
Changed payment for productive assets to partial loans with flexible terms and
protections. The profile of participants under age 50 entering the program had changed;
they were not as vulnerable or resource-constrained as participants in earlier years.
They were more likely than earlier participants to own some land, earn some income,
or have been exposed to microfinance (widely available across rural Bangladesh
by then). They also demonstrated higher aspirations—wanting to feel a sense of ownership as opposed to dependence on aid. These considerations informed the decision to
require all participants under age 50 to repay some of the asset value. Specifically, the
poorest would have to repay 30–50 percent of the asset value, and better-off participants
would repay 100 percent of the asset value, interest-free, by the end of the 24-month
program. Repayment was later reduced to 80 percent for the latter group. The collection
of installments would be administered by BRAC’s microfinance program. Participants
would have a grace period of one month. In addition, all participants would receive
two vouchers that entitled them to a 15-day installment deferment. The vouchers gave
participants flexibility in the event they faced a period of higher expenses or diminished
cash flow. The graduation program leveraged other new products and services being
widely offered by BRAC’s microfinance program, such as credit shield life insurance for
all participants, whereby the repayment balance is forgiven in the event an earner in the
household passes away. In such cases, BRAC returns the principal the household had
already paid back, plus an additional financial benefit of $118 to support funeral costs.
Increased financial management support. The decision to introduce partial asset
value repayment to all participants underscored and increased the importance of coaching support for participants. During household visits, program officers would provide
one-on-one guidance on tracking income and expenditures, calculating how much to
set aside for savings and installments and planning for income growth or diversification. In addition, BRAC microfinance staff, who administered the biweekly meetings
on installment and savings collections, provided routine guidance on the terms and
expectations of repayment and savings collection.
Introduced a match savings mechanism. A critical outcome of the program was
to build financial resilience by encouraging regular savings behavior and ensuring a
sizable savings balance in the event of financial shocks. As program staff conducted
learning visits of similar programs implemented in Bangladesh, BRAC learned of a
“savings match” component in the government program Ektee Bari, Ektee Khamar
(One Farm, One House). As a result, BRAC introduced a match savings mechanism to
further give participants an incentive to save regularly. For every 1 Bangladesh taka
($0.01) saved, BRAC would match it two to one, up to a maximum of Tk 100 ($1.20).
BRAC later revised the match to one to one to promote greater financial independence.
Alternated individual household visits with group visits. BRAC moved from weekly
individual home visits to alternating between biweekly home visits and biweekly group
visits. This change enabled BRAC to bring the staff-to-participant ratio down, while
maintaining touch points with staff at four times per month.
Revised life skills training curriculum. BRAC added a focus on noncommunicable
diseases to the curriculum because such diseases had become a leading cause of higher
morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh.
Adjusted terms of village social solidarity committees. Village committee s­ chedules
were changed to every two months instead of once a month, with the option to call
an emergency meeting sooner if needed. This change helped to reduce the w
­ orkload
of branch managers, who previously were administering 12–13 committees at a time.

216

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

Furthermore, sometimes issues raised in the committee meetings could not be resolved
within a month.
Linked participants to health and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services.
Instead of continuing to provide participants directly with sanitary latrines, the program
linked participants to BRAC’s water and sanitation program, thereby reducing costs. The
widespread availability of government health services across Bangladesh also meant the
program could link participants in need to the health care providers operating locally
instead of to BRAC’s health program. Program staff would also leverage the village social
solidarity committees (VSSCs) to help mobilize financial support if needed. Both changes
promoted sustainability of access to health care and support by enabling participants to
rely on these mechanisms after the program ended and without BRAC’s support.
Factored in localized area contextualization. BRAC factored regional contextual
differences among its target locations into slight program adjustments. For ­example,
a third of program sites are located in regions affected by climate change. In those
regions, adaptations include alternative livelihood options, awareness-raising on
­disaster preparedness, and support to make homes and shelters more resilient.

Scale and adaptation through leveraging investments in infrastructure,
staff, and learning
BRAC has reached more than 100 million people in Bangladesh through a systematic
effort to scale up and leverage its investments in infrastructure, staff, insights, and
learning from earlier and existing programs. BRAC is recognized for both its horizontal
and functional scale and for implementing expansive programs in microfinance, education, health, human rights and legal empowerment, and disaster preparedness, which
address the multidimensional aspects of poverty. Over the years, the organization has
expanded to over 2,000 branch offices covering all 64 districts of the country.
BRAC’s initial scale nationwide is attributed to community mobilization efforts
related to the health care work it undertook in the 1980s as it trained households on
how to mix oral rehydration solution. These community mobilization efforts were
leveraged to offer microfinance for poor women in rural communities, thereby creating
a demand for a network of branches and staff infrastructure that would later be used
to offer additional development services, including livelihoods training, human rights
awareness-raising and local advocacy, WASH, and other health programs. Outside of
Bangladesh, BRAC has largely continued a similar trajectory of using microfinance to
develop a presence, layering other development programs alongside it. For ­example,
in Uganda, where BRAC has its largest presence outside of Bangladesh, it serves
208,000 microfinance clients and offers additional development programs in 100 of its
160 branches.
In the graduation and other programs, continuous feedback loops ensured that
field insights informed management decisions. The richest insights on program effectiveness from field staff are systematically fed up to management. Regional managers, who spend three weeks a month in the field and one week a month in the head
office in Dhaka, collect observations from program officers from across branch locations and identify patterns to be considered or addressed by management in charge
of operations. This mechanism for learning was critical to understanding how participants were responding to the program changes. For example, in 2017 anecdotes from
program officers, who work directly with households, suggested that a third of eligible households whom the program had classified as being in the “better-off” category
of households and therefore were expected to repay the full value of the asset were
self-excluding from the program. The program’s monitoring and evaluation department verified that the self-exclusion rate of eligible households was roughly 30 percent.
217

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

Researchers identified the main reason for this finding: this group felt that the expectation that they would repay the full amount while others paid less than half was unfair,
and so they did not want to participate. Thus before scaling back up to 100,000 households in 2018, management brought the repayment expectation down to 80 percent of
the asset value, which, among other factors, led to a reduction in self-exclusion rates.
To test the design before a full-scale implementation, BRAC cut its normal graduation program intake by over half, enabling staff to learn by doing, with half directly
­implementing and sharing knowledge and implementation suggestions with others
before BRAC expanded.
The scaled-up nature of BRAC’s program implies that large-scale organizational
shifts are often required to successfully operationalize programmatic shifts. For example, in spite of a strong staff implementation capacity, recent graduation program
changes required a shift in the mindset and skills of field staff, many of whom had
been implementing the program for more than a decade. To ensure a continued organizational capacity for the program at scale, all field implementation staff received
an in-depth orientation around the changes and the rationale behind them, helping
to build buy-in. In particular, the program’s new emphasis on building participants’
capacity to pay installments meant all staff had to be skilled in supporting careful
financial planning, monitoring spending, and assessing business plans. To increase
­efficiency and reduce costs, BRAC streamlined its field management structures, increasing the number of regions and districts under each regional manager. Recognizing the
organizational lift required to achieve these programmatic changes at scale, BRAC led
an inclusive change management process. From the beginning, the redesign process
was enriched by cross-program learning from field officers, management, and research
staff involved in consultations, market assessments, design workshops, and program
design prototyping. The phased rollout was launched in 2017. All staff were subsequently engaged in assessing the effectiveness of the new design.
BRAC’s efforts in graduation have also pivoted toward a new dimension of scale—
supporting governments in implementing their own programs through policy ­advocacy
and technical assistance. BRAC recognized that the global magnitude of extreme
poverty demanded government-scale programs and that NGOs could do much to
support the launch of such programs. Since 2014, BRAC has explored a new modality for scaling the graduation approach by supporting the adoption, implementation,
and scale-up of graduation programs by governments through advocacy and in-depth
­technical assistance. To date, it has worked with the governments of Afghanistan,
Guinea, Kenya, Lesotho, Pakistan, the Philippines, Rwanda, and Tamil Nadu (India).

Lessons
The revised program is undergoing a quasi-experimental evaluation to assess the
impacts of the redesigned program, and end-line surveys were being conducted at the
time of this writing. However, because the characteristics of target groups vary between
pre- and post-2017 cohorts, the impacts of the two program designs will not be directly
comparable. This section outlines the pertinent lessons for graduation and economic
inclusion programs at the programmatic level on how to enable effective adaptation
and scale.

Effective adaptation
BRAC’s iterative approach to the evolution of its program has been supported by longterm investment with flexible terms. BRAC’s program benefited from the stability of a
218

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

long-standing funding instrument with DFID and DFAT. This arrangement gave BRAC
the flexibility to adapt and adjust the program because it was held accountable for
outcomes and not for specific program design expectations.
Graduation should be viewed as an adaptive methodology aimed at facilitating
key outcomes for the poorest, not as a rigid program model. The understanding that
graduation is a set of principles rather than a set of fixed components gave BRAC the
creative freedom to make the adjustments demanded by the context, regardless of what
had been proved to work previously. Its focus on the needs of the poorest and intended
outcomes enabled BRAC to ensure fidelity to the original program’s ability to generate
sustainable outcomes for the poorest while providing plenty of room for adaptation to
the new context. BRAC has continued to apply this approach to other vulnerabilities
and pockets of extreme poverty in Bangladesh, such as adaptations for persons with
disabilities, refugee host communities, and urban communities, as well as for other
NGOs and governments outside of Bangladesh.
Because the contexts of poverty invariably change, graduation programming can
add value to a tapestry of antipoverty interventions by maintaining a focus on helping
the poorest achieve a basic standard of living through a multidisciplinary approach—
one that activates households’ latent economic potential. As contexts develop, it can
become even harder for the poorest population to keep pace. Graduation programs
have a role to play in ensuring the poor’s access to opportunities to address their most
salient issues. For example, although a variety of SSNs and health services had become
available to the poorest, many needed help to access them.
BRAC has sought to be intentional in seeking out the poorest, and it recognizes
the changing contexts of poverty mean that the indicators used to identify the extreme
poor must be continually reevaluated, in addition to the interventions most appropriate to building social and economic empowerment and financial inclusion outcomes for
this population. The poorest are often the most marginalized, and typically they require
proactive targeting and identification so they are not left behind. Programs must also
be intentional about addressing heterogeneity among the poorest in order to maximize
cost-effectiveness and program outcomes. For BRAC, this meant understanding distinctions between women considered to be of “working age” versus women who were
older with a limited capacity to engage in income-generating activities. Understanding
these distinctions can help inform how certain interventions may be more or less
impactful and cost-effective. For example, although older women still needed some
level of livelihood support from BRAC, they were less likely to invest in livelihoods,
would gradually become less productive, and thus would benefit more from receiving
additional support via government SSNs. BRAC therefore intentionally shifted toward
allotting a greater portion of programming resources to building the livelihoods of
women under age 50.
Continuous learning and evaluation have proved integral to achieving impact at
scale. Such a process goes beyond inviting external researchers to conduct evaluations
at the end of an implementation period. The use of a range of research, monitoring and
evaluation in development, scale-up, adaptation, and implementation measures ensures
that insights, questions, or issues about the program’s effectiveness can be addressed
quickly and efficiently. BRAC credits its ability to achieve a highly impactful program at
scale to the deeply embedded role that research and learning had in the development
and continued adaptation of the program. Large-scale programs in return create robust
opportunities for learning by offering large data sets from which BRAC can more easily
identify patterns and understand heterogeneous effects more clearly.
BRAC’s field implementation staff have been critical stakeholders in change
management. BRAC’s evolution of the graduation program has relied heavily on
enabling and empowering staff operating at the grassroots to inform decision-making at the highest levels. Feedback loops from the front lines are vital to ensuring that
219

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

learning and observation are incorporated into senior-level decision-making on program
design, adaptation, and operations.
The coaching component of graduation can be a critical element in moving the
program in new directions. Coaching is a vital mechanism for monitoring how participants are responding to particular program elements. For example, when BRAC introduced all of its participants to partial loan repayments, the value of individual coaching
was reinforced as a mechanism for mitigating risk and easing participants into the new
demands on their abilities.
Some participants can contribute to the costs of the program. Where this option is
explored, programs must conduct rigorous market assessments to indicate whether livelihoods will generate sufficient returns for participants to pay regular installments and
earn a profit. Meanwhile, managers must consider participants’ financial capacity to
repay loans, and, if repayments are expected of participants, the program must dedicate
resources to building financial literacy and skills, building in protections, and carefully
monitoring and supporting participants.

Scale
Programs should seek cost efficiencies by leveraging existing structures and services.
In fact, all graduation and economic inclusion programs should review the constellation
of available services and structures for possible leverage and should design interventions to fill these gaps. Such an effort would promote functional scale by layering on
what is available, as well as horizontal scale by identifying cost efficiencies. These efficiencies do not need to be internal to the implementing organization. Although BRAC
was able to leverage its own microfinance branch network to scale up the graduation
program across Bangladesh, it also took advantage of the ability to link participants to
available government SSNs and health care services. Geographic coverage should be
driven by where there is the greatest need. Although BRAC maintained the same intake
of households, it reduced the geographic scale of the program to focus on areas with
the greatest concentrations of extreme poverty. This principle should be maintained,
especially where resources limit the ability to scale up nationwide.
For BRAC, an intentional shift toward supporting governments to scale up their
own graduation programs implies new learning and innovation and exploring new
arrangements for implementation and contexts suitable for graduation. Through its
work with governments in different contexts, BRAC has explored a variety of implementing arrangements, from direct government implementation to government–NGO
partnerships, seeking to understand which operational approaches apply best in which
settings or circumstances. Specifically, BRAC has been exploring how the graduation
approach can be adapted to refugee settlements and host communities, urban resettled populations, fragile contexts, violence- and conflict-affected communities, and
people with disabilities. BRAC is also seeking to address questions of cost-effectiveness
by exploring opportunities to layer onto existing government schemes, such as cash
­transfers, public works programs, and other livelihood schemes.
BRAC’s work implicitly leverages funds that governments and multilateral donors
already dedicate to social protection programming. Instead of seeking additional
funds to set up new programs, BRAC has found that graduation provides a framework
through which existing government programs and measures can be converged, and
therefore resources can be leveraged. This convergence also reveals opportunities for
interministerial collaboration and cost-sharing among, for example, ministries of agriculture, trade, and industry and small business or labor, where existing programs can
be adapted and leveraged to serve the most vulnerable as part of a holistic approach to
alleviating extreme poverty on a national level.

CASE STUDY 4

Haku Wiñay: An Economic Inclusion
Program in Peru
Introduction
Against a backdrop of intense social, political, and economic transformation in its
rural areas over the last decades, Peru introduced Haku Wiñay, an economic i­nclusion
program aimed at creating economic gains among the most disadvantaged rural
­households. The intervention, implemented by the Ministry of Development and
Social Inclusion (MIDIS), draws on both new and traditional methodologies, relying on
participatory decision-making by organized households, community-level trainers, and
community structures.
At its core, Haku Wiñay is characterized by (1) flexibility to adapt the intervention
to the productive, social, and cultural dynamics of each rural territory; (2) empowerment of the participating households that play a key role in implementing the local
design of the intervention; and (3) recapture of the lessons learned from previous
­interventions in order to scale them up.
To implement Haku Wiñay, MIDIS relies on the Social Development Cooperation
Fund (Foncodes). An agency of the Peruvian government created in 1991, Foncodes
was part of a generation of demand-driven rural development programs promoted by
several cooperation agencies at the time. Since then, Foncodes has become an important and innovative rural development actor (Asensio 2019) that has been attached to
various ministries and, since 2011, has been part of MIDIS. Foncodes is in charge of
implementing Haku Wiñay, applying its personnel, methodologies, and experience to
the benefit of the program.
Haku Wiñay is primarily a livelihoods intervention that overlaps significantly
with Peru’s predominant cash transfer program, Juntos. Introduced in 2006, Juntos
provides mothers in poor households with a bimonthly payment in exchange for fulfilling a series of conditions relative to their underage children’s education, nutrition, and
health. Although Juntos is thought to be an important approach to social protection,
­questions remained about how to sustain economic inclusion of households when their
children aged out of eligibility for the program.
Haku Wiñay employs this theory of change: improving the economic inclusion of
the rural poor is possible by strengthening a virtuous circle among productive improvements, home improvements, income generation, and market access through capacity
development, asset enhancement, and promotion of economic opportunities. The intervention has aimed to simultaneously increase households’ income and improve their
food security, resulting in expanded economic inclusion of the rural population and
greater resilience once the cycle of conditional transfers of the Juntos program ends for
a family when its children age out of eligibility. Initially, Haku Wiñay and Juntos were
envisioned as complementary—that is, the programs would generate a path for families
receiving the conditional transfer to continue to receive support once their children had
become ineligible for Juntos. In practice, efforts to limit Haku Wiñay to Juntos participants proved to be infeasible, and now Haku Wiñay operates even in areas where
Juntos does not.
This study was authored by Raúl Asensio, Instituto de Estudios Peruanos.

This case study provides insights into how economic inclusion programs
can leverage proven and accepted community structures and integrate them in a
national program strategy with a view toward replication and scale-up. Participatory
­decision-making and the engagement of community project management systems
and community trainers (yachachiqs) have helped Haku Wiñay scale up its work.
Replication in certain contexts has required significant adaptations, as well as giving
implementers the freedom to apply locally relevant microstrategies that take into
account the various contexts of rural poverty found in Peru.

Context
Inequality has characterized Peru’s growth story. Poverty in Peru dropped from
58.7 percent in 2004 to 20.5 percent in 2018. This decrease was among the most prominent in Latin America, but it also coincided with an increasing disparity between rural
territories—that is, between those that had successfully connected to economic growth
dynamics and those that had remained (and remain) at the margins. Widening gaps have
also been evident between those households that have successfully engaged in growth
dynamics by diversifying their incomes and those that have been challenged to do so.
Recent growth in Peru has also coincided with intense social, political, and
economic transformations. The country is urbanizing rapidly, moving away from being
a primarily rural economy. As a result, effective territorial management and integration
between the capital, Lima, and the large and intermediate cities have become challenging. Lima remains highly populated compared with the rest of the country and contains
the largest concentration of the country’s wealth and human capital. Even so, the country has seen significant improvements in recent decades. Expanded public services,
new road construction, stronger local governments, diversification of economic activities, and the rise to power of mayors with rural farming and peasant backgrounds have
all helped to address the challenges. However, these developments have coincided with
a surge in conflicts linked to the management of natural resources and the use of public
funds, as well as with poverty rates that remain significantly higher in rural areas than
in urban areas.
Although challenges remain, in the last few years significant changes have
affected the economic and social dynamics in rural areas. Positive trends are evident
in ­educational achievement and the empowerment of women, both through schooling
and through improved access to control over agricultural holdings, and advances in
infrastructure and rural connectivity are being made as well. Overall, a dependence on
farming activities is declining because these activities are being replaced by paid work
and employment in the services sector.
The Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion emerged during the first months
of President Ollanta Humala’s administration as part of an effort to reorganize the
country’s social protection and inclusion policies, grouping them under the leadership
of a single ministry. MIDIS is founded on the human development approach, and so it
is committed to activating and multiplying the potential of low-income families. It has
aspired to become the axis of social policy for the Peruvian state through a comprehensive life cycle approach that addresses the different stages of life of the most disadvantaged populations and a multidimensional approach to well-being. MIDIS’s short-term
strategies included providing direct assistance programs to enable households to access
basic resources.
In both the medium and long term, MIDIS has sought to provide conditions for
families so that they themselves can undertake the social and economic strengthening
that would allow a break in intergenerational poverty. In doing so, MIDIS has assumed

223

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

two responsibilities, which in other countries may correspond to two ministries: (1) it
coordinates and ensures the implementation of social policy among sectors and levels
of government; and (2) it implements the most important social safety net interventions, including the conditional cash transfer program (Juntos) and the school feeding
program (Qali Warma).

Haku Wiñay coverage, targeting, implementation,
and cost
Haku Wiñay owes its creation to the confluence of three factors. First, a window
of political opportunity opened during the first years of the Humala administration, making it possible to design a new style of social program with an emphasis on
productive inclusion. Second, a community of academics, experts, and practitioners
emerged who focused on development policy, extracted lessons, and proposed new
economic inclusion initiatives. And, third, there had been a long-standing tradition of
economic development and inclusion interventions in Andean rural areas—one that
had generated knowledge that accumulated in public institutions, among nongovernmental ­organizations (NGOs), and among rural households that interacted with social
programs and development interventions.
Social inclusion interventions in Peru developed considerably during the 1990s,
when a series of demand-driven programs, supported by international aid and technical assistance, were introduced. Programs such as Foncodes and the National Program
for the Management of Water Basins and Land Conservation (Pronamachs) were early
efforts that bore lessons for Haku Wiñay, as were the experiences of several Peruvian
NGOs and international cooperation programs, including the Puno-Cusco Corridor
Program developed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).
These programs helped to overcome the economic challenges faced by rural Peruvians
during the 1990s and contributed to a decline in rural poverty in the first decade of the
21st century.
By 2010, however, a growing consensus among academics and policy makers was
that these interventions were insufficient to tackle persistent rural poverty. A new
­strategy was needed—one that would draw on prior lessons and leverage the strength
of the growing Peruvian economy. Haku Wiñay was envisioned as an approach that
would leverage the experience and lessons of the past to create an innovative program
tailored to the new economic context of Peru’s rural areas.
Haku Wiñay was launched in 2014, building on the lessons of a pilot program, Mi
Chacra Productiva, launched two years earlier. Haku Wiñay’s objective was to provide
rural households with the tools they needed to take advantage of new opportunities
arising from the dynamics of economic growth through the improvement and diversification of agricultural production and rural market access. Haku Wiñay was conceived
as a time-bound intervention consisting of four components over a three-year period.
Each household remains in the program for a maximum of three years, divided into
three stages:
•• Stage 1, implementation, covering components 1 and 2 of the program
•• Stage 2, appropriation, covering component 3
•• Stage 3, consolidation, covering component 4
These components and the accompanying productive assets and technologies are
outlined in more detail in box CS4.1.

BOX CS4.1 H
 aku Wiñay’s Components and Accompanying Productive Assets and
Technologies
Component 1: Strengthening and consolidating rural family production systems
Each home receives two to four visits each month from a local operator, known as
the productive yachachiq, who provides individualized technical assistance, training,
and productive assets. The primary goal is to help households implement productive
assets and technologies and to train households in their use. The productive assets and
technologies offered vary according to the local area and market dynamics. They can
include small irrigation systems at the household level, open field vegetable gardens
and rustic greenhouses, cultivation of associated pastures, smaller animal breeding
management (guinea pigs, hens, sheep), improvement of Andean crops (grains and
tubers), management of cocoa and coffee cultivation in mountain areas, and other
productive investments with local impacts (such as barns for alpacas, beekeeping, miniparcels for producing rice, and cochas for aquaculture and fish processing).
Component 2: Improvements for healthy homes
Technical assistance from the productive yachachiqs also focuses on home improvements such as installing better stoves and appropriate safe water and solid waste
disposal systems. The productive assets and technologies offered include improved
kitchens, safe water, solid waste management, and other improvements in the home’s
organization and health (such as separation of spaces). This component also includes
assistance and guidance on healthy practices, which are coordinated with local health
establishments.
Component 3: Promotion of inclusive rural businesses
Groups of households work together to prepare a business profile to be publicly
supported by CLAR (Local Committee for the Allocation of Resources) through a
­business plan competition. The executing nuclei (groups of 80–100 rural households created ad hoc for implementation of the project) provide winning groups with
­specialized technical assistance (assets and services) according to the type of business.
These services are offered by technicians and professionals, including the financial
yachachiqs (see component 4).
Component 4: Capacity building, providing training in financial literacy,
and promoting savings
All households participating in Haku Wiñay receive training in simple financial
­operations. This training is carried out by specialists, financial yachachiqs (not the
productive yachachiqs). Often the training is carried out jointly with the Juntos program.
Component 3 business groups can also receive more complex training in the financing
of inclusive businesses.

Current coverage
As of April 2020, over 246,000 households had received support from Haku Wiñay,
including the some 115,000 homes where the Haku Wiñay cycle of intervention has
concluded. These numbers represent a significant scale-up in coverage in the Peruvian
context. According to the current targeting criteria, it is estimated that Haku Wiñay
has reached approximately 47 percent of homes that could potentially fulfill the
requirements to participate in the intervention.
225

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

To scale up, Haku Wiñay has followed an incremental approach to deploying
efforts in new territories. Progressively, new departments have been incorporated,
and coverage has been extended to other regions throughout the country. From the
southern highlands to the northern highlands and the jungle, Haku Wiñay is present
today in all of the country’s regions, except for the department of Tumbes, where the
target population is not significant in number. In 2013 Haku Wiñay expanded to the
­departments of the Peruvian jungle. In this region, the program is called Noa Jayatai
(“We are going to grow” in the Shipibo language). The operating scheme is similar and
includes the same four components, although with some adaptations to respond to the
social and economic contexts of the jungle regions. Similarly, productive technologies
and home improvements are also adapted to the local cultural context.

Targeting
Beneficiaries are able to self-select into the program in predetermined program implementation areas. These areas are selected based on a high incidence of rural poverty
and with a view toward minimizing potential discord. The central criterion for selecting
areas of intervention has become the predominance within each community of homes
with subsistence economies. To define this in operational terms, Haku Wiñay looks
at farmland utilization as an indicator. Subsistence economy is defined as a household
with a property of less than 1.3 hectares (the median size of national plots, according
to the agricultural census of 2012). In addition to this central criterion, as of 2020 Haku
Wiñay beneficiaries are characterized by the use of 75 percent or more of available
household labor for agricultural activities; the use of 75 percent or more of property for
agricultural purposes; and simultaneously, limited sales and market value of agricultural production.
Although Haku Wiñay households overlap significantly with Juntos recipients,
engagement in Juntos is no longer an explicit inclusion criterion for Haku Wiñay. Other
guidelines for the selection of implementation areas include location in districts with
over 40 percent of households living in poverty; in priority districts for the reduction of
chronic child malnutrition; in areas with at least 40 households; and in areas in which
60 percent or more of households exhibit at least one unmet basic need.

Implementation
Implementation of Haku Wiñay relies on oversight by government agencies and the
participation and support of households and communities. As noted, the program is
overseen by Foncodes, an agency within MIDIS that is staffed primarily by both agricultural science professionals and social science professionals. Increasingly, Foncodes and
MIDIS are leveraging the rise of a new generation of professionals who have farming
and peasant backgrounds and who have benefited from university training. They can
therefore leverage both training and a deep knowledge of local culture and practice.
Haku Wiñay is implemented with the support of its so-called executing nuclei. The
concept of executing nuclei as an avenue for program delivery was inherited by Haku
Wiñay from previous Foncodes interventions. Executing nuclei are groups of 80–100
rural households created ad hoc for implementation of the project. Each nucleus has
a board of directors whose members have been selected by the beneficiaries or users
of the intervention. The executing nuclei are in charge of the funds received to finance
Haku Wiñay activities and pay the yachachiqs. The nuclei have communal legitimacy
because they are integrated and directed by members of the community, and they are
not involved in determining who participates in the program—the program is open to
226

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

all households in the selected areas. They also create bureaucratic efficiency because
of their ability to receive and manage funds from the public budget, authorized by a
special rule established when Foncodes was founded. Executing nuclei are supervised
and supported by local Haku Wiñay offices, which also approve their formation.
For the front-line delivery of technical assistance and training to households,
Haku Wiñay relies on the farmer-to-farmer training model, based on the figure of the
­yachachiq (or trainer). Meaning “the one who knows” in the Quechua language, the
yachachiq is a local expert hired to train his or her neighbors or households in nearby
communities. Yachachiqs, selected through a public contest held by the Foncodes
regional office, are largely responsible for the delivery of Haku Wiñay components
1 and 2, with the support of the professionals who work in Foncodes’s regional offices.
One of the advantages of engaging yachachiqs, in addition to their knowledge of the
local language, is that they are embedded in the communities’ sociocultural dynamics and therefore have privileged insight into their area and into the characteristics and
needs of rural families. The use of yachachiqs has worked well in regions where there
is already a critical mass of peasants with experience of working with social programs
and NGOs. By contrast, it has been more challenging in areas where the concept of
yachachiqs is more nascent.
When deciding how the program will be implemented in their communities,
Haku Wiñay households have ample margin for autonomy. The first two intervention
components (technology transfer for improving the farm and the home) are designed
in such a way that each community can adapt them to their own particular social and
economic dynamics.

Productive assets and technologies transferred to households
Haku Wiñay offers users a menu of potential productive assets and technologies to be
transferred, as well as a menu of home improvements. Each community must select
from both the technology and home improvement menus which improvements it will
implement, up to a limit of $1,700 per household. This selection is made collectively
at the executing nucleus level through a community diagnostic workshop held prior
to the intervention itself. The technologies included in the menu have been validated
as ­operational and sustainable in contexts of low resources (for additional detail
on the various productive assets and technologies, see box CS4.1). To implement
these technologies, participants count on guidance from Haku Wiñay and, in some
cases, from other state institutions that deliver certain supplies or assist in training
or logistics issues. As participants in the intervention, households are required to
help with the installation of these technologies (as unpaid labor) and commit to their
sustainability.

Promoting market access through inclusive rural business groups
and competitions
To further improve the population’s income, Haku Wiñay encourages the development
of inclusive businesses and facilitates market links. Inclusive business group participants are chosen through competitions carried out at the end of the second year of the
intervention. Inclusive business groups consist of three to five Haku Wiñay recipients
seeking to carry out common productive activities, or the commercialization of agricultural products, or both. The winning groups receive special training and support
to launch their activities during the third year of the intervention. The most common
inclusive businesses are textiles and ceramic crafts, bakery and gastronomy, rural
227

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

tourism, dairy products and by-products, small animal rearing for sale, fish farming,
and cattle fattening.
To further develop their businesses, the winning groups rely on Foncodes’s support
for resources, advice, and efforts to establish active market links. Support of these rural
inclusive business groups stimulates small business opportunities, which may mean
pursuing transactions with provincial capitals and previously inaccessible markets. In
addition, Haku Wiñay, either directly or in collaboration with municipalities, encourages small-scale opportunities for trade, such as weekly fairs or festivals targeting a
certain product. In such venues, participants can sell their products in an environment
less daunting than that found in traditional markets.

Funding and costs
The activities of Haku Wiñay are funded by the government as a budgetary line item,
replenished on an annual basis. The Haku Wiñay intervention costs roughly $1,700 per
household across three years of the intervention. Figures CS4.1 and CS4.2 show the
intervention’s evolution and the budgetary investment. Between 2012 and 2018, Haku
Wiñay received 1,031 million nuevos soles from the Peruvian government (approximately $310 million).

Impacts and results
Haku Wiñay has been the subject of several studies and evaluations that speak to the
program’s operations, results, and impact. The most important quantitative evaluation
was carried out by Escobal and Ponce (2016), although it was conducted at an early
stage of the development of Haku Wiñay and in a limited number of regions. This evaluation found an average increase of 7.8 percent in the incomes of the households in the

program compared with the households in the control group (Escobal and Ponce 2016).
These increases, which mainly affected households that participated in component 3
(inclusive businesses), were accompanied by a change in income generation strategies:
the percentage of income from independent work or work based on self-employment
increased, while the percentage of income from dependent work, including agricultural labor for others, decreased, indicating that households were now more autonomous. From a subjective point of view, 67 percent of households perceived their own
income to be higher than before the intervention. In food security, the evaluation found
statistically significant changes in the production of vegetables and greens, as well
as in the number of chickens, guinea pigs, and eggs produced. Subsequent qualitative studies have shown results along the same lines—that is, a significant but limited
impact on income and a greater impact on food security (Díez Hurtado and Correa Aste
2016). A pending new quantitative evaluation is intended to study the evolution of the
program in recent years in a greater number of regions, including jungle departments.
Almost all studies of Haku Wiñay point to a heterogeneity of results and outcomes.
Differences are associated both with each household’s participation in the program
and with the characteristics of the territories where the intervention is being carried
out. At the territorial level, studies such as that by Asensio, Fernández, and Burneo
(2016) have found that the level economic dynamism of each territory correlates with
the success experienced by families. In rural areas with relatively dynamic markets,
the Haku Wiñay interventions enable families to access productive assets to take
better advantage of these dynamics. In areas with less dynamism, the results are more
limited. At the participant level, studies show that individual dispositions and household characteristics, including the relative economic condition of the household and
levels of interest in engaging in the program play a role in levels of success (Escobal
and Ponce 2016). Further studies are expected to examine factors such as how the
program could be influenced by psychological variables, including perceptions of
what can be achieved on the farm and perceived control over life events (Aldana et al.
2018). See box CS4.2 for a discussion on the gender-related dimensions of Haku
Wiñay programming.

BOX CS4.2

Gender Dimensions of Haku Wiñay

The design of Haku Wiñay does not include an explicit gender-based approach.
Nevertheless, the program may, as implemented, facilitate more progressive perceptions of women’s roles that go beyond those assigned by traditional gender systems,
and facilitate the inclusion of women in community decision-making opportunities, such
as in the executing nuclei. In these meetings, women may acquire skills and abilities
that they later may put to use in other areas of community life, although this was not an
explicit goal of Haku Wiñay.
Women’s participation is noteworthy in the productive business component, but it is
hard to quantify with precision. Their increased participation may stem from the fact that
these businesses often focus on new areas of family productive activity. Generally, in
Andean areas the prevailing division of labor sees men tending to work in consolidated
businesses, whereas women work in new businesses.
Women’s participation in Haku Wiñay’s activities may be more intense in areas with
higher economic dynamism and more limited in areas with lower economic dynamism. This difference results from the higher opportunity costs of areas with greater
economic dynamism, leading men to prefer activities they consider to be potentially
more lucrative. If so, men are more likely to delegate participation in meetings and training sessions to their wives as assigned users or “in representation” of their husbands.
In less dynamic areas, the opportunity costs are lower, and frequently men are still in
charge of representing their households.
Díez Hurtado and Correa Aste (2018) find that women in communities participating in
Haku Wiñay have a larger number of businesses and report greater satisfaction with
their lives and achievements. However, the authors also find scarce to no impact in
socioemotional indicators such as self-esteem, persistence, or ambition, or in indicators
related to decision-making in the home.

Moving to scale by institutionalizing lessons and
community structures
Haku Wiñay emerged from a desire among government officials to create a path for the
economic inclusion of the rural population, to enable the poor to leverage the rising
economic dynamism of Peru. In the context of the human development perspective
adopted by MIDIS with its commitment to activating and multiplying the potential of
low-income families, an initial diagnosis of the poverty traps of Peru’s rural households revealed three interrelated factors: untapped human capital, low productivity,
and lack of access to markets (Trivelli and Vargas Winstanley 2014). To address these
­challenges, the design of the intervention included the following strategic commitments: (1) to empower users to decide the concrete ways in which the program was to
be implemented in their communities; (2) to go back to and expand the characteristics
of previous successful interventions; and (3) to adopt strategic and tactical flexibility to
collectively face emerging problems and ensure implementation of the intervention.
The government of Peru has implemented Haku Wiñay by leveraging previous lessons on what works in the Peruvian Andean context, in particular the value
230

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

of community-based trainers. Yachachiqs are common figures in rural development
and economic interventions carried out in the Peruvian Andes (Asensio 2016). They
emerged in the 1980s as part of international development efforts to generate culturally relevant intervention models—that is, interventions adapted to Andean social and
cultural dynamics. Since these early experiences, yachachiqs have been utilized by
many other rural development interventions (run by NGOs and by the Peruvian government) to the point that they are now a standard mechanism of development interventions in the country’s southern highlands. Haku Wiñay also relies on these individuals,
and it has extended their work to regions where they had not previously operated. To
carry out their work, yachachiqs receive training from specialists in the regional office,
and in turn they are responsible for training participants and households. During the
last few years, financial yachachiqs have emerged. They advise participants on the
inclusive business and financial issues included in the program’s fourth component.
The government of Peru has also effectively institutionalized the implementation
of Haku Wiñay through the executing nuclei. Executing nuclei are not a Haku Wiñay
innovation but rather an adaptation of a preexisting concept (Asensio 2019). They
were created in the 1990s by the Peruvian government to facilitate the implementation of demand-driven programs. Special legislation established from the inception of
the executing nuclei program allows them to directly receive funds from the Peruvian
government, even when they do not have the legal status usually required. They can
make financial, legal, and administrative decisions on developing business plans,
opening bank accounts, hiring professionals, buying supplies, and receiving contributions from the community (such as donations of unskilled labor) and local governments. Each executing nuclei has a board consisting of four representatives elected by
a general assembly in which all user households participate. They fill the positions of
president, secretary, treasurer, and prosecutor. In addition to the executing nuclei, the
program is further institutionalized by the Central Executing Nuclei (NEC), which channels Foncodes’s resources at the district or provincial levels.

Moving to scale up through programmatic adaptations, targeting
practices, and localized microstrategies
Several programmatic adaptations and adjustments have marked Haku Wiñay’s
successful scale-up. The Haku Wiñay pilot program was launched in June 2012 in
two districts of the department of Ayacucho in the Andean region—one of the poorest
departments in the country. The 1,683 households participating in the pilot program
also participated in Juntos because initially Haku Wiñay and Juntos were intended
to complement one another so that families receiving the conditional transfer would
continue to receive government support once their children had aged out of Juntos.
In practice, limiting the Haku Wiñay intervention to recipients of the Juntos cash
transfer proved impractical and detrimental, and so, as noted earlier, it was changed.
The wide dispersion of the homes that received conditional transfers worked against
the territorial logic of Haku Wiñay’s design because it made it difficult to integrate the
executing nuclei and the work of yachachiqs. Meanwhile, “negative narratives” quickly
emerged among the rural populations, such as Haku Wiñay’s purpose was to “replace”
Juntos. Because Juntos was highly regarded by the rural population, these narratives
fostered anxiety about Haku Wiñay. As a result, many potential participants refused
to engage in the intervention, or they abandoned it during implementation of the
pilot program. Households excluded from Haku Wiñay because they were not part of
Juntos felt unfairly treated because they considered themselves to be “as poor” as their
neighbors who had been included in the intervention. They felt that, in addition to the
“injustice” of not receiving Juntos, they now faced the injustice of being unable to join
231

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

Haku Wiñay. These factors created an environment of suspicion and misunderstandings
around Haku Wiñay, and so the notion of including only Juntos beneficiary households
was abandoned.
In fact, Haku Wiñay realized that including better-off households in the community in the program would be a driver of successful livelihoods and income-­generating
­activities. Better-off households likely already had some ongoing business, had
commercial links, knew about local value chains, and could help shore up a critical
volume of economic activity to allow buyers and input providers, such as veterinary
support, to engage in business in poor towns.
In the end, the targeting practices allowed the entry of participants from Juntos
areas, and not just Juntos-recipient households. Participating communities were
selected on the basis of the presence of Juntos, but once communities were selected,
participation in Haku Wiñay was open to all households wishing to be part of the
program, regardless of whether they participated in Juntos. This solution—using Juntos
as a proxy for identifying poor communities—prevented the problems stemming from
microtargeting at the household level, which could in turn result in conflict between
neighbors and accusations of favoritism. The approach also allowed Haku Wiñay to
avoid being seen as a “substitute” for Juntos.
Subsequently, since 2017 the presence of Juntos has not been a central criterion in the
selection of the communities where Haku Wiñay intervenes. Instead, the central criterion
has become the predominance of homes with subsistence economies within each community (Apoyo Consulting 2018). Programmatically, this revision may ­present some drawbacks as well. The presence of Juntos is likely key to ensuring a minimal level of cash and
consumption support for the poorest households, although this has not been definitively
confirmed by an assessment of the real impact of an overlap with Juntos.
Tactical flexibility and the adaptation of microstrategies that local program implementers use to take into account the various rural contexts, have allowed Haku Wiñay
to succeed and scale up in the widely varying regional and cultural contexts of Peru.
Haku Wiñay provides those implementing the intervention in the field with significant
operational autonomy and the ability to modify microstrategies (Asensio, Fernández,
and Burneo 2016). These microstrategies are informed by localized experience and
allow adjustments as the program is developed in each community. For example, in
communities where men migrate seasonally or have other occupations, training activities are carried out with their wives, regardless of whether they are the intervention’s
“official” users. Other microstrategies include the use of small raffles to encourage
participation in certain activities, or informal agreements with municipal officials to
facilitate the use of machines or collective transportation vehicles, or the organization of fairs and festivals where the population can sell their products. This latitude for
decision-making at the margins is considered essential to adapt to each community’s
unique characteristics and its economic and social dynamics.
In practice, Haku Wiñay, like most social programs, is a centrally designed intervention, but one that takes shape in the field through locally relevant implementation
and inputs to households. Flexibility allows the intervention to be adapted locally and
prevents the program from collapsing in the complicated universe of Andean communal
micropolitics. The result is an intervention that evokes relatively low levels of conflict
compared with other initiatives developed by MIDIS, such as Qali Warma, the national
school feeding program, or Juntos.

Lessons
At present, Haku Wiñay has reached more than 246,000 households nationwide. It is
well regarded by most of the population and has some noteworthy achievements,
232

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

including higher agricultural production, improvements in the household conditions
of rural families, and improvements in food security. Its experience with the economic
inclusion of Peru’s rural poor bears lessons for the field of economic inclusion at large.

Institutional lessons
Haku Wiñay leverages the know-how accumulated by previous development
­interventions as well as by Peruvian local populations, and it has effectively institutionalized these elements. Key community structures and established practices, including
­yachachiqs, “farmer to farmer” methodologies, executing nuclei, and business competitions, resulted from these previous experiences and have helped to position Haku
Wiñay for success. A culture that values innovation and learning has been strengthened, focusing on testing innovations via different projects, which are then subject
to evaluation or debate by academia, international agencies, and private actors. The
process has benefited Peru’s development landscape and Haku Wiñay as a program.
Successful implementation of Haku Wiñay requires that implementers be sensitive and responsive to the heterogeneous and changing dynamics of the country’s rural
contexts. The skills required go beyond just technical and professional c­ apabilities.
In the years to come, Haku Wiñay and other economic inclusion interventions in
Peru will likely need to select and retain personnel with the characteristics and skill
sets needed to work in rural contexts that require flexibility and a capacity to make
­decisions on the ground. The scale-up of Haku Wiñay to date is due, at least in part,
to having utilized a new generation of professionals who are from the same regions
in which the program is being implemented, and so they are familiar with the local
and cultural contexts. Some are also specialized in the relevant technical areas or
in social development and have benefited from university training, which has given
them the technical know-how and deep knowledge of social dynamics needed for such
a program.
Investing in strengthening specific features of government institutional cultures is
important. Scaling up economic inclusion in Peru will require institutional cultures that
promote and encourage local flexibility and capabilities. It will also require institutional
cultures that favor the creation of interdisciplinary teams so that knowledge in various
disciplines and skills can be combined when adapting interventions to conflict-affected,
heterogeneous, changing rural contexts.

Programmatic lessons
Haku Wiñay’s focus on aligning its efforts with the local Andean cultural dynamics has
been a significant asset, but it does make replication of efforts in other areas of Peru
challenging. A significant part of Haku Wiñay’s success lies in a design informed by
experience accumulated over decades of rural development interventions in the Andes.
Replicating this approach in other areas of Peru, with their different social dynamics
or where a different history of interaction with rural development interventions has
prevailed, has been difficult. As a result, Haku Wiñay has been less successful in the
Peruvian northern highlands and in jungle areas (Asensio, Fernández, and Burneo
2016; Díez Hurtado and Correa Aste 2016). These societies are not familiar with the
notions of yachachiqs and executing nuclei, and they lack local equivalents.
Haku Wiñay’s experience demonstrates the value of a market link approach, which
can contribute to economic gains by households, but also carries its own challenges
and risks. Haku Wiñay attempts to link households with small rural producer markets.
Without these efforts, the impact of the program is likely to be much smaller, reach
233

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

fewer people, and dilute more quickly. Such interventions can gradually bring rural
producers closer to markets and increase household incomes, but they come with
significant costs and can distort markets. By paying users’ transaction costs, Haku
Wiñay may end up harming other, more dynamic autonomous producers. Required,
then, is consideration of the potential systemic impact of interventions on the economic
dynamics of each territory.
Increasingly, the key tenets of Haku Wiñay’s theory of change—that is, the
­importance of rural production and the centrality of the community as a space for
­decision-making—are shifting, likely requiring changes in its programming approach.
Haku Wiñay has adopted an approach that, at its core, regards agricultural production as the main driver of economic well-being of rural families. Many studies show,
however, that increasingly rural households, especially the most dynamic ones,
embrace complex income-generating strategies that no longer depend exclusively on
agricultural production. Rural families also often have complex residential strategies,
which involve their members moving between rural and urban spaces, temporarily or
permanently. Thus Haku Wiñay’s dependence on the community as a decision-making
place for economic well-being is a premise that corresponds less and less with reality.
For Foncodes and MIDIS, the challenge in the coming years will be to offer
economic inclusion interventions that attract an evolving rural population. Expanding
secondary education in rural areas has created new expectations and abilities among
the rural population, especially the younger generations. Although agricultural activities
will continue to be important for many families, especially the poorest, it will be necessary to build complementary programs and promote an expansion of the Haku Wiñay
menu to nonagricultural activities that reflect the evolving Peruvian rural context and
take advantage of new opportunities.

Survey Methodology
This appendix is an overview of the methodology used in executing the survey and
analyses underpinning chapters 3 and 4 of this report.

Mapping the economic inclusion program universe
The Partnership for Economic Inclusion (PEI) Landscape Survey 2020 is a comprehensive inventory of ongoing economic inclusion programs or those that are in the development pipeline. For the survey, the PEI management team (PEIMT) defined economic
inclusion programs as multidimensional interventions that support and enable
­households to achieve sustainable livelihoods and increase their incomes and assets,
while building human capital and promoting social inclusion.
To map the universe of economic inclusion programs, PEIMT reviewed the World
Bank financing portfolio as well as external sources. The first stage of the World Bank
portfolio scan involved manually reviewing the ongoing and pipeline programs of the
Social Protection and the Jobs and Development Global Practices (listed in the World
Bank Operations Portal) across all geographical regions. To determine whether a program
focused on economic inclusion, PEIMT reviewed each program’s development objective and the component description included in its project appraisal document (PAD) or,
when a PAD was not available, its project information document (PID), project paper
(PP), or project information and integrated safeguards data sheet (PSDS).
At the second stage, to validate each economic inclusion program and to speed up
the mapping process, PEIMT worked with the Text and Data Analytics (TDA) team in
the Development Economics (DEC) department of the World Bank. Using a predefined
set of keywords,1 the TDA team applied advanced text analytics to program summaries
as well as to their PADs, PIDs, PPs, or PSDSs. They applied this technique to a sample
of approximately 1,200 programs (both active and pipeline) across all geographical
regions under the following Global Practices: Agriculture; Finance, Competitiveness,
and Innovation; Social Protection; Jobs and Development; and Social, Urban, Rural,
and Resilience.2 The team then ranked programs based on the number of keywords
found, and any program that had at least one keyword was considered an economic
inclusion program.3 In the next step, PEIMT compared the TDA-assisted selection with
the manual selection for the Social Protection and the Jobs and Development Global
Practices programs and found that the results were accurate in correctly excluding
programs. The TDA-assisted selection, however, also included far more programs than
did the manual review.
To finalize the mapping of World Bank–financed economic inclusion programs,
the PEIMT team manually reviewed the TDA-assisted selection of economic inclusion
programs for the remaining Global Practices. The team assessed the relevance of a
program based on program summaries, the types of words identified through the TDA
techniques, and the frequency with which keywords came up in the project documents.
When a summary did not provide enough information, the PAD was reviewed to make
a final decision. Overall, the TDA methods allowed the PEIMT to trim the number of
programs for review by half, to 149 World Bank economic inclusion programs, representing 92 individual government programs in 57 countries.4 Surveys were sent to these
92 unique identified programs, and responses were received from 77 of them. The
mapping of World Bank–supported programs was updated in May 2020 through a full
manual review of nearly 50 programs from the Environment and Natural Resources

Global Practice, which resulted in 17 additional programs for a total of 165 economic
inclusion programs supported by the World Bank (table A.1).
To map projects outside of World Bank operations, PEIMT used the PEI Landscape
Survey 2017 data set to identify projects that were still ongoing as well as partners,
including governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), regional organizations, multilaterals, and other development partners involved in economic inclusion
programming. Organizations were approached to self-identify programs that met a
prescribed set of criteria based on the working definition of an economic inclusion
program.5 Because the 2017 survey mostly captured nongovernmental programs, PEIMT
mapped other relevant economic inclusion interventions by scanning several databases
and inventories of social protection and productive inclusion programs, including the
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean Non-contributory Social
Protection Programmes Database and the University of Manchester’s Social Assistance
Explorer database6 (GIZ 2017; IPC-IG and UNICEF 2019; SEEP Network 2018). PEIMT
identified 146 projects outside of the World Bank portfolio, from which 139 responses
were expected and 127 responses were received.7
Despite efforts to map the entire universe of economic inclusion interventions,
additional programs spearheaded by some United Nations agencies, including the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), as well as by some NGOs, were not mapped. The majority of
missing responses were from government programs (25 out of 29 missing responses)
both within and outside World Bank operations. Therefore, the sample is dominated
by World Bank operations and PEI partnership organizations. Because of insufficient
information, it is not possible to assess whether programs not included in the survey
are substantially different in nature from the surveyed programs (which included 96
government-led initiatives). Although the survey sample does not fully represent the
entire universe of economic inclusion programs, by having captured responses from
219 programs in 75 countries and six geographical regions and led by more than 100
organizations, the survey still captures a sufficiently strong variation across regions
and institutional setups to provide a comprehensive overview of economic inclusion
programming worldwide.

The survey tool
The survey questionnaire was developed after broad consultation with World Bank partners, including the Productive Inclusion Knowledge Exchange (PIKE) group and the Atlas
of Social Protection Indicators of Resilience and Equity (ASPIRE) group, and with PEI
partners. Furthermore, the PEI team sent the survey questionnaire to a few programs in
three countries (Malawi, Tunisia, and Zambia) to test its logic and simplify the questions
as much as possible. The 44 questions in the survey were divided into eight sections that
covered basic information on the program, program objectives, target beneficiaries and
237

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

coverage, design and implementation features, institutional arrangements, budget and
financing, research and evaluation, and additional information.
The survey was completed by staff from the lead implementing agency, implementing partners, or other organizations supporting programs.8 It was made available
in English, French, and Spanish through an online platform.9 An offline version was
provided to programs that could not complete the survey online. Each returned survey
represented a unique program. Organizations that were involved in more than one
economic inclusion program filled out several surveys.
The survey was administered between November 2019 and January 2020, with
an update in May 2020 for programs that are a part of the Environment and Natural
Resources Global Practice. This process involved reaching out to economic inclusion
program representatives, soliciting survey responses, following up with emails and
phone calls, and assisting with survey completion as needed.
Because data were self-reported, data quality relied primarily on respondents’
knowledge of the program and understanding of the survey questions. To ensure overall
quality, several quality control features were embedded in the design of the survey tool
and, to further improve data accuracy, PEIMT undertook a full quality review of all of the
forms, checked the completeness and consistency of survey responses during the survey
data collection process, and followed up with survey respondents to request clarifications
or additional information wherever data were missing or inconsistencies were found.

Analysis of survey data
The analysis presented in chapters 3 and 4 is a statistical summary of the survey
results and does not attempt to draw inferences about the universe of economic inclusion programs because this is unknown. For this reason, and after internal consultations, PEIMT decided not to apply weights to the data. Additional analysis, including
cross-tabulations, were performed to shed some light on the factors that may help
explain differences across programs.
The PEI Landscape Survey 2020 of economic inclusion programs provides a more
holistic inventory than the PEI Landscape Survey 2017 and previous editions led by the
Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP). Therefore, trends across these surveys are
not fully comparable (Arévalo, Kaffenberger, and de Montesquiou 2018; CGAP 2016).
The following indicators were added to the survey data to support the analysis: countries’ income group, region, lending category, poverty headcount ratio at the
extreme poverty line of $1.90 per day (2011 US$ at purchasing power parity, PPP), and
population size (most recent data from the World Bank Open Data portal); headcount
ratio using the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative’s Multidimensional
Poverty Index (MPI); average household size (various sources); and whether a country is included in the World Bank’s Classification of Fragile and Conflict-Affected
Situations.10
PEIMT analyzed programs in terms of their primary and secondary entry points
based on the principal objectives or functions of the program (see appendix D). These
points are often the basis for an economic inclusion program’s design. An economic
inclusion program is classified according to three entry points: social safety net (SSN),
livelihoods and jobs (L&J), and financial inclusion (FI). Although programs broadly
fit into these three program entry points, they are diverse and often layer priorities.
For that reason, secondary entry points also play an important role in the design of
economic inclusion programs. To classify the entry points of each program, PEIMT
assessed the program’s name, development objectives, types of components included,
and types of government programs linked to the economic inclusion intervention.

Analysis of coverage data
For this report, the coverage of a country’s economic inclusion programs is considered
to be the number of beneficiaries reached by all of its programs relative to the total
population. The estimates delineate coverage in terms of households (direct beneficiaries) and individuals (direct plus indirect beneficiaries). The individual figure is determined by multiplying direct beneficiaries by average household size. This approach
follows an accepted estimation approach across social protection programs globally
(Beegle et al. 2018; Milazzo and Grosh 2008). Estimates do not account for the potential
spillover and community effects of an intervention.
Of the 219 programs reporting overall, for the coverage analysis the sample is
limited to 201 programs from 73 countries because 18 programs did not report the
coverage numbers. Coverage estimates are likely to be biased with the likely exclusions
of several programs outside of the World Bank Group, as noted earlier.
The survey asked for the number of beneficiaries currently enrolled in the respective programs. Programs could report the number of beneficiaries as the number
of households or the number of individuals. To aggregate coverage data across all
programs, the team calculated the total number of beneficiaries, both direct and indirect, by multiplying the number of direct beneficiaries reported by each program by the
average household size in the country. Because in some programs different members
of the same household are direct recipients of economic inclusion program components, in aggregating coverage figures it was not possible to distinguish between direct
and indirect beneficiaries. Coverage data reported as the number of individuals thus
include both direct and indirect beneficiaries. The programs for which coverage data
are reported currently cover 92.5 million individuals as both direct recipients and indirect beneficiaries, which corresponds to nearly 20 million households.
Because of the tailored nature of economic inclusion programs, PEIMT
­considered coverage equivalents, defined as the number of direct plus indirect
beneficiaries reached by a program relative to the total population and estimated
poverty thresholds, including the national poverty line, extreme poverty line, and
MPI. These equivalent measures provide important illustrations of the potential coverage of programs that have a strong focus on poverty. They also recognize a wider debate on poverty measurement thresholds (see box 4.1). Calculation
of the coverage equivalent at the country level began by adding up the number
of ­individual beneficiaries for all the programs in a given country. The number of
­individual beneficiaries (direct and ­indirect) per country was then compared with
the following:
•• Total population of the country. Source: World Bank (ID: SP.POP.TOTL).
•• Poor population calculated using the total population of the country and the
poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty line (percentage of population).

The most recent data on poverty headcount ratio were retrieved from each ­country’s
database. In addition, population estimates were taken for the same years from the
World Bank Open Data portal.

Comparing beneficiary numbers with the total population does not provide the
most accurate picture of the coverage and scale of economic inclusion programs.
Because a significant majority of economic inclusion programs target the poor, extreme
poor, or ultrapoor populations, comparing the total number of beneficiaries with the
most relevant poverty line renders a more realistic view of the coverage and scale. This
finding raises a complicated question: which poverty line is the most relevant when it
comes to estimating the coverage of economic inclusion programs globally? As noted
earlier, the coverage analysis included in this report uses three different poverty lines:
•• The national poverty line (NPL)
•• Extreme poverty line—at $1.90 per day (2011 US$, PPP)
•• Multidimensional Poverty Index
PEIMT selected a subsample of 20 low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and
compared the coverage equivalent for all three poverty lines. This analysis revealed
that the number of people living below the extreme poverty line mirrors the number
of poor, as defined using the NPL in these countries (figure A.1). However, comparing
the NPL with the MPI reveals a different picture altogether. The MPI calculates poverty
numbers beyond material income using three dimensions—health, education, and
standard of living—and comprises 10 indicators. This calculation results in a significantly higher poverty headcount when compared with the NPL. Thus the coverage of
economic inclusion programs is even lower for certain countries when MPI data are
used (figure A.2). For example, coverage of economic inclusion programs in Ethiopia is
31 percent of the population living below the NPL and only 8 percent of the population
below the MPI line.
PEIMT then compared the coverage of economic inclusion programs as a share of the
poor defined using both the NPL and the extreme poverty line in upper-middle-income
countries (figure A.3). The challenge in using the extreme poverty line arises in

upper-middle-income countries where either the number of people living in extreme
poverty is extremely low, such as in Argentina and Chile, or no people are living below
the extreme poverty line, such as in Jordan and Costa Rica. Therefore, the coverage
numbers reported for these countries using the extreme poverty line look very high and
misleading. In some middle-income and high-income countries, higher poverty lines,
such as the $3.20-a-day and $5.50-a-day poverty lines, may provide a more complete
picture of the prevalence of poverty and trends in poverty reduction than the extreme
poverty line (World Bank 2020). Bearing in mind all of these considerations, PEIMT
chose to use the NPL as the primary unit of analysis.

2. In May 2020, PEI undertook an additional scan of projects under the Environment and Natural
Resources Global Practice.
3. After applying the advanced text analytics, the TDA team distinguished between priority
keywords and regular keywords. Priority keywords were deemed to be more relevant than
regular keywords to economic inclusion programming.
4. The list of 92 programs excludes operations in the pipeline, additional financing projects, and
other projects recently closed, which are included in the list of 149 projects.
5. Programs targeted by the survey had to be in operation and meet at least three of the
following criteria: (1) they aim to increase the assets and income of participants; (2) they
target the extreme poor or vulnerable people; (3) they provide an integrated package of
services (that is, they are multidimensional interventions); and (4) they have a strong national
commitment or vision (for example, in their policy or strategy frameworks).
6. https://dds.cepal.org/bpsnc/lpi; http://www.social-assistance.manchester.ac.uk/data/.
7. For seven programs, the PEIMT was unable to identify a focal point in either the lead
implementing agency or an implementing partner to complete the survey.
8. Two research organizations provided the survey response instead of staff directly involved in
implementation.

APPENDIX B

Review of Program Impact
Methodology for literature review
This appendix describes the quantitative impact evaluations, process evaluations,
and qualitative assessments used for the review of the impact evidence in chapter 5.
These studies cover 80 economic inclusion programs operating in diverse contexts
in 37 ­countries across four regions, as outlined in figure 5.1. The reviewed programs
vary in terms of program typology, institutional arrangements, and size, and they
include pilots, small-scale programs, and large-scale programs. Reviewed programs
may be single or complementary, meaning they feature a bundle of different interventions that can be delivered by one primary agency or by more than one that work
in concert. A single program provides all program components, whereas complementary programs link several programs together. The single programs reviewed
are led by both nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and governments, whereas
all complementary programs are either government-led or are linked with a government program. As for typologies, the bulk of the evidence pertains to livelihoods
and jobs (L&J) and less to social safety nets (SSNs). There are only four evaluations
of programs for which financial inclusion (FI) is a primary objective (of these, three
were experiments). As a result, the discussion in this appendix relies primarily on the
first two typologies.
The following criteria were used to identify programs: (1) the program meets the
definition of economic inclusion used in this report; (2) the program is operating only
in developing countries—low-income countries, lower-middle-income countries, and
upper-middle-income countries in four regions: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South Asia
(SAR), East Asia and Pacific (EAP), and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC); and
(3) the program has at least one quantitative impact evaluation or qualitative assessment, with a greater emphasis on the former.
The following programs were included in the review: (1) programs in the
Partners in Economic Inclusion (PEI) Landscape Survey 2020 with an impact evaluation or qualitative assessment (the majority did not yet have an evaluation);
(2) programs surveyed in the State of the Sector Synthesis Report 2018 by PEI that
had an evaluation or assessment, with a focus on large-scale programs (Arévalo,
Kaffenberger, and de Montesquiou 2018); and (3) programs with evaluations listed
in online research databases1 or that had been reviewed in systematic reviews of
economic inclusion programming or relevant standalone interventions such as SSN,
L&J, and FI programs or that had been evaluated as part of institutional research
agendas on economic inclusion.2
The following studies were included in the review: (1) experimental impact evaluations (individual or cluster randomized controlled trials, RCTs); (2) quasi-experimental
impact evaluations (using a range of methods such as regression discontinuity design,
propensity score matching, and difference-in-difference); and (3) qualitative assessments of impact. Only publicly available papers were included in the review, including published papers in peer-reviewed journals (mostly impact evaluations), working
papers, reports, books, and unpublished papers available online. Primarily, the studies

were published between 2009 and 2020. In the end, 108 studies met these criteria, with
some programs having more than one evaluation.
The quantitative (experimental and quasi-experimental) and qualitative impact
evaluations were used to examine overall impact and to assess the evidence on
the bundling of interventions and heterogeneity (with one exception: there is
reference to qualitative assessments on subjective well-being and empowerment).
For the discussion on the drivers of impact, the impact evaluations were supplemented with nonevaluative qualitative and operational research. Treated and
control participants were referred to as participants and nonparticipants, respectively. Table B.1 at the end of this appendix lists all the programs and evaluations
reviewed in chapter 5, and it is followed by a bibliography of the evaluative and
nonevaluative studies used.

Upcoming research pipeline
The rich research pipeline expected to yield outputs in 2020 and 2021 will respond
to some critical knowledge gaps identified in chapter 5. The majority of programs
in the PEI Landscape Survey 2020 have ongoing or planned impact evaluations and
other research. A large number of these planned impact evaluations (85 percent)
continue to focus on overall impact. However, a subset of programs (government-led
and ­nongovernment-led) are planning more nuanced research on economic i­nclusion
programming design, including impact at scale (25 percent), differential impact
on different population groups (42 percent), bundling of interventions (41 percent
­combination and 10 percent sequencing), and marginal impact of specific interventions (17 percent market links and 4 percent noncognitive skills)—see figure B.1. In
addition, at the time of publication of this report, BRAC has released findings from a
10-year evaluation of its program. Preliminary findings are noted in Chapter 5.3
In addition to this program-specific research, the following research agendas also
have or will soon have useful comparable evidence on economic inclusion programming along different dimensions:
1. F

across six pilot programs in Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru

3. F
 ood and Agriculture Organization’s cash-plus research on complementary SSNs
and livelihood programs in Sub-Saharan Africa (FAO 2018; Soares et al. 2017;

APPENDIX C

Economic Inclusion Program Costing
Survey Methodology and Analysis
Survey sample selection
The Partnership for Economic Inclusion management team (PEIMT) sought to develop a
balanced portfolio of projects to complete the costing survey, thereby ensuring a sufficiently diverse sample of economic inclusion programming. The team began by selecting
28 World Bank projects for the costing survey, drawn from the 149 p
­ rojects identified as
economic inclusion projects from the roughly 1,200 active or pipeline World Bank projects reviewed, as described in appendix A. Selection of projects was based on a review of
the following characteristics, with a view toward creating a balanced portfolio:
•• Income group: low-income, lower-middle-income, or upper-middle-income
•• Geographic group: South Asia, Middle East and North Africa, Africa, Latin America
and the Caribbean, Europe and Central Asia, or East Asia and Pacific
•• World Bank Global Practice
•• Rural or urban
•• Fragile context or nonfragile context
Next, PEIMT sent the costing survey to an additional 47 projects based on their expression of interest through the PEI Landscape Survey 2020.
Of the 75 projects that received the costing survey, 24 World Bank projects and
10 nongovernmental organization (NGO) projects responded. The survey was administered between November 2019 and January 2020. The analysis and follow-up consultations with program ­managers required two to three hours per project and were
completed in February and March 2020, as detailed shortly.

Categorization by entry point
The costing data were segregated by project typology using the entry points to scale
outlined in chapter 1: social safety nets (SSNs), livelihoods and jobs (L&J), and
­financial inclusion (FI). These typologies were reviewed and confirmed by project
teams before being finalized.

Data harmonization
Programs were asked to submit costing information in local currency units (LCUs),
which were expected to be easier for teams to report, or in U.S. dollars where there
were issues with LCU reporting (such as where the currency’s valuation was volatile).
Regardless of which currency was reported, costing data were reported for different
years, and so data points were deflated to 2011 U.S. dollars at purchasing power parity
(PPP) values and then converted to international U.S. dollars using the formulation
[intervention cost(t) ÷ CPI (2011)] ÷ [ICP (2011)]
270

T H E S TAT E O F E C O N O M I C I N C L U S I O N R E P O R T 2 0 2 1 : T H E P O T E N T I A L T O S C A L E

where ICP (2011) is the PPP conversion factor base 2011 of private consumption and
CPI (2011) is the inflation for any given year in 2011 terms. Analysis of overall trends,
presented in chapter 6, used this harmonized data set.

Preliminary project cost analysis and consultations
PEIMT began the costing analysis by assessing the cost structure of each project by
reviewing in turn the intervention costs and project implementation costs as a percentage of the total cost. Next, the team estimated the per unit (beneficiary) U.S. dollar
(2011, PPP) and LCU value of the benefits provided. This estimate included the average unit cost per beneficiary for the project as a whole, as well as that of the constituent components—size of grants and transfers, cost of skills training, coaching and
mentoring, and other program components (see illustrative example in figure C.1). This
preliminary analysis was then shared with the project teams for feedback, followed by
calls with individual project teams to explain the calculations, gather feedback from
each team, and update the analysis. In addition, PEIMT also shared the high-level findings documented in chapter 6 for review and comments, particularly as they related to
the underlying projects.

Calculating the adequacy of benefits
PEIMT sought to determine the adequacy of benefits provided in a given project
in order to understand the value of these benefits for beneficiaries. In the process,
PEIMT developed a benchmark of sorts for other projects trying to determine their
own benefit level. Adequacy was calculated by dividing the cost of a component by

the average annual per capita consumption of the poorest 20 percent of households in
the relevant country.
Consumption data were obtained from the World Bank’s Atlas of Social Protection
Indicators of Resilience and Equity (ASPIRE) household survey data set for all the
countries in the costing sample. When assessing the benefits of cash transfers and
public works (provided to support consumption), PEIMT assumed that benefits were
distributed across all household members as these initiatives are intended to smooth
the consumption of households. On the other hand, for cash grant and asset transfers
(provided to support production), it was assumed that the transfer was for production support and would benefit the household as a single unit of production with no
distribution across household members. Overall, the adequacy calculations rested on a
strong assumption that all the projects target beneficiaries in the bottom quintile in the
respective countries.

Undertaking a qualitative analysis
Because of the varied project objectives and diverse contexts, it was important to put
the cost analysis into perspective using qualitative data. For World Bank projects,
PEIMT reviewed available Project Appraisal Documents and operations manuals, which
provided rich information on the country and institutional context, project components, project beneficiaries, and, in some cases, economic and financial analyses. For
NGO projects, PEIMT reviewed websites and process evaluation documents to gain a
better understanding of the projects. In addition, project teams were asked to share any
­relevant documents that would help in this analysis.

Economic inclusion program costing analysis
The PEIMT costing analysis received data on 24 government and 10 NGO projects.
Table C.1 is a snapshot of all the projects covered in the analysis. It shows the objectives and combinations of components in each project, demonstrating the range of projects covered in the analysis. Figure C.2 shows these projects by their cost composition.

safety net (SSN) as the primary entry point (92 percent versus 54 percent of
livelihoods and jobs [L&J] programs). Almost half of the programs that provide
capital for consumption smoothing are existing government cash transfer programs
(48 percent), and 25 percent of programs with this component are linked to an existing
public works program.
Regular and predictable transfers help poor and vulnerable households meet
their most pressing needs without resorting to negative coping strategies. Temporary
income support can also compensate for the time program participants are not working
while taking part in the program. Consumption support is mostly transferred in cash
(87 percent of programs that include this component), but 30 percent of programs
provide an in-kind transfer. Of the programs that include a cash transfer, 73 percent
provide a direct cash transfer, whereas 32 percent provide such a transfer in exchange
for work. Regardless of the type of program, most interventions rely on a single
modality for the provision of the transfer (70 percent of programs that include a
transfer), but differences emerge in the type of modality used by different entry points
(figure E.2).

Business capital
To contribute to developing or expanding the livelihood base, most programs
provide business capital for establishing or supporting small businesses (80 percent
of all programs), particularly programs seeking to support income diversification
(89 percent of programs with income diversification as a main objective) in order to
address the financial capital constraints faced by poor and vulnerable households.

Business capital can take the form of cash grants (71 percent), in-kind grants and
asset transfers (44 percent), matching grants (17 percent), and soft loans—credit
with favorable conditions (17 percent)—or other forms of support such as coupons
or market rate credit (5 percent). Some programs combine multiple forms of business
capital (figure E.3). More nongovernment-led programs provide business capital than
government-led programs (85 percent versus 76 percent). The costing exercise outlined
in chapter 6 reveals that the average grant size of programs is $381 (2011 US$ at
purchasing power parity, PPP) and is similar for government-led and nongovernmentled projects ($387 and $369, respectively). The average cost of business capital in
nongovernment-led programs ($232) is higher than in government-led programs ($182).
The overall costs in programs led by nongovernment institutions are relatively
evenly spread across multiple components. But in a majority of government-led
programs, the cost is primarily driven by either a consumption support component or a
business capital component.
Cash-based capital (offered by 85 percent of programs providing business capital) is
more commonly provided, mostly as grants, than in-kind (asset) transfers (figure E.3).

Wage employment facilitation
About a third of programs facilitate access to wage employment opportunities
(35 percent of all programs). Forty-five government-led programs in 30 countries
facilitate access to wage employment, 40 percent of which build on an existing

government labor intermediation program. Twenty-seven percent of governmentled programs that facilitate access to wage employment build on active labor market
programs.
Most programs facilitating access to wage employment opportunities (93 percent),
both government- and nongovernment-led, link with potential employers to achieve
better participant outcomes. Most common, programs help beneficiaries to obtain
internships, traineeships, and apprenticeships (figure E.4), after or as part of the
skills training course(s) in order to increase the relevance of new skills and reduce
beneficiaries’ time outside of the labor market. About a third of programs supporting
wage employment establish a pool of curriculum vitae (CVs) from which enterprises
can identify job candidates. Of those programs creating a CV pool, 82 percent also
engage with the private sector to increase the effectiveness of the CV pool.

Skills training
To address the specific needs of targeted groups, economic inclusion programs provide
different types of training, including on entrepreneurship and business management,
financial literacy, and technical, vocational, and life skills (figure E.5). Some programs

focus on one type of training (8 percent of programs with training), most often
technical or vocational, while others seek to expand participants’ skills with a broader
suite of training opportunities. For example, entrepreneurship training is usually
combined with financial literacy training to increase business management skills more
broadly (71 percent of programs providing training), particularly if program participants
receive financial support for establishing or developing businesses (79 percent versus
35 percent for programs that do not provide business capital).

Coaching
Defined as informal guidance provided in an informal way, coaching is used by
programs to build soft skills, support self-confidence, provide emotional support, and
foster changes in attitudes and social norms. Ninety percent of all programs include
coaching, most of which provide coaching related to the livelihood (84 percent),
particularly business development. Coaching on business development during the
“ideation phase” can enable participants to identify and act on business challenges
and opportunities and help match livelihoods to individual circumstances and market
contexts.1 Counseling on job placement is not widely used because far fewer programs
facilitate access to wage employment.
Economic inclusion programs also use coaching to address the social and
psychosocial barriers to economic inclusion and to improve the overall quality of life
for beneficiaries (68 percent of programs with coaching). Coaching may include topics
on social issues affecting the family and community (such as child marriage and

intrahousehold dynamics), psychosocial support, and health and nutrition guidance
(figure E.6). This type of coaching is more prevalent among programs working with
vulnerable groups, such as the ultrapoor and the extreme poor populations, than
programs not specifically targeting these groups.

Financial services facilitation
Seventy-one percent of all programs facilitate access to financial services. Most
programs facilitate access to savings (87 percent of programs facilitating access to
financial services), credit (78 percent), or both (66 percent); see figure E.7. Building
savings is particularly important in programs serving households that fall in the
extreme poor category. They are more vulnerable to shocks and have fewer means of
growing their businesses than less poor households.
Insurance, such as index, crop, or livestock, can help households reduce risk
exposure and cope with shocks. However, there is limited availability of appropriate
insurance products and limited uptake by poor and vulnerable households (El-Zoghbi,
Holle, and Soursourian 2019). Moreover, the number of economic inclusion programs
facilitating access to insurance products is low (18 percent of programs facilitating
access to financial services).

Market access facilitation
Seventy-one percent of all programs facilitate integration into markets for program
participants. Programs that facilitate market access follow a mix of market integration
strategies (figure E.8). Facilitating access to inputs, technology, and capital can further
address households’ constraints. Establishing new or developing existing producer
organizations (POs) can help strengthen the position of and increase market access for
small producers.
POs can further support market integration by, for example, facilitating access
to improved inputs, technology, and key market players. Compared with other
programs, programs that develop POs tend to facilitate more access to improved inputs
(84 percent versus 46 percent); access to technology (85 percent versus 30 percent);
links to service providers (76 percent versus 58 percent); links to national, regional,
and local markets (76 percent versus 51 percent); and links to international markets
(24 percent versus 5 percent).2

Fifty-seven percent of economic inclusion programs include interventions that support
the sustainable management of natural resources or climate change adaptation, or both,
as a way of protecting and enhancing the livelihood base of program beneficiaries.
Interventions include water management and land tenure systems (figure E.9), with a

Notes
1. Evaluations of programs in Paraguay and Colombia reveal that participants find the business

plan process empowering because it increases their knowledge and self-confidence about their
enterprise choice (CADEP 2017; Moreno-Sánchez et al. 2018; Escobal and Ponce 2016).
2. All differences are statistically significant at 1 percent, with the exception of the difference in
the links with service providers, which is significant at 5 percent.

adequacy. In this report, the calculation of whether a grant amount, cash transfer
amount, cost of asset transfer, and public works wage received by a beneficiary is sufficient to meet average consumption needs of the poorest households in the respective
countries. Adequacy is calculated by dividing the per beneficiary cost of a component
by the average annual per capita consumption rate for the bottom 20 percent of households in the relevant country.

dosage. The amount of capital required for adequate transfers. In this report, dosage
may refer to a threshold below which programs are deemed to lack the type of impact
necessary to meet the objectives set forth by the program.
economic inclusion. The gradual integration of individuals and households into broader
economic and community development processes. This integration is achieved by addressing the multiple constraints or structural barriers faced by the poor at different levels.
Examples of levels are the household (such as human and physical capacity), the community (such as social norms), the local economy (such as access to markets and services),
and across formal institutions (such as access to political and administrative structures).
Throughout the report, these constraints are viewed as simultaneous and often nonseparable. They are viewed as most intensively affecting extreme poor and vulnerable groups.
economic inclusion program. A bundle of coordinated, multidimensional interventions
that support individuals, households, and communities in their efforts to increase
their incomes and assets. Economic inclusion programs therefore aim to facilitate the
dual goals of strengthening both the resilience of and opportunities for individuals
and households who are poor. These goals are met through strengthening community and local economy links. The term economic inclusion is sometimes used
interchangeably with the term productive inclusion.
extreme poor. See poverty level.
fast climber. See also slow climber. Participants who are experiencing positive changes
during the program and who are on an upward trajectory during the program and after
program exit and manage to sustain those changes afterward.
financial inclusion. One of the three program entry points defined in the report.
Support is provided through the use of savings groups, formal banking services, microcredit, government-to-person (G2P) payments, digital payments, and other means that
have the potential to improve resilience and opportunities for the extreme poor and
vulnerable, particularly women.
fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV). World Bank classification of countries with high
institutional and social fragility and of countries affected by violent conflict.
functional scale-up. Increasing the scope of an activity, where initially a program starts
with a single focus but then layers or links additional multisectoral interventions.
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). One of the two organizations comprising the World Bank (see also International Development Association).
IBRD provides loans and advice to middle-income and credit-worthy poor countries.
IBRD and IDA share the same staff and headquarters and evaluate projects with the
same rigorous standards.
International Development Association (IDA). One of the two organizations comprising
the World Bank (also see International Bank for Reconstruction and Development).
IDA helps the world’s poorest countries. Overseen by 173 shareholder nations, it aims to
reduce poverty by providing loans (called “credits”) and grants for programs that boost
economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people’s living conditions.
livelihoods and jobs. One of the three program entry points defined in the report. For
the poorest and most vulnerable, access to employment tends to be informal, risky,

and often limited by constraints to the labor supply—human capital (such as education,
skills, and networks)—and labor demand—the business environment (such as access
to finance, infrastructure, technology, and markets). An increasing number of livelihood
and job programs are focusing on removing barriers that prevent the extreme poor
and vulnerable (such as poor households in rural or urban areas, youth, refugees, and
women) from participating in the local economy and in higher-productivity jobs.
Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). A measure of the prevalence of poverty based
on indicators that go beyond monetary metrics and span three dimensions: health,
education, and standard of living. The MPI is overseen by the Oxford Poverty and
Human Development Initiative at the University of Oxford.
nongovernmental organization (NGO). An organization that is neither part of a government nor a conventional profit-maximizing business. Although some NGOs may accept
funding from governments or work in collaboration with government agencies, an NGO
is by definition not itself a governmental entity.
nongovernment-led. Programs led by institutions other than governments.
opportunity. The capacity of households in economic inclusion programs to capture
and capitalize on investments that improve human capital outcomes and that they
would otherwise miss.
poverty level.
poor. Persons whose consumption is below the national poverty line, as defined by
the government. Or those who, because of their personal or community characteristics, face barriers in accessing opportunities to earn sustainable livelihoods and have
elevated risks of being or staying in poverty or being socially marginalized.
extreme poor. Persons whose consumption is below $1.90 per day (2011 US$ at
purchasing power parity, PPP) and who can work on a sustained basis. Also defined
as the bottom 50 percent of the poor population in a country or those unable to

to buy the same amount of goods and services in the domestic market as a U.S. dollar
would buy in the United States.
randomized controlled trial (RCT). A program evaluation in which participants and
nonparticipants are deemed to be statistically comparable and in which participants
are randomly allocated to receive a given intervention. By monitoring outcomes in both
groups, an RCT reveals the differences that can be attributed to a specific program
intervention.
resilience. The strengthened ability of a household to manage risk and respond to and

rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA). A group of individuals who meet
regularly in order to save and borrow together.
scale-up or scale. The process by which a program is established, expanded, or
adapted under real-world conditions into broader national policy and programming.
Scale-up often builds on the success of programs shown to be effective on a small
scale or under controlled conditions. Scale-up may also be driven without prior piloting
and testing, and often in response to a political decision or directive.
Scale-up is is not just about coverage—the number of beneficiaries served by the
program in relation to the total population of the country—but also about quality—the
quality of impact and sustainability of coverage, as well as processes of change and
adaptation. Economic inclusion at scale therefore considers the programmatic and institutional mechanics required to embed programs at the national level through largescale antipoverty programs, led by governments with clear alignment with national
strategies, partnership development, and underlying political economy considerations.
self-help program. A savings-and-credit group consisting of women and men who meet
regularly and undertake financial savings and internal loans from the group’s common
funds. Self-help groups can be federated, with each group represented in a federation
structure that can serve as a platform for economic inclusion, linking the poorest to the
formal banking system and enabling a range of services, including insurance, credit
counseling, sound financial practice orientation, as well as digital and mobile banking.
single/complementary program. Economic inclusion program packages feature a
bundle of different interventions that can be delivered either by one primary organization or by more than one, working in concert. In single programs, one program provides
all program components, whereas complementary programs link several programs
together.
slow climber. See also fast climber. A participant who may only gradually begin to
experience positive changes during the program.
social protection. Social protection and labor systems, policies, and programs that help
individuals and societies manage risk and volatility and protect them from poverty and
destitution by means of instruments that improve equity, resilience, and opportunity.
social safety net or safety net. One of the three program entry points defined in the
report. Noncontributory transfer programs target in some manner the poor and those
vulnerable to poverty and shocks. Social safety nets can include cash, in-kind transfers,
social pensions, public works, and school feeding programs aimed at poor and vulnerable households. It is analogous to the U.S. term welfare and the European term social
assistance.
social safety net–plus (SSN-plus). A term together with cash-plus gaining prominence
as countries expand the coverage and financing of safety net programs, in particular
cash transfers. The “plus” indicates the potential to complement cash with additional
inputs, service components, or links to external services.
ultrapoor. See poverty level.
vulnerable group. See poverty level.

The State of Economic Inclusion Report 2021 sheds light on one of the most intractable challenges
faced by development policy makers and practitioners: transforming the economic lives of the world’s
poorest and most vulnerable people.
Economic inclusion programs are a bundle of coordinated, multidimensional interventions that
support individuals, households, and communities so they can raise their incomes and build their
assets. Programs targeting the extreme poor and vulnerable groups are now under way in 75
countries.
This report presents data and evidence from 219 of these programs, which are reaching over
90 million beneficiaries. Governments now lead the scale-up of economic inclusion interventions,
often building on preexisting national programs such as safety nets, livelihoods and jobs, and
financial inclusion, and 93 percent of the total beneficiaries are covered by government programs.
The report offers four important contributions:
•

A detailed analysis of the nature of these programs, the people living in extreme poverty
and vulnerability whom they support, and the organizational challenges and opportunities
inherent in designing and leading them.

•

An evidence review of 80 quantitative and qualitative evaluations of economic inclusion
programs in 37 countries.

• The first multicountry costing study including both government-led and other economic
inclusion programs, indicating that programs show potential for cost efficiencies when
integrated into national systems.
•

Four detailed case studies featuring programs under way in Bangladesh, India, Peru, and
the Sahel, which highlight the programmatic and institutional adaptations required to scale
in quite diverse contexts.

Data from the report are available on the PEI Data Portal (http://www.peiglobal.org), where users
can explore and submit data to build on this baseline.
