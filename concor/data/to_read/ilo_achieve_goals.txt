Preface

S

ocial protection and the right to social security have been an integral element of
the ILO’s mandate since its creation in 1919. Since then, the ILO has supported its
member States in progressively extending coverage and building their social protection
systems, based on internationally agreed social security standards and good practice.
While few countries had social protection systems in place a century ago, today virtually all countries do, and efforts to extend social protection coverage and benefits are
continuing.
Over that period the ILO has developed and adopted a series of international standards which set out a normative framework for the right to social security. Complementing international human rights instruments, this normative framework today includes
16 up-to-date social security standards which guide national social protection policies.
The most recently adopted standard, the ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), reflects the global tripartite commitment to guarantee at least a
basic level of social security to all in the form of a nationally defined social protection
floor, and to ensure progressively wider scope and higher levels of protection.
This commitment to building social security systems, including floors, is also reflected in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Most prominently, SDG 1.3
calls upon countries to implement nationally appropriate social protection systems for
all, including floors, for reducing and preventing poverty. Furthermore, the importance
of social protection for sustainable development is reflected in several other goals, including universal health coverage (SDG 3.8), gender equality (SDG 5.4), decent work
and economic growth (SDG 8.5) and greater equality (SDG 10.4). Social protection
policies not only protect people from various shocks across the life cycle, but also play
a key role in boosting domestic demand and productivity, supporting structural transformation of national economies, and promoting decent work.
In light of the ambitious goals to be achieved by 2030, this World Social Protection Report provides a comprehensive assessment of the current state of social protection systems around the globe, their coverage, benefits, and expenditures, following a
life-cycle approach. It highlights progress in expanding social protection as well as remaining gaps that need to be closed, and discusses key challenges to the realization of
the right to social security. Based on the comprehensive ILO World Social Protection
Database and the ILO Social Security Inquiry, an administrative survey submitted to

v

vi

countries, the report presents first estimates of disaggregated coverage indicators for the
monitoring of SDG indicator 1.3.1. Providing extensive, in-depth country-level statistics on various dimensions of social security, it thus serves as an essential reference for
policy-makers and anyone interested in social protection.
While social protection is at the centre of the 2030 Development Agenda, the right
to social security is not yet a reality for some 71 per cent of the world’s population that
has no or has only partial access to comprehensive social protection systems. It is clear
that countries need to step up measures towards realizing this right.
At the same time the world is facing a number of fundamental challenges, such as
demographic change, low economic growth, migration, conflicts and environmental
problems. Employment patterns are evolving fast, with new forms of employment on
the rise, with limited job and income security, and without adequate social protection.
Growing income insecurity, including among the middle class, as well as decent work
deficits have weighed heavily on perceptions of social justice and challenged the implicit social contract in many societies, while in others fiscal consolidation policies have
threatened the long-term progress achieved towards the realization of the human right
to social security and of other human rights.
These challenges can and must be addressed. Extending social protection coverage
to those previously excluded and adapting social protection systems to new forms of
work and employment, are essential to tackling decent work deficits and reducing vulnerability and insecurity.
The case for social protection is compelling in our times. Social protection measures
not only support the realization of the human right to social security, but are both an
economic and a social necessity. Well-designed social protection systems contribute to
reducing poverty and inequality, while enhancing social cohesion and political stability.
The important role of social protection for inclusive economic growth is underlined by
bold efforts in strengthening social protection systems in a number of low- and middleincome countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. Such progress
in building social protection systems, including floors, demonstrates that our societies
can afford to provide at least a basic level of social security to all, and to progressively
extend the scope and level of social security coverage.
I hope that this report will be a valuable tool for practitioners and serve as an evidence-based resource for policy-makers in their pursuit to strengthen social protection,
promote social justice and foster sustainable development.

Executive summary

S

ocial protection, or social security, is a human
right and is defined as the set of policies and programmes designed to reduce and prevent poverty and
vulnerability throughout the life cycle. Social protection includes benefits for children and families, maternity, unemployment, employment injury, sickness, old
age, disability, survivors, as well as health protection.
Social protection systems address all these policy areas
by a mix of contributory schemes (social insurance) and
non-contributory tax-financed benefits, including social
assistance.
Social protection plays a key role in achieving sustainable development, promoting social justice and realizing the human right to social security for all. Thus,
social protection policies are vital elements of national
development strategies to reduce poverty and vulnerability across the life cycle and support inclusive and
sustainable growth by raising household incomes, fostering productivity and human development, boosting
domestic demand, facilitating structural transformation of the economy and promoting decent work.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
adopted at the United Nations General Assembly in
2015 reflect the joint commitment of countries to
“implement nationally appropriate social protection
systems for all, including floors” for reducing and
preventing poverty (SDG 1.3). This commitment to
universalism reaffirms the global agreement on the extension of social security achieved by the Social Protection Floors Recommendation No. 202, adopted in
2012 by the governments and workers’ and employers’
organizations from all countries.

This ILO flagship report provides a global overview of
recent trends in social protection systems, including social
protection floors. It analyses the current state of social
protection for children, for women and men of working
age, and for older persons, following a life-cycle approach.
Based on new data, the report offers a broad range of
global, regional and country data on social protection
coverage, benefits and public expenditures on social protection. It presents new estimates on effective social
­protection coverage for a comprehensive monitoring of
social protection systems, including floors, thereby providing the 2015 baseline for the SDG indicator 1.3.1.
Highlights:
• Despite significant progress in the extension of social
protection in many parts of the world, the human
right to social security is not yet a reality for a majority of the world’s population. Only 45 per cent of the
global population are effectively covered by at least
one social protection benefit, while the remaining
55 per cent – as many as 4 billion people – are left
unprotected (figure 1).
• ILO estimates also show that only 29 per cent of the
global population are covered by comprehensive social
security systems that include the full range of benefits,
from child and family benefits to old-age pensions.
Yet the large majority – 71 per cent, or 5.2 billion
people – are not, or are only partially, protected.
• Coverage gaps are associated with a significant
­underinvestment in social protection, particularly
in Africa, Asia and the Arab States (figure 2).

Executive summary

• Lack of social protection leaves people vulnerable to
poverty, inequality and social exclusion across the
life cycle, thereby constituting a major obstacle to
economic and social development.
• The SDGs call for universal social protection. In
particular, countries have a responsibility to guarantee at least a basic level of social security – a social
protection floor – for all, as part of their social protection systems. While many countries have already achieved universal protection, more efforts
are needed to extend coverage and ensure adequate
benefits.

Social protection for children
Transfers for children and families, in cash or in kind,
are critical for realizing children’s rights by preventing
them from falling into poverty, preventing child mortality, contributing to their healthy development and
well-being, improving their access to essential goods
and services, and reducing child labour. Social protection thus ensures that children can realize their full potential and enjoy an adequate standard of living.
Highlights:
• Only 35 per cent of children worldwide enjoy
effective access to social protection, albeit with significant regional disparities. Almost two-thirds of
children globally – 1.3 billion children – are not
covered, most of them living in Africa and Asia.
• On average, 1.1 per cent of GDP is spent on child
and family benefits for children aged 0–14, pointing to a significant underinvestment in children,
which affects not only the children’s overall well-being and long-term development, but also the future
economic and social development of the countries
they live in.
• Cash transfers for children have expanded in lowand middle-income countries over the past decades,
with a number of countries reaching universal social
protection coverage of children (e.g. Argentina,
Brazil, Chile and Mongolia). However, coverage and
benefit levels remain insufficient in many countries.
• A number of countries reduce social protection for
children in the wake of fiscal consolidation policies,
often narrow-targeting child benefits to the poor
and leaving many vulnerable children without adequate protection. Efforts are required to step up

measures to adequately address the needs of children and families, extending coverage and benefits
in accordance with SDG 1.3.

Social protection for women and men
of working age: maternity and disability
benefits, employment injury protection,
unemployment support
Social protection plays a key role in ensuring income
security for women and men of working age, in the
form of maternity protection, unemployment support,
employment injury protection, and disability benefits.
These schemes contribute to smooth incomes and aggregate demand, enhance human capital, and promote
decent and productive employment. Social protection
also facilitates structural change within economies and
labour markets, and contributes to inclusive and sustainable growth.
Highlights:
• Social protection coverage for persons of working
age is still limited. Despite the positive developmental impacts of supporting childbearing women, only
41.1 per cent of mothers with newborns receive a
maternity benefit, while 83 million new mothers
remain uncovered.
• As only 21.8 per cent of unemployed workers are
covered by unemployment benefits, 152 million unemployed workers remain without coverage.
• Only a minority of the global labour force have
effective access to employment injury protection.
• New ILO data also show that only 27.8 per cent of
persons with severe disabilities worldwide receive a
disability benefit.
• Expenditure estimates show that worldwide only
3.2 per cent of GDP is spent on public social protection to ensure income security for persons of working age, although they constitute a large proportion
of the global population.
• Effective universal maternity coverage has been
achieved in Ukraine and Uruguay, and other developing countries such as Argentina, Colombia,
Mongolia and South Africa have made significant
progress. Additionally, Brazil, Chile and Mongolia have universal disability benefit programmes in
place. However, significant coverage and adequacy
gaps remain in many countries.

xxxi

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

• A number of countries are scaling down protection
for men and women of working age as part of fiscal
consolidation or austerity policies, narrow-targeting
benefits to the poor and leaving many persons unprotected, at a time when social protection is most
needed.
• In light of the recent labour market and employment challenges, such as persistent unemployment
and underemployment, the prevalence of precarious and informal employment as well as the rise of
working poverty, social protection systems, including floors, are essential policies to ensure adequate
income security and decent work, particularly where
they are well coordinated with employment, wage
and tax policies.

Social protection for older women and men

xxxii

Pensions for older women and men are the most widespread form of social protection in the world, and a key
element in SDG 1.3.
Highlights:
• Worldwide, 68 per cent of people above retirement
age receive an old‑age pension, which is associated
with the expansion of both non-contributory and
contributory pensions in many middle- and lowincome countries.
• A number of countries have achieved universal pension coverage, including Argentina, Belarus, the
Plurinational State of Bolivia, Botswana, Cabo
Verde, China, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Maldives, Mauritius, Mongolia, Namibia, Seychelles,
South Africa, Swaziland, T
­ imor-Leste, Trinidad
and Tobago, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Zanzibar
(United Republic of Tanzania). Other developing countries, such as Azerbaijan, Armenia, Brazil,
Chile, Kazakhstan, Thailand and Uruguay are close
to universal coverage.
• However, benefit levels are often low and not sufficient to push older persons out of poverty. The adequacy of pension benefits remains a challenge in
many countries.
• Expenditures on pensions and other benefits for
older persons account for 6.9 per cent of GDP on
average, with large variations across regions.
• Fiscal consolidation or austerity pressures in many
countries continue to jeopardize the long‑term

ad­equacy of pensions; it is necessary to maintain a
good balance between sustainability and adequacy
in the context of ageing populations.
• A noticeable trend is the reversal of pension privatizations: privatization policies did not deliver the
expected results and countries like Argentina, the
Plurinational State of Bolivia, Hungary, Kazakhstan and Poland are returning to public solidaritybased systems.

Towards universal health coverage
Universal health coverage, providing effective access to
at least essential health care including long‑term care, is
key to achieving the SDGs, particularly SDG 3.
Highlights:
• ILO estimates show that the right to health is not
yet a reality in many parts of the world, especially
in rural areas where 56 per cent of the population
lack health coverage as compared to 22 per cent in
urban areas.
• An estimated 10 million health workers are needed
to achieve universal health coverage and ensure
human security, including from highly infectious
diseases like Ebola. The shortfall of 7 million
skilled health workers in rural areas as well as high
deficits in per capita health spending add to these
­rural‌–‌urban inequities. Ensuring equity in access to
quality care and solidarity in financing is central to
extending health protection.
• Long-term care (LTC) is mostly needed by older persons with limited ability to care for themselves due
to physical or mental conditions. Currently, more
than 48 per cent of the world’s population live in
countries which do not provide any LTC protection
to older persons, with women disproportionately
affected. Another 46.3 per cent of the older global
population are largely excluded from LTC due to
narrow means-testing regulations that require older
persons to be poor to become eligible for LTC services. Only 5.6 per cent of the global population live
in countries that provide LTC coverage based on
­national legislation to the whole population.
• Given ageing populations, LTC needs to be properly
addressed by public policies. Currently, an estimated
global 57 million unpaid “voluntary” workers are
filling in the LTC workforce gap and carry out the

Executive summary

bulk of this work; many of them are women who
have to provide informal care for family members.

social protection floors and enhance the adequacy
of benefits.

• Care services can generate millions of jobs to address the shortage of skilled care workers, estimated
at 13.6 million globally. Efforts are needed to improve working conditions for many health and care
workers, including labour rights and adequate compensation, to transform unpaid work into decent
jobs and contribute to full employment and inclusive growth.

• In the Arab States, the lack of data allows only a
partial assessment of effective social protection coverage. Coverage for old-age pensions is limited, estimated at 27.4 per cent, and is expected to persist due
to the low share (32.9 per cent) of active contributors in the total labour force. Positive achievements
in the region include the introduction of a social
insurance scheme for private sector workers in the
Occupied Palestinian Territory, the establishment
of unemployment insurance schemes in Bahrain,
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and enhanced coverage
for maternity protection in Jordan and Iraq. Extending social protection floors to vulnerable groups
remains central in the region, especially in light of
large social needs and high informal employment in
some countries.

Monitoring progress in social protection:
Regional trends
Observed trends in social protection coverage (SDG indicator 1.3.1) vary substantially across regions and even
between countries within the same region.
• In Africa, despite significant progress in the extension of social protection coverage, only 17.8 per cent
of the population receive at least one social protection cash benefit, with significant variation across
countries. Owing to greater efforts towards extending old-age protection, 29.6 per cent of Africa’s
older population now receive a pension. Countries
such as Botswana, Cabo Verde, Lesotho, Mauritius
and Namibia have reached, or approached, universal pension coverage. However, significant coverage gaps remain with respect to children, mothers
with newborns, unemployed workers, persons with
disabilities as well as vulnerable populations. The
development of social protection floors is therefore
an urgent priority in Africa.
• In the Americas, 67.6 per cent of the population
are effectively covered by at least one social protection cash benefit, primarily as a result of the
extension of social protection systems over recent
decades. More than two-thirds of children, pregnant women and mothers of newborns, as well as
older persons, are covered by social protection cash
benefits, yet larger gaps exist for disability and unemployment benefits. Some countries have successfully achieved universal or near‑universal coverage
of children (Argentina, Brazil, Chile), mothers
with newborns (Canada, Uruguay), persons with
disabilities (Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, United States)
and older persons (Argentina, Plurinational State
of Bolivia, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, United
States). However, countries in the region need to
intensify efforts to close coverage gaps, reinforce

• In the Asia and Pacific region, only 38.9 per cent
of the population are effectively covered by at least
one social protection cash benefit, although significant progress has been made in strengthening social
protection systems and building social protection
floors. Large coverage gaps remain in the areas of
child and family benefits, maternity protection, unemployment protection and disability benefits. It
is however worth noting that some countries have
achieved universal coverage of children (Australia,
Mongolia); others have extended maternity protection coverage (Bangladesh, India, Mongolia), or
introduced non-contributory pension schemes to
achieve universal coverage for older persons (China,
Mongolia, New Zealand, Timor‑Leste); yet adequacy of benefits remains a concern.
• In Europe and Central Asia, given relatively comprehensive and mature social protection systems,
including floors, 84.1 per cent of the region’s population have access to at least one cash social protection benefit. Regional coverage estimates exceed
80 per cent for child and family benefits, maternity cash benefits, disability benefits and old‑age
pensions, with several countries reaching universal coverage. However, there are concerns regarding
persistent coverage gaps in the areas of maternity
and unemployment protection, as well as regarding
the adequacy of pensions and other social protection benefits in the light of demographic change and
short-term austerity fiscal pressures.

Global trends and outlook
Looking ahead to 2030, world governments have agreed
to make significant progress towards implementing­
nationally appropriate social protection systems for all,
including floors, as part of the SDG agenda.
• With nearly half of the world population covered
by at least one social protection benefit in 2015
(SDG 1.3 baseline), many countries have come a
long way in strengthening their social protection
systems, including social protection floors to guarantee at least a basic level of social security to all.
However, more efforts are necessary to ensure that
the right to social security becomes a reality for all.

xxxiv

• The aggregate level of public expenditure on social
protection needs to be increased to extend social
protection coverage, particularly in African, Asian
and Arab States’ countries with marked underinvestment in social protection.
• While extending coverage is a primary objective, attention needs to be paid to benefit adequacy, as the
levels of social protection benefits are often insufficient to bring people out of poverty and insecurity.
• The extension of social protection coverage to those
in the informal economy and facilitating their transition to the formal economy are key to promoting decent work and preventing poverty. Coverage
extension can be achieved in multiple ways, the
most common being a mix of contributory and
non-­contributory schemes.

• Building inclusive social protection systems also requires the adaptation of social protection systems to
demographic change, the evolving world of work,
migration, fragile contexts and environmental
challenges.
• Short-term austerity or fiscal consolidation reforms
are undermining long-term development efforts.
Reforms often have a fiscal objective to achieve cost
savings, ignoring negative social impacts with regard
to coverage and benefit adequacy and thus jeopardizing advances towards achieving the SDGs. Further
efforts are needed to prevent fiscal consolidation
policies from destabilizing the important progress
achieved.
• Fiscal space exists even in the poorest countries.
There is a wide variety of options to generate resources for social protection. It is imperative that
countries become proactive in exploring all possible
financing alternatives to promote the SDGs and national development through decent jobs and social
protection.
• Universal social protection is supported through
the joint efforts of the United Nations agencies
“working as one”, by the concerted joint efforts with
relevant international, regional, subregional and national institutions and social partners, including
through the Global Partnership for Universal Social
Protection.

KEY MESSAGES
nn
Social protection, or social security, is a human right and is defined as the set of policies and programmes designed to reduce and prevent poverty and vulnerability throughout the life cycle. Social protection includes child and family benefits, maternity protection, unemployment support, employment
injury benefits, sickness benefits, health protection, old-age benefits, disability benefits and survivors’
benefits. Social protection systems address all these policy areas by a mix of contributory schemes
(social insurance) and non-contributory tax-financed benefits, including social assistance.
nn
World leaders adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. SDG 1.3 commits
countries to implement nationally appropriate social protection systems for all, including floors, for
reducing and preventing poverty. This commitment reaffirms the global agreement on the extension
of social security achieved by the ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202),
adopted by representatives of workers, employers and governments from all countries.
nn
Social protection is at the forefront of the development agenda, given its positive social and economic
impacts. It is a key element of national strategies to promote human development, political stability
and inclusive growth; it ensures that people enjoy income security and have effective access to health
and other social services, and are empowered to take advantage of economic opportunities. By raising
household incomes, such policies play a key role in boosting domestic demand, supporting structural
transformation of national economies, promoting decent work, and fostering inclusive and sustainable
growth. They also create a conducive environment for the development of sustainable enterprises.
nn
But social protection is not yet a reality for a majority of the world’s population, despite some progress over the last few years. As many low- and middle-income countries have established social
protection systems and extended coverage, 45 per cent of the global population are now protected
in at least one social protection policy area, yet the majority – 55 per cent – remain unprotected.
Still today only 29 per cent of the global population enjoy access to comprehensive social security
systems, whereas 71 per cent are covered partially or not at all.
nn
Exclusion from social protection is unacceptable, as the lack of protection leaves people vulnerable to
the financial consequences of life-cycle shocks such as ill health, maternity or old age, or poverty and
social exclusion. Such lack of social protection also constitutes a major obstacle to economic and social
development, associated with high and persistent levels of poverty, inequality and economic insecurity.
nn
Looking ahead to 2030, governments have agreed to make significant progress towards implementing
nationally appropriate social protection systems for all, including floors, as part of the SDG agenda.
States have the legal obligation to protect and promote human rights, including the right to social
protection or social security. Many countries have come a long way in strengthening their social
protection systems and building nationally adapted social protection floors to guarantee at least a
basic level of social security to all. In many countries, this process has been effective and inclusive
through a broad national dialogue, which has brought together governments with social partners and
other stakeholders to chart a way forward in extending social protection.
nn
This report provides latest data to monitor SDG 1.3. The report is based on the ILO World Social
Protection Database, which provides in-depth country-level statistics and key indicators on various
dimensions of social protection systems.

1.1 Leaving no one behind: Social protection
in the 2030 Development Agenda

2

World leaders adopted the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) in September 2015 at the United Nations. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
holds a powerful promise for the world’s population:
by 2030, the world will have made significant progress
towards sustainable development and social, economic
and environmental justice (UN, 2017a; UNRISD,
2016). The first global reports on progress towards
reaching the SDGs show however that there is still
a long way to go to achieve these goals, in particular
reaching those who are at risk of being left behind (UN,
2017b, 2017c).
Social protection is fundamental to achieving the
SDGs, to promoting social justice and to realizing the
human right to social security for all.1 Through its contribution to the social and economic pillars of sustainable development, it is reflected directly or indirectly
in at least five of the 17 SDGs (see box 1.1). It also contributes to the environmental pillar through its role in
­facilitating the “just transition” toward greener economies and societies. Social protection therefore plays
a key role in accelerating progress towards the SDGs
(Kaltenborn, 2015; UN, 2017c; UNRISD, 2016).
Social protection, or social security, is defined as the
set of policies and programmes designed to reduce and
prevent poverty and vulnerability across the life cycle.
Social protection includes nine main areas: child and
family benefits, maternity protection, unemployment
support, employment injury benefits, sickness benefits, health protection, old-age benefits, disability benefits and survivors’ benefits. Social protection systems
address all these policy areas by a mix of contributory
schemes (social insurance) and non-contributory taxfinanced social assistance.
Social protection systems are fundamental not only
in reducing poverty, but also in preventing that people
fall (back) into poverty across the life cycle (Bastagli et
al., 2016; Chronic Poverty Advisory Network, 2014).
This is one critical element of any policy framework
aiming at leaving no one behind (SDG target 1.3). This
target highlights in particular the global commitment
to building social protection floors, as the fundamental
element of each country’s social protection system, to

SDG Target 1.3: Implement nationally
appropriate social protection systems
and measures for all, including floors,
and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable.
SDG Indicator 1.3.1: Proportion of population covered by social protection systems and floors, by sex,
distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older
persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women

and the vulnerable.

ensure at least a basic level of social security for all and
to extend social protection coverage to those hitherto
excluded. Such social protection floors are essential for
alleviating and preventing poverty, vulnerability and
social exclusion by guaranteeing at least a basic level
of income security and effective access to health care
throughout the life course, in line with the ILO Social
Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202)
(UN, 2014; UN, forthcoming).
Social protection systems also contribute to achieving health outcomes, in particular by contributing to
realizing universal health coverage, including financial protection in health and ensuring access to quality
essential health-care services as well as access to safe,
effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and
vaccines for all (SDG target 3.8). Investment to achieve
universal health coverage is critical to the attainment of
the SDGs (WHO, 2017), including with regard to reducing health inequalities (Deaton, 2013).
The contribution of social protection to gender
equality is recognized in particular with regard to recognizing and valuing unpaid care and domestic work
(SDG target 5.4). Along with the provision of public
care services and infrastructure, social protection systems can play a major role in redistributing care responsibilities, and recognizing and valuing unpaid work.
Social protection includes an array of care policies,
starting from maternity protection, through paternity
and parental leave provisions and early childhood care
and education services, to care of adults in later life
(ILO, 2016a; UN Women, 2015).
Social protection is also indispensable to the promotion of decent work and inclusive growth (SDG
target 8.5). As one of the four pillars of decent work,

and targets with a direct or indirect reference
to social protection
Target 1.3 – Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and
measures for all, including floors, and
by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of
the poor and the vulnerable.
Target 3.8 – Achieve universal health
coverage, including financial risk protection, access to qualit y essential

Target 5.4 – Recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through
the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies
and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the

Target 8.5 – By 2030, achieve full and
productive employment and decent
work for all women and men, including
for young people and persons with
disabilities, and equal pay for work of
equal value. [Social protection is one of
the four pillars of decent work.]
Target 10.4 – Adopt policies, especially
fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve greater
equality.

social protection contributes to the promotion of
employment, fosters higher labour productivity and
investments in human capital and capabilities, and stabilizes aggregate demand during major economic crises
(ILO, 2014a). As the world struggles with high levels
of unemployment, underemployment and informality,
social protection systems adapt to ensure the protection
of incomes and to facilitate access to health, education
and decent employment, including for those in precarious and informal employment (ILO, 2017a, 2016b,
2013a). By this token, social protection can also have a
positive impact on productivity, local economic development and inclusive growth (Alderman and Yemtsov,
2013; Davis et al., 2016; Lee and Torm, 2015), as well as
on aggregate demand (Atkinson, 1999), thus supporting inclusive economic growth and social progress.
Social protection policies are also an important component of policies to contain and reduce inequality, including income inequality (SDG target 10.4). Together

with tax policies, social protection systems are among
the channels for the redistribution of income, and they
also play a significant role in addressing non-­income
inequality, such as reducing inequality in access to
health and education. Recent studies have demonstrated the important contribution of social protection
to the reduction of inequalities in Asia (ESCAP, 2015)
and Latin America (López-Calva and Lustig, 2010;
Ocampo and Gómez-Arteaga, 2016) and to promoting inclusive growth (IMF, 2014a; Ostry, Berg and
­Tsangarides, 2014).
In addition, social protection contributes to several other SDGs, including eliminating hunger by
promoting food security and access to improved nutrition (SDG 2), facilitating access to quality education
(SDG 4), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7). By contributing to
investments in people, promoting productive employment and facilitating structural change of the economy,
social protection systems also contribute to building
resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation
(SDG 9). They also contribute to making cities and
human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable by providing income security and access to social
services for residents (SDG 11, notably targets 11.1 and
11.5), ensuring more sustainable consumption and production patterns by allowing people to plan ahead and
avoid environmentally harmful behaviour (SDG 12),
fostering climate action by providing income support
to households affected by climate-related hardship or
by “green policies” leading to the phasing out of certain
industries (SDG 13, notably target 13.3), and contributing to environmental conservation by offering offsetting income security measures to reduce exploitation
of marine and land resources (SDGs 14 and 15). Social
protection systems are also a key element of policies
promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, in particular
through their contribution to the development of
effective, accountable and transparent institutions that
manage and govern social protection schemes (SDG 16,
particularly target 16.6) and by providing basic income
security and facilitating access to job opportunities and
training for unemployed workers and youth. Many of
the indicators related to strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for
sustainable development (SDG 17) have been promoted
through the development of social protection systems
and floors, with the technical and financial support of
external partners, South–South and Triangular cooperation to share and adapt innovations, the development

of multi-stakeholder partnerships and the development
of national capacities to produce statistical data on
social protection coverage.
Despite significant advances in the extension of
social protection coverage in many parts of the world,
progress in building social protection systems, including social protection floors, is still too slow. If the 2030
Agenda is to be achieved, the national and global efforts
need to be stepped up to fully harness the pivotal role of
social protection systems in promoting social and economic development (ILO, 2014a), more inclusive societies and more effective investments in human capital
and human capabilities, and to promote transformative
change (UNRISD, 2016).

1.2 Progress in building social
protection systems

4

The growing attention to the importance of building
social protection systems in middle- and low-income
countries over the last two or three decades is the latest
chapter of a century-long history of developing such systems. Since the beginning of the 20th century, significant progress has been made: from early steps taken in
a number of pioneer countries, the world has seen social
protection systems develop at an impressive pace. At
present, most countries have in place social protection
schemes anchored in national legislation covering all or
most policy areas of social protection, although in some
cases these cover only a minority of their populations
(see figure 1.1). Despite laudable progress, large gaps
remain in parts of Asia and Africa.
The development of national legislative frameworks
and the extension of legal coverage are an essential
aspect of the development of social protection systems
grounded in human rights (CESCR, 2008; OHCHR,
2012a). However, the extension of legal coverage does
not in itself ensure either the effective coverage of the
population or improvements in the quality and level of
benefits.2 In fact, the extension of effective coverage has
significantly lagged behind that of legal coverage, due to
problems in implementation and enforcement, a lack of
policy coordination, and weak institutional capacities
for the effective delivery of benefits and services. It is

2

therefore essential to monitor legal and effective coverage in parallel, as will be done throughout this report as
far as the available data allow.
Building social protection systems usually follows the
logic of progressive realization with regard to policy areas
covered and population coverage. Countries tend to
build their systems sequentially, depending on their national circumstances and priorities. In many cases, countries first addressed the area of employment injury, then
introduced old-age pensions and disability and survivors’
benefits, followed by sickness, health and maternity coverage. Benefits for children and families, and unemployment benefits, typically came last (see figure 1.2).
When it comes to population coverage, countries
tend to prioritize two major groups at opposite ends of
the income scale, through different mechanisms. On the
one hand, the introduction of contributory mechanisms
(namely social insurance) tends to start with employees in the public and private sectors, particularly those
in stable full-time employment relationships,3 with the
understanding that they should be gradually extended
to other groups of workers. Yet the extension to other
groups of workers, especially to persons in more unstable
forms of wage employment and the self-employed, is not
automatic, as it requires the adaptation of those mechanisms to the needs and circumstances of these groups of
workers, particularly workers with low and irregular
earnings and limited contributory capacities.
On the other hand, countries focus on establishing
non-contributory (mostly tax-financed) mechanisms in
the form of social assistance to cover the needs of people
living in poverty. In many cases, these mechanisms are
targeted to individuals living in extreme poverty and
the most vulnerable, yet often excluding a significant
share of those who are targeted by the programme (Barrientos, 2013; Brown, Ravallion and Van de Walle,
2016; Kidd, Gelders and Bailey-Athias, 2017). In many
cases, such programmes for the poor are short-term,
often in the form of pilot programmes for limited
geographic areas, and lack a stable legal and financial
foundation, which negatively affects their ability to provide predictable and transparent benefits to persons
who need them most and leads to significant coverage gaps. Still, they play an important role in improving the situation of those benefiting from them. Many

For more detail on the concepts of legal and effective coverage and their measurement, see Annex II to this report.
Such employment relationships are also referred to as “standard employment relationships”, which are defined as “full time, indefinite,
as well as part of a subordinate and bilateral employment relationship” (ILO, 2016b, p. 7). In contrast, non-standard forms of employment
include fixed-term contracts and other forms of temporary work, temporary agency work and other contractual arrangements involving
multiple parties, disguised employment relationships, dependent self-employment and part-time work (ILO, 2015a).

working in the informal economy, and in some cases
some of those in the emerging middle class (Schlogl and
Sumner, 2014). The lack of protection for the “missing
middle” constitutes a major obstacle to economic and
social development, as it can trap people in poverty and
thwart their upward mobility. Extending coverage to
everyone through appropriate mechanisms is therefore
a key priority.
It is now widely recognized that social protection
policies contribute to fostering both economic and
social development in the short and the long term
by ensuring that people enjoy income security, have
effective access to health care and other social services,
and are empowered to take advantage of economic opportunities. They play a key role in boosting domestic demand, supporting structural transformation of
national economies, promoting decent work, and fostering inclusive and sustainable growth. While the
contribution of social protection systems to economic
stability and productivity has long been recognized in
high-income countries, their role in fostering economic
and social development was underestimated for a long
time, but is now fully accepted. As a result, an emerging global consensus on the important role of coherent and effective social protection systems is reflected
in the strategic frameworks of major international and
multilateral organizations (e.g. FAO, 2017; ILO, 2012a;

OECD, 2009a; UNICEF, 2012a; WHO, 2010; World
Bank, 2012), aiming at building inclusive and sustainable social protection systems that are closely coordinated with other social and economic policies.
Sustainable and equitable growth cannot be
achieved in the absence of strong social protection policies which guarantee at least a basic level of social security to all in need through a nationally defined social
protection floor, and the progressive extension of the
scope and level of social security coverage. The adoption of the ILO’s Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), constitutes a significant step
forward in the realization of the human right to social
security (UN, 2017a), as it recognizes the triple role
of social security as a universal human right and an
economic and social necessity.4 The Recommendation
reflects the ILO’s two-dimensional extension strategy,
which provides clear guidance on the future development of social security in its 187 member States, by:
• achieving universal protection of the population by
ensuring at least basic levels of income security and
access to essential health care (national social protection floors: horizontal dimension); and
• progressively ensuring wider scope and higher levels
of protection, guided by ILO social security standards (vertical dimension).

1. Introduction

Together with other international standards, the
ILO’s normative framework on social security (see
box 1.2) guides the development and continuous evolution of national social protection systems, including
floors.
During recent years, many countries have significantly extended social protection coverage, reinforced
their social protection systems and established effective
social protection floors. Many countries have achieved
universal or near-universal coverage in different areas
through a combination of non-contributory and contributory schemes and programmes. For example, universal or near-universal coverage in old-age pensions
with at least a basic level of protection has been achieved
by more than 20 countries and territories in all regions,
including, among others, the Plurinational State of
­Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Cabo Verde, China, Georgia, Kosovo, Lesotho, Maldives, Mongolia, Namibia,
Nepal, South Africa, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Trinidad
and Tobago, Ukraine and Zanzibar (United Republic
of Tanzania). For child and maternity benefits, Argentina and Mongolia combine social insurance and social
assistance benefits to achieve universal coverage.5 The
positive impact of the progressive extension of social security coverage on the well-being of the population has
been well documented in multiple countries, such as
Brazil, Cabo Verde, China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Mozambique, South Africa and Thailand, and has contributed, in conjunction with economic, labour market and
employment policies, to fostering economic and social
development and inclusive growth.
Yet, responding to fiscal pressures and a slow recovery after the global crisis, a number of governments
have sought to reduce public spending, thereby curtailing coverage or benefit levels. Such fiscal consolidation6 measures have slowed progress towards the
realization of the human right to social security and
other human rights (Ortiz et al., 2015; OHCHR, 2013)
in many countries, and have constrained the ability of

social protection systems to foster socio-economic recovery. Achieving the SDGs, especially those related to
social protection, will require concerted efforts of national stakeholders, and social dialogue should have a
key role in ensuring that viable and sustainable progress
is made. Effective participation allows for greater transparency and accountability, the sharing of information
and knowledge, and the exchange of opinions, and is
thus one of the prerequisites for ensuring good governance of social protection schemes. Such participation
also resonates with the 2030 Agenda, as reflected particularly in SDGs 16 and 17.
Today, despite important progress in the extension
of social protection, the fundamental human right to
social security remains unfulfilled for the large majority of the world’s population. New ILO estimates
presented in this report show that only 45 per cent of
the world’s population are effectively protected by a
social protection system in at least one area, with significant variations across regions (see figure 1.3).
Despite considerable progress in the extension of coverage, the majority of the global population, 55 per cent,
remain unprotected.
An even more limited share of the global population
has access to comprehensive social protection systems.
The most recent data show that in 2015 only 29 per
cent of the working-age population and their families
had access to such systems. This implies that almost
three-quarters of the global population, or 71 per cent,
do not enjoy access to comprehensive social protection.
Many of those not sufficiently protected live in poverty,
which, despite significant progress, still affects 10.7 per
cent of the global population, or 767 million people
(World Bank, 2016a).7 For many, such lack of protection is often both a cause and a consequence of a lack
of decent employment and of working poverty. Working poverty affected 29.4 per cent of the global labour
force, or 783 million people in 2016 (ILO, 2017a),8 and
many of those affected work in the informal economy.9

The informal economy is understood as the set of all economic activities by workers and economic units that are – in law or in
practice – not covered or insufficiently covered by formal arrangements. Workers in the informal economy are usually covered insufficiently
or not at all by social protection; indeed, the lack of social protection coverage is sometimes used as a criterion by which to identify informal
employment. At the same time, extending social protection coverage to workers in the informal economy helps to address some of the risks
that trap workers in informality (such as the lack of health coverage) and support transitions to formalization, as set out in the Transition
from the Informal to the Formal Economy Recommendation, 2015 (No. 204) (ILO, 2013a, 2017b).

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Box 1.2 The ILO’s normative framework for building social protection systems, including floors

8

Since its establishment in 1919, the ILO has played
a major role in developing an internationally defined
normative framework guiding the establishment, development and maintenance of social security systems across the world, and has become the world’s
leading point of reference for efforts to this end.1
Elaborated and adopted by the Organization’s tripartite constituents – governments, employers’ and
workers’ representatives – of all ILO member States,
and stemming from the Organization’s mandate, the
Conventions and Recommendations that compose
this framework are unique: they establish standards
that States set for themselves, building on good
practices and innovative ways of providing enhanced
and extended social protection in countries from all
regions of the world. At the same time, they are built
on the notion that there is no single perfect model
for social security; on the contrary, it is for each society to develop the best means of guaranteeing the
protection required. Accordingly, they offer a range
of options and flexible routes for their application,
which can be achieved through a combination of
contributory and non-contributory benefits, general and occupational schemes, compulsory and
voluntary insurance, and different methods for the
administration of benefits, all directed at ensuring
an overall level of protection which best responds to
each country’s needs.
Complementing and giving specific form to the
provisions regarding the right to social security in
international human rights instruments, the ILO’s
normative social security framework consists of eight
up-to-date Conventions and Recommendations. The
most prominent instruments are the Social Security
(Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102),
and the Social Protection Floors Recommendation,
2012 (No. 202).2
The long-standing Convention No. 102 brings
­together the nine classical social security contingencies (medical care, sickness, unemployment, old age,
employment injury, family responsibilities, maternity,
invalidity, survivorship) into a single comprehensive
and legally binding instrument.
The recent Recommendation No. 202 provides
guidance on closing social securit y gaps and
achieving universal coverage through the progressive establishment and maintenance of comprehensive social security systems. It calls upon States to
achieve universal coverage with at least minimum

levels of protection through the implementation of
social protection floors as a matter of priority; and
to progressively ensure higher levels of protection. National social protection floors should comprise basic social security guarantees that ensure
effective access to essential health care and basic
income security at a level that allows people to live
in dignity throughout the life cycle. These should
include at least:
• access to essential health care, including maternity care;
• basic income security for children;
• basic income security for persons of working age
who are unable to earn sufficient income, in particular in cases of sickness, unemployment, maternity and disability;
• basic income security for older persons.
Complementing existing standards, Recommendation
No. 202 sets forth an integrated and coherent approach to social protection across the life cycle,
underscores the principle of universality of protection
through nationally defined social protection floors,
and embodies a commitment to their progressive
realization in terms of benefits and people covered.
It thereby aims at ensuring that all members of society enjoy at least a basic level of social security
throughout their lives, ensuring their health and
dignity. Poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion
are established as priority areas of attention, with
the clear objective of reducing poverty as soon as
possible. The Recommendation calls for systems that
are country-led, aligned to national circumstances,
reviewed in the light of population needs, and include
the participation of all stakeholders. In an innovative way, it contains guidance on monitoring to help
countries assess their progress in moving towards
enhanced protection and improving the performance
of national social security systems.
In line with its mandate, under the framework
of the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair
Globalization (2008), and following the guidance
provided in international labour (and particularly social security) standards, the ILO promotes effective
social dialogue in the development and maintenance
of social security systems, including social protection floors. This is usually developed through assessment-based national dialogue (ABND) processes.

The up-to-date ILO social security standards, along with other relevant standards and human rights instruments, are
included in a recently published compendium (ILO, 2017b). 2 Convention No. 102 has been ratified to date by 55 countries, most recently by Argentina (2016), Brazil (2009), Chad (2015), Dominican Republic (2016), Honduras (2012), Jordan
(2014), Romania (2009), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (2015), Ukraine (2016) and Uruguay (2010), and provides
guidance for all 187 ILO member States. ILO Recommendations are not open for ratification.

1.3 Monitoring social protection in the SDGs:
The ILO World Social Protection Database
This report is based on the ILO World Social Protection Database, which provides in-depth country-level
statistics on various dimensions of social security or
social protection systems, including key indicators for
policy-makers, officials of international organizations
and researchers, including the United Nations monitoring of the SDGs (UN, 2017b, 2017c).
Most of the data in the ILO World Social Protection
Database are collected through the ILO Social Security
Inquiry (SSI), an administrative survey regularly submitted to governments, complemented by existing international data. The 2016 edition of the SSI is an update
of the earlier questionnaire, adapted to better reflect
the newly adopted SDGs. The SSI questionnaires and
manual are available online (ILO, 2016c).10 The ILO SSI
is the main source of global data on social protection.
Having published such data since the1940s in
various forms, the ILO World Social Protection
Database complements the data received from the SSI,
as far as possible on a consistent basis, with a number
of other international and regional data sources, notably the International Social Security Association’s
(ISSA) Social Security Observatory and Social Security

Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Social Expenditure (OECD SOCX); the World
Bank pensions and the Atlas of Social Protection Indicators of Resilience and Equity (ASPIRE); and the
World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health

The ILO World Social Protection Database also
draws on national official reports and other sources,
which are usually largely based on administrative data,
and on survey data from a range of sources including
national household income and expenditure surveys,
labour force surveys and demographic and health surveys, to the extent that these include variables on social
protection.

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Since its first edition,13 the World Social Protection
Report has been conceived as a tool to facilitate monitoring of the state of social protection in the world. As an
extensive statistical resource in relation to social protection, it includes a set of detailed tables in the Statistical
Annex (Annex IV)14 to this report, and more on a dedicated website.15 This report is also intended as a contribution to the joint efforts at national and international
level16 to ensure the availability of high-quality social security statistics, not least to support ILO member States
in monitoring and reviewing their social protection
floors and social security systems, so as to ensure their
effectiveness and efficiency in meeting the social protection needs of their populations (UN, 2017c).

1.4 Objective and structure of the report

10

In view of the ambitious progress to be achieved by
2030, this report takes stock of the current state of
social protection systems around the world with regard
to the building of nationally defined social protection
systems, including floors. It provides an assessment of
social protection coverage around the world, highlights
progress in enhancing social protection, identifying remaining coverage gaps, and discusses major challenges
for further progress in realizing the right to social security for all. Accordingly, throughout the report, reference is made to the importance of a rights framework
for social protection systems.
The report also provides a baseline for the monitoring of SDG targets related to social protection, especially SDG indicator 1.3.1. Like the previous edition
(ILO, 2014a), it follows the approach set out in Recommendation No. 202, and is structured in a sequence of
chapters following the life cycle for Chapters 2 to 4,
with health protection being addressed separately in

Chapter 5.17 Chapter 2 focuses on social protection for
children, in particular on child and family benefits, and
addresses also the important complementarity between
cash transfers and care services. Chapter 3 addresses
schemes and programmes ensuring income security for
people of working age, and zooms in on maternity protection (section 3.2), unemployment protection (section 3.3), employment injury protection (section 3.4)
and disability benefits (section 3.5). Chapter 4 focuses
on income security in old age, with a particular emphasis on old-age pensions.18 Chapter 5 addresses the
crucial role of universal health coverage for achieving
the SDGs, with a strong focus on urban–rural inequalities, long-term care and the major employment potential of achieving universal health coverage. Chapter 6 is
devoted to recent trends and developments in the different regions of the world, and Chapter 7 concludes
with the monitoring of social protection at the global
level, including an assessment of challenges and opportunities in extending social protection to all to achieve
the SDGs.
The Annexes to this report include a short glossary of key terms used in the report (Annex I), a description of the methodologies applied (Annex II), a
summary table regarding some of the main minimum
requirements set out in ILO social security standards
(Annex III), and the statistical tables (Annex IV).

The first report in the series was published as the World Social Security Report (ILO, 2010a). The subsequent report was published as
World Social Protection Report (ILO, 2014a) in order to reflect the greater interest in social protection issues in many parts of the world, and
at the international level.
14
The Statistical Annex (Annex IV) to this report includes two sets of tables: tables A.1–A.12 provide key demographic, economic and
social indicators and are available online; tables B.1–B.17, which are more specifically concerned with social protection, are included also in
the printed version. All material is available at http://www.social-protection.org/gimi/gess/ShowTheme.do?tid=3985.

Efforts are under way in the framework of the Social Protection Inter-Agency Coordination Board (SPIAC-B) to strengthen
collaboration between international agencies in the field of social protection statistics and to develop integrated guidance material for
national actors (Bonnet and Tessier, 2013; ILO et al., 2013). This work aims at carrying further the international community’s earlier efforts
to agree on a set of core indicators in the field of social security statistics, as set out in the Resolution concerning the development of social
security statistics adopted by the International Conference of Labour Statisticians in 1957, which continues to provide relevant guidance for
the further development of social security statistics at the national level.

In doing so, both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the extension of social security (ILO, 2012b) are addressed in an integrated
way in each chapter.

KEY MESSAGES
nn
Social protection systems, and in particular social protection floors, play an
important role in lifting children out of poverty and improving their health and
overall well-being; preventing child mortality and improving children’s access to
needed goods and services such as a nutritious diet, health, education, care services; and reducing child labour – thus ensuring that children can realize their full
potential and breaking the vicious cycle of poverty and vulnerability. Additionally,
social protection plays a key role in realizing children’s rights to social security
and an adequate standard of living.
nn
For a vast number of children, these needs are not met. Worldwide, an estimated
5.9 million children under the age of five die every year, most of them from
preventable causes. Nearly half the deaths are attributable to malnutrition; more
than 161 million children under the age of five are stunted. Falling into poverty in
childhood can last a lifetime: even short periods of food deprivation can impact
children’s long-term development. Estimates show that almost half of the world’s
900 million extremely poor population are children.
nn
Effective coverage figures for SDG indicator 1.3.1 show that 35 per cent of children globally receive social protection benefits, with significant regional disparities: while 87 per cent of children in Europe and Central Asia and 66 per cent
in the Americas receive benefits, this is the case for only 28 per cent of children
in Asia and 16 per cent in Africa.
nn
A positive trend is the expansion of cash transfers for children. Countries which
have made great strides towards universal social protection coverage include
Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mongolia. Yet, in many countries, social protection programmes for children struggle with limited coverage, inadequate benefit
levels, fragmentation and weak institutionalization.
nn
Data on social protection expenditure for children aged 0–14 in 139 countries
show that, on average, 1.1 per cent of GDP is spent on child benefits; again
there are large regional disparities, from 0.1 per cent in North Africa and the
Arab States to 2.5 per cent in Europe.
nn
Despite this important progress, a number of countries undergoing fiscal consolidation policies are cutting allowances, often narrow-targeting child benefits
to the poor, excluding vulnerable children from their legitimate right to social
protection. Efforts need to be made so that short-term fiscal adjustment does
not undermine progress.

2.1 Meeting children’s needs through
social protection and realizing
child‑related SDGs

12

Despite marked progress over the past decades, many
families and children in particular still suffer from
poverty, social exclusion and lack of access to necessary
goods and services. For children, lack of access to adequate nutrition, education and healthy environments
is particularly harmful, with the consequence of irreversible damage to their mental and physical development and well-being.
Poverty is multidimensional, and deprivations are
often mutually reinforcing: poor health, malnutrition,
stress, low educational attainment, violence, abuse, neglect, inadequate care, lack of adequate housing, sanitation and drinking water or learning opportunities,
child labour and heavy unpaid care and household work
often overlap (UN, forthcoming). Monetary measures
of poverty do not fully reflect the complex picture of
the multiple deprivations children may face even when
living above a certain monetary threshold.
Children’s rights and needs are addressed across the
2030 Development Agenda through several SDGs, including those on poverty (SDG 1), hunger (SDG 2),
health (SDG 3), education (SDG 4), gender equality
(SDG 5), decent work (SDG 8), inequality (SDG 10),
sustainable cities (SDG 11) and peaceful and inclusive
societies (SDG 16) (UNICEF, 2016a).
Social protection for children is essential for reducing and preventing child poverty, and contributing in
particular to SDG targets 1.2 and 1.3, especially with
regard to ensuring at least a basic level of protection
for all as part of nationally defined social protection
floors. Children make up a disproportionate number of
the world’s extremely poor population: while children
under 18 represent 34 per cent of the total population
in middle- and low-income countries, they constitute 46 per cent of the population living on less than
US$1.90 per day (UNICEF, 2016b). Children growing
up in poverty have fewer opportunities to realize their
full potential, as their life chances are limited compared
to those of their peers. Africa is the region most affected: if current trends continue, it is estimated that in
2030, nine out of ten children in extreme poverty will
live in sub-Saharan Africa (ibid.). Already today, more
than two-thirds of African children experience two
1

or more deprivations of their basic needs (de Milliano
and Plavgo, 2014). Worldwide, an estimated 5.9 million children under the age of five die every year, most
of them from preventable causes.1 Nearly half of these
deaths are attributable to undernutrition. Despite some
progress, malnutrition still affects millions of children: 155 million children under the age of five are
stunted and begin their lives at a marked disadvantage (UNICEF, WHO and World Bank Group, 2017).
Estimates for 2012 show that almost half of the world’s
900 million extremely poor population are children
(UNICEF, 2016b, p. 72). Poverty and vulnerability are
also among the reasons for inadequate nutrition and
food insecurity (SDG targets 2.1 and 2.2). Especially
during the first 1,000 days of a child’s life, that is, from
conception until the age of two years, inadequate nutrition has irreversible devastating effects on physical and
mental development and health. Wasting and stunting
are certainly one of the major concerns in this respect.2
However, child poverty is also a concern in highincome countries. For example, 21.1 per cent of children in the European Union are at risk of poverty,
compared to 16.3 per cent of adults (UNICEF, 2016b).
Since the global financial and economic crisis, child
poverty has been increasing in a number of European
countries including Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain
and Sweden (UNICEF, 2017) due to the compounding effects of low employment rates and austerity cuts
(Cantillon et al., 2017; ILO, 2014a; Ortiz and Cummins, 2012). Children experience vulnerability, poverty
and risks differently from adults. Especially in early
childhood, when the impacts of deprivation are most
severe, they are fully reliant on their carers and without
any means to fend for themselves. Their dependence
on adults also makes them more vulnerable to violence
or other forms of abuse and exploitation such as child
labour, trafficking, child marriage, teenage pregnancy,
and other abusive traditional practices such as female
genital mutilation. Even as teenagers, they are often
voiceless, growing up in traditional legal and cultural
institutions that do not place a high priority on children’s rights and needs.
Social protection systems also play a key role in
promoting gender equality and addressing the gendered division of unpaid care and household work

UNICEF: Child Mortality Estimates, 2015. Available at: www.data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality.
However, SDG target 2.2 includes both overweight and underweight, obesity being a serious concern in high-income countries, with an
average share of 15.3 per cent of children aged 11–15 being overweight in 41 OECD countries (UNICEF, 2016a).

2. Social protection for children

Box 2.1 International standards for child and family benefits
The UN legal framework on human rights contains
a number of provisions spelling out various rights of
children that form part of their right to social protection. These comprise the right to social security,
taking into consideration the resources and the circumstances of the child and persons having responsibility for their maintenance;1 the right to a standard
of living adequate for their health and their wellbeing; and the right to special care and assistance.2
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
(CRC) states that “The States Parties shall recognize
for every child the right to benefit from social security, including social insurance, and shall take the
necessary measures to achieve the full realization
of this right in accordance with their national law”
(Article 26). The ICESCR further requires States to
give the widest possible protection and assistance to
the family, particularly for the care and education of
dependent children.3
ILO social security standards complement this
framework and provide guidance to countries on
how to give effect to the various rights that form part
of the right of children to social protection. The ILO
Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention,
1952 (No. 102), Part VII, sets minimum standards
for the provision of family (or child) benefits in the
form of either a periodic cash benefit or benefits in
kind (food, clothing, housing, holidays or domestic
help) or a combination of both, allocated for the
maintenance of children. The fundamental objective
of family benefits should thus be to ensure the welfare of children and the economic stability of their
families.
A s s p e c i f i e d b y t h e I L O ’s C o m m i t t e e o f
Experts on the Application of Conventions and
Recommendations, these standards require that
family benefits be granted in respect of each child
in the family and to all children, for so long as the
child is receiving education or vocational training on

a full-time basis and is not in receipt of an adequate
income determined by national legislation. They
should be set at a level which relates directly to the
actual cost of providing for a child and should represent a substantial contribution to this cost. Family
allowances at the minimum rate should be granted
regardless of means. Benefits above the minimum
rate may be subject to a means test. Furthermore,
all benefits should be adjusted in order to take into
account changes in the cost of providing for children or in the general cost of living (ILO, 2011a,
paras 184–186).
ILO Recommendation No. 202 further refines
and extends the normative framework, aiming at
universal protection. Income security for children is
one of the basic social security guarantees constituting a national social protection floor, and should
ensure “access to nutrition, education, care and any
other necessary goods and services” (Para. 5(b)).
Although the guarantee should be nationally defined, the Recommendation provides clear guidance on its appropriate level: the minimum level of
income security should allow for life in dignity and
should be sufficient to provide for effective access
to a set of necessary goods and services, such as
may be set out through national poverty lines and
other comparable thresholds (Para. 8(b)). Providing
for universality of protection, the Recommendation
sets out that the basic social security guarantee
should apply to at least all residents, and all children, as defined in national laws and regulations
and subject to existing international obligations
(Para. 6), that is, to the respective provisions of the
CRC, the ICESCR and other relevant instruments.
Representing an approach strongly focused on
outcomes, Recommendation No. 202 allows for a
broad range of policy instruments to achieve income
security for children, including child and family
benefits (the focus of this chapter).

Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 (UDHR), Art. 22; International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, 1966 (ICESCR), Art. 9; UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Art. 26. 2 UDHR, Art. 25(1) and (2).

(SDG target 5.4), which is one of the root causes of
gender inequalities in opportunities and outcomes.
From a young age, girls perform the bulk of unpaid
housework and unpaid care work (Munoz Boudet,
Petesch and Turk, 2012). ILO surveys in 33 countries show that girls aged 7–14 are far more likely than
boys to engage in household chores, which often include looking after younger siblings or adult household members in need of care (ILO, 2016a). This early
gender division of labour follows women into their
adult lives and firmly establishes the unequal division
of household and care work (ibid.). Providing affordable childcare services of good quality would free many

girls from the burden of taking care of their younger
siblings. Realizing children’s rights to social security, an
adequate standard of living, health, education and care,
and achieving the 2030 Agenda will not be possible
without a conducive policy framework that prioritizes
children’s needs and requirements. International standards for child and family benefits (see box 2.1) are an
important component of this policy framework.
In light of the alert regarding child well-being
around the world, social protection policies are powerful
tools to achieve immediate relief for poor children and
their families. Social protection provisions can trigger virtuous cycles of improved income-generating

13

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

capacities of the parents, in cases where households
are engaging in higher-risk, higher-return activities. By
providing a steady, predictable source of income, social
protection benefits enable households to avoid harmful
coping strategies such as pulling children out of school,
cutting spending on food or selling productive assets
when facing a shock. Since children ultimately rely on
their families for maintenance, the range of policies and
policy instruments available to achieve improved income
security and social protection for children is very broad.

2.2 Types of child and family
social protection schemes
Within social protection systems, a broad range of interventions can benefit children and families. Interventions designed specifically to benefit children include:

14

• universal or targeted, conditional or unconditional,
contributory or non-contributory/tax-financed
child or family cash benefits;
• school feeding, vaccination or health programmes
and other in-kind transfers such as free school uniforms or school books;
• exemptions of fees for certain services such as health
care or childcare;
• social security benefits provided to mothers, fathers
and other caregivers during leave of absence from
employment in relation to a dependent child (parental and other childcare leave benefits in case of a sick
child or a child with disabilities);
• childcare services, early childhood education and
education until the minimum age for admission to
employment according to national legislation; and
• tax rebates for families with children.
Focusing on cash benefit programmes for families and
children, figures 2.1 and 2.2 provide an overview of the
different types of periodic cash benefit programmes
around the world. More than one-third (69 countries) of the 186 countries for which data were available do not have any child or family benefit anchored
in national legislation (although social assistance programmes without legal basis, or other programmes contributing to income security for children, may still exist
in these countries). Of the 117 countries with a child/
family benefit scheme, 34 have statutory provisions
only for those in formal employment. The majority of

these countries are in Africa. However, schemes limited
to workers in formal employment are unlikely to reach
the most vulnerable children. A similar number of
countries (37) provide only non-contributory, meanstested benefits. These schemes tend to cover only a small
part of the population and research has shown that
they suffer from large exclusion errors, typically failing to cover the families that are most in need (Kidd,
Gelders and Bailey-Athias, 2017). Fourteen countries
combine employment-related and means-tested noncontributory schemes, and only 32 countries (most of
them in Europe) provide universal non-contributory
child or family cash benefits. However, the achievement of the SDGs, in particular SDG 1 on poverty and
SDG 2 on hunger, but also those on health and education (SDGs 3 and 4), depends on the extent to which
schemes and programmes are able to reach poor and
vulnerable households.
This chapter focuses (as do figures 2.1 and 2.2) on
programmes anchored in national legislation, as these
are usually more stable in terms of funding and institutional frameworks, guarantee coverage as a matter
of right, and provide legal entitlements to eligible individuals and households. In addition to these schemes,
many countries have a variety of programmes providing relief (in cash or in kind) to children in need which
are not (yet) anchored in national legislation, including
pilot or temporary programmes, often limited to certain regions or districts, provided through the government, donors, NGOs or charity organizations.
Figure 2.1 focuses mainly on cash transfers, although a substantial number of interventions consist of benefits in kind, such as school meals or access
to services. School feeding programmes are the most
common form of in-kind benefits: they are provided
in 131 out of 157 countries for which data were available (World Bank, 2015). According to World Food
Programme estimates, at least 368 million children
are fed daily at school (WFP, 2013). School feeding
programmes have a potential to contribute to several
SDGs by improving nutrition (SDG 2), education
(SDG 4), gender equality (SDG 5) and, by purchasing
local foodstuffs, contributing to the economy (SDG 8)
(WFP, 2017).
Social protection cash benefits and effective access
to services are often directly linked and mutually
­reinforcing, particularly with regard to health care,
childcare or education services. These are critical for
overcoming inequalities and fostering social inclusion,
particularly considering that children from low-income
households are significantly less likely to have access to

education and health services (ESCAP, 2015). Other
services also play an important role. For example, birth
registration is an essential service, not only in its own
right but also because it is often a prerequisite to realizing other rights and accessing social protection benefits and services. For adolescents, access to reproductive
health services is a key factor in determining their opportunities in life.
Section 2.5 of this chapter will discuss the complementarity of cash benefits and access to quality child-care services, which play an important role
both in facilitating women’s economic activity in quality employment, thus contributing to reducing child
poverty, and in enabling child development and reducing child labour.

2.3 Effective coverage: Monitoring
SDG indicator 1.3.1 for children
As elaborated above, a wide range of interventions can
have a positive impact on child well-being, but the
growth in non-contributory cash transfer programmes

in low- and middle-income countries over the past
two decades merits particular attention (Bastagli et
al., 2016). Some 130 countries now have at least one
non-contributory unconditional cash transfer programme. However, coverage and benefit levels often
remain limited. For example, while 40 out of 48 African countries have adopted such programmes (Cirillo
and Tebaldi, 2016), figure 2.3 illustrates that coverage
of children receiving child cash benefit still remains low
in sub-Saharan Africa – only an estimated 13.1 per cent
are covered, substantially lower than the world average
of 34.9 per cent. As the figure shows, coverage rates
vary significantly across regions and subregions: highincome countries such as Australia, Canada and New
Zealand, as well as countries in Northern and Western Europe, achieve high coverage rates (above 95 per
cent). Some high- and middle-income countries in Eastern and Southern Europe cover more than 85 per cent
of children, and Latin American countries on average
more than 70 per cent, whereas this figure is only
29 per cent in Central America. Coverage in Asia varies
between 10.8 per cent in Eastern Asia and 43.9 per cent
in Central Asia. The average coverage rate of 65.5 per

Box 2.2 Universal child benefits in Mongolia
In 2005, the Government of Mongolia introduced
the Child Money Programme (CMP), a conditional,
poverty-targeted cash transfer with the aim of alleviating poverty in the wake of the economic and
social transition. The conditions included social and
health behaviour as well as schooling requirements.
Implementation encountered targeting problems of
leakage to the non-poor and exclusion of the poor
(Hodges et al., 2007). In July 2006 the Government
converted the programme into a universal scheme
providing a benefit to all children under the age of
18 and at the same time introduced a new benefit
for newborn children and increased the amount of
the benefit. A study by Hodges et al. (2007) found
that the initial targeted CMP reduced the child
poverty headcount by almost 4 percentage points
(from 42.2 to 38.5 per cent) and lowered the child
poverty gap by about 2 percentage points, assuming
that the child benefits received had raised actual
household expenditure by an equivalent amount.
The universal child benefit, and especially the increased amount of the benefit introduced in 2006,
reduced the headcount by 10 percentage points (to
27.4 per cent) and cut the poverty gap by 5.5 percentage points (to 7.1 per cent).
In 2010 the CMP was discontinued following a reform of the social welfare system. In October 2012,
the country’s new parliament reintroduced the CMP

following the adoption of the Government Action
Plan (2012–2016) which highlighted the government’s social welfare commitments. The benefit was
universal and provided for all children until the age
of 18. The 2014 Household Socio-Economic Survey
found that the CMP contributed to a reduction of the
poverty incidence by 12 per cent and the poverty
gap by 21 per cent. It thus significantly reduced
monetary poverty and even more so if only children
were considered (ILO, 2016d).
In August 2016, the newly elected Government announced the reintroduction of targeting with respect
to the CMP. As a consequence, only 60 per cent of
children received the CMP in November 2016. The
subsequently approved IMF three-year loan arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility imposes
conditions with regard to fiscal consolidation which
include “steps to strengthen and better target the social safety net” (IMF, 2017a). However, in July 2017,
witnessing an improvement in the fiscal indicators,
the Government re-established the universality feature of the CMP and integrated the programme in
the Law on Social Welfare. In such a volatile context, the ratification of the Social Security (Minimum
Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), would provide the safeguard for sustaining Mongolia’s social
protection system, including the universal Child
Money Programme.

impacts are substantially larger for universal benefits,
as targeted programmes typically suffer from substantial inclusion and exclusion errors (Kidd, Gelders and

such as Argentina (see box 2.3), Brazil and Chile, combine different schemes to reach universal coverage.

with coverage rates of above 99 per cent and the remaining countries which cover only about 14 per cent

benefit levels, eligibility criteria, enrolment procedures
and overall administrative efficiency. A key question is
often whether programmes should be targeted to poor

Box 2.3 Reaching universal social protection for children through a combination of schemes:
The case of Argentina
Argentina is progressing towards universal child
benefit coverage through a combination of measures. In addition to the existing contributory family
allowances (CFA) and tax deductions available for
higher-income workers with children, in 2009 it introduced the Universal Child Allowance (UCA) in
response to the effects of the global crisis, and with
the aim of consolidating several non-contributory
transfer programmes for families with children.
Through the UCA, child benefits were extended to
families of unemployed workers, informal workers,
domestic workers and self-employed workers participating in the simplified tax and contribution payment
regime for small-scale contributors (monotributo).
The semi-conditional UCA scheme provides benefits
for children up to the age of 18 (no age limit if disabled), and up to five children per family, provided
that beneficiaries fulfil certain health (such as vaccination for children under the age of five years, etc.)
and educational (school attendance) requirements.

The three components of the family benefit programme in 2014 reached 84.6 per cent of the children and adolescents under the age of 18. While the
CFA and tax deduction scheme together benefited
53.3 per cent of this population, the UCA scheme
provided benefits to 46.8 per cent of that same
population. Together, these benefits accounted for
about 1.04 per cent of GDP, with the UCA ­accounting
for 0.50 per cent.
An assessment of the impact on indigence and
poverty of the family transfers for children concluded that indigence would be reduced by approximately 65 per cent and overall poverty by 18 per
cent (Bertranou and Maurizio, 2012). According to
this study, the UCA covers 70 per cent of poor children and adolescents; together with the contributory
and the non-contributory benefits approximately
80 per cent of children are pulled out of poverty.

2.4 Expenditure on social protection
for children
Ensuring adequate social protection requires allocating sufficient resources for children and families. Yet,
at present, countries spend on average only 1.1 per
cent of GDP on social protection for children (excluding health expenditure), and the amounts vary greatly
across countries and regions, as shown in figure 2.4.
While Europe and Central Asia, as well as Oceania,
spend more than 2 per cent of GDP on child benefits, expenditure ratios remain well below 1 per cent
of GDP in most other parts of the world. Regional
estimates for Africa, the Arab States, and Southern
and South-Eastern Asia show expenditure levels of less
than 0.7 per cent of GDP, although children represent
a greater share of their population. Expenditure levels
in sub-Saharan Africa seem particularly low considering that 43 per cent of its population are children
aged 0–14.
The high levels of child poverty and other pertinent
indicators, including child mortality as well as undernutrition and malnutrition, discussed above, clearly indicate that the level of resources allocated to child social
protection is insufficient. This is true even when considering that other public expenditures on education,
health care or social protection measures other than
child and family benefits also contribute to improving
the situation of children. The low expenditure levels in
low-income and lower-middle-income countries, with
many countries not providing any benefits for children,

are particularly worrisome as this jeopardizes future
development potential. It is unlikely that the child-related SDGs discussed above can be met if the resources
invested in the social protection of children are not
stepped up.

2.5 The complementary role of cash benefits
and childcare services
The availability to both women and men of adequate
parental and childcare leave benefits (including in case
of children with illnesses and disabilities), childcare
services and early childhood education are essential
in guaranteeing the income security and well-being
of children. Measures adopted by employers to facilitate sharing work and family responsibilities for parents with children also play a key role (ILO, 2016a).
This package of measures is particularly important with
a view to facilitating the productive economic activity of women and simultaneously promoting an equal
distribution of unpaid care work of children between
women and men. Both aspects are essential in breaking the cycle of gender inequalities which trap women
in informal, low-paid jobs without any social protection for themselves both in working and old age (Alfers,
2016; Moussié, 2016). Another important factor for
children’s and women’s well-being is maternity benefits (see section 3.2). Currently, 134 countries invest
public resources in childcare for children before they
enter primary school. Companies have also realized

2. Social protection for children

the benefits of providing childcare facilities, reporting
reduced absenteeism, staff turnover and work injuries
while increasing the daily outputs of female workers
(ILO, 2016a; UN, 2016a).
Having to reconcile unpaid care work with the imperative to generate income often pushes women into
the most vulnerable forms of non-standard employment and informal work. This is detrimental both for
the women at work and for the children not being adequately taken care of – across 53 developing countries,
an estimated 35.5 million children under five are left
without adult supervision for at least one hour a day
(Samman, Presler-Marshall and Jones, 2016). It is often
the older siblings who take care of younger ones, which
means that they are not able to attend school. In other
cases, women workers, including street vendors, agricultural workers, waste pickers, domestic workers or
porters take their children along while working, compromising their own income security and productivity
as well as providing unsafe or suboptimal environments
for the child. In general, heavy and unequal care responsibilities affect livelihood strategies, employment
outcomes, economic growth, and sustainable poverty reduction, thus influencing progress on the SDGs related
to poverty (SDG 1), inequality (SDG 10), gender equality (SDG 5) and decent work (SDG 8). By contrast, investing in quality childcare, early childhood education
with feeding programmes, and adequate childcare leave
benefits for both women and men, increases women’s
labour force participation, generates jobs, improves child
development and educational attainments and enables
older siblings to attend school (ILO, 2016a).

2.6 Universal social protection to promote
well-being of children and families
The extension of both effective and legal coverage for
children is a welcome global trend. While universality is generally a trait of high-income countries, several
developing countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile
and Mongolia have also achieved universal or nearuniversal social protection coverage for children, and
many others are expanding coverage fast, such as the
Plurinational State of Bolivia, South Africa and Uruguay (see Chapter 6). Year after year governments announce social protection cash transfers for children in
all regions (table 2.1). However, despite this important
progress, a number of countries undergoing fiscal consolidation policies are cutting allowances, often narrow-targeting child benefits to the poor, excluding

vulnerable children from their legitimate right to social
protection. A number of newly announced adjustment
measures can also be found in table 2.1. Efforts need to
be made so that short-term fiscal adjustment does not
undermine progress.
Many short-term adjustment reforms have focused
on expenditure cuts to non-contributory schemes and
programmes, such as cash transfers for children and
families. As a result, child poverty has increased in
Europe (Cantillon et al., 2017; UNICEF, 2017), and
unless these measures are reconsidered, child vulnerability is also likely to increase in developing countries.
Ill-designed austerity or fiscal consolidation measures
threaten not only children’s right to social security
(CRC, Article 26), but also the rights to food, health,
education, and other essential goods and services (UN,
2011). It is important that short-term adjustments do
not undermine long-term gains; there are alternatives
(Ortiz et al., 2015) and policy options need to be considered to support children’s well-being.
Because of the direct link between child well-being
and the socio-economic condition of the household
where they live, social protection mechanisms, even
those not oriented explicitly towards children, such as
an old-age pension or income from public works programmes, can improve a household’s ability to care
for its children and to access essential services (ILO,
2013b). Social protection interventions benefit children
along several dimensions. Many studies have found that
social protection schemes such as family allowances,
social pensions, parental and childcare leave benefits
(especially when both women and men take them up),
school feeding programmes, childcare programmes and
early childhood education, have positive impacts on
poverty, child nutrition, school attendance, school performance, health status and child labour (Bastagli et al.,
2016; ILO, 2016a, 2013b). Cash transfers also improve
access to services, in particular health services. Research
has also shown that design and implementation arrangements matter. In order to maximize the impact
on children, all social protection interventions should
respect the principles anchored in the Joint Statement
on Advancing Child-sensitive Social Protection issued
in 2009 by a coalition of UN agencies, bilateral donor
agencies and international NGOs (see box 2.4).
Certain global trends exacerbate the vulnerable
situation of children, sometimes reversing development gains of the past. This is the case, for example, in
the Middle East and North Africa and other areas afflicted by conflict. Climate change, environmental degradation, natural disasters such as droughts or floods,

urbanization and migration are additional factors that
have an impact on child well-being and increase the
need for social protection.
Currently, nearly 160 million children live in areas
of high or extremely high drought severity, most of
them in Africa and Asia, and more than half a billion
children live in zones with extremely high flood occurrence, mainly in Asia (UNICEF, 2015a, p. 11). Climate
change increases the frequency of crises such as floods,
droughts, heatwaves and other extreme weather phenomena. Children are particularly vulnerable to the
consequences of these crises, which include crop failure and loss of livelihoods, dysfunctional water systems
and contaminated water reserves leading to outbreaks
of vector-borne and food-borne diseases and food

insecurity. The effects for children are detrimental: untreated undernutrition during the first two years of life
can lead to irreversible stunting. Diarrhoeal diseases
are a major cause of under-five mortality. Global warming may also affect the spread of temperature-sensitive
diseases such as malaria, cholera, meningococcal meningitis, dengue fever or lyme disease (ibid.). Warmer
temperatures may also allow malaria and other diseases
to move into regions that were not previously affected
by “tropical” diseases. Emergency relief operations as
well as health systems and other infrastructure need
to be strengthened and designed in such a way as to be
able to cope with such emergency situations.
Poor families will be hit hardest by disasters, as their
abilities to cope with these risks are more limited. The

Box 2.4 Child-sensitive social protection
The Joint Statement on Advancing Child-sensitive
Social Protection (DfID et al., 2009) sets out that
the design, implementation and evaluation of child-­
sensitive social protection programmes should aim to:
• avoid adverse impacts on children, and reduce or
mitigate social and economic risks that directly affect children’s lives;
• intervene as early as possible where children are
at risk, in order to prevent irreversible impairment
or harm;
• consider the age and gender-specific risks and
vulnerabilities of children throughout the life cycle;
• mitigate the effects of shocks, exclusion and
poverty on families, recognizing that families raising
children need support to ensure equal opportunity;
• make special provision to reach children who are
particularly vulnerable and excluded, including
children without parental care, and those who are

marginalized within their families or communities
due to their gender, disability, ethnicity, HIV and
AIDS, or other factors;
• consider the mechanisms and intra-household dynamics that may affect how children are reached,
paying particular attention to the balance of power
between men and women within the household
and broader community; and
• include the voices and opinions of children, their
care-givers and youth in the understanding and
design of social protection systems and programmes.
The Joint Statement was issued by the UK Department for International Development (DfID), HelpAge
International, Hope & Homes for Children, Institute
of Development Studies, ILO, Overseas Development Institute (ODI), Save the Children UK, UNDP,
UNICEF and the World Bank.

poor are often the first having to use to unsafe water
sources and unsafe food, to skip meals or to pull children out of school. Children of indigenous peoples and
those living in ethnic minority households are at even
greater risk of suffering from poverty along multiple
dimensions: they are less likely to attend school, and
among indigenous children there are disproportionate instances of child labour as well as higher levels of
income poverty (ILO, 2017c).
One coping strategy in the case of humanitarian crisis – whether arising from conflicts or natural
disasters – is to migrate, either internally or to other
countries. Over the past decades, both the number of
disasters and the related population displacements and

migration have grown continuously. Children are often
particularly affected by displacements, due not only
to the abovementioned physical health risks but also
because family can be separated during the displacement and because migration can be dangerous, causing not only physical but also mental disorders such as
post-traumatic stress disorder. While no data are available yet for the most recent wave of migration, research
on earlier generations shows that children growing up
in immigrant households in European countries are
consistently at a higher risk of income poverty, interrupted school biographies and early dropout, which
also negatively affect their entrance into the labour
market (Bruckauf, Chzhen and Toczydlowska, 2016).

3.1 Introduction: The quest for income security
KEY MESSAGES
nn
Social protection plays a key role in ensuring income security for women and
men of working age, which is an essential component of the well-being of individuals and families, and for the achievement of the SDGs, including SDG 1.3
and SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth.
nn
While the labour market serves as the primary source of income security during
working life, social protection plays a major role in smoothing incomes and aggregate demand, as well as in protecting and enhancing human capital and human
capabilities, thereby facilitating structural change within economies and contributing to inclusive growth.
nn
By ensuring income security in the event of unemployment, employment injury,
disability, sickness and maternity, as well as insufficient earnings or other needs,
social protection systems support women, men and their families in coping with
the financial consequences of life events, to find and sustain decent and productive employment and facilitate effective access to health care and other
services.
nn
Globally, 3.2 per cent of GDP is allocated to non-health public social protection expenditure ensuring income security during working age; regionally, levels
vary widely, ranging from 0.6 per cent in South-Eastern Asia to 6.6 per cent in
Western Europe.
nn
Worldwide, only 21.8 per cent of unemployed workers have access to unemployment benefits, and only a minority of the global labour force is protected
in case of employment injury. New estimates also show that 27.8 per cent of
persons with severe disabilities actually receive disability benefits and 41.1 per
cent of childbearing women receive a maternity benefit, with large differences
across regions.
nn
Trends reflect progress in the extension of social protection for women and
men of working age, with a number of developing countries achieving universal
effective coverage in maternity protection (Ukraine, Uruguay) and disability
benefits (Brazil, Chile, Mongolia and Uruguay).
nn
Social protection systems, including floors, can operate in the most effective
and sustainable way if well-coordinated with employment, labour market, wage
and tax policies.

ocial protection plays a key role in ensuring income
security for women and men of working age,1
which is an essential component of the well-being of
individuals and families, and for the achievement of the
SDGs, including SDG 8 on decent work and economic
growth.
The majority of people of working age are economically active, and generally gain their livelihoods
through income-generating activity, whether in formal
or informal employment, and whether such activity can
be categorized as decent work 2 or not. Whether currently economically active or not, persons of working
age have specific social protection needs. Effective policies to meet these needs are key not only to realizing
their right to social security, but also to ensure the efficient functioning of labour markets and broader economic and social development. Needs generally fall into
three broad categories:

24

• the need to replace income lost temporarily or permanently as a result of unemployment, employment
injury, disability, sickness or maternity;
• the need for income support or other social protection measures where income is insufficient to avoid
poverty and/or social exclusion; and
• the need for support to restore earning capacity after
any of the contingencies listed above and to facilitate participation in employment.
Most people seek income security during their working
life in the first instance through participation in the
labour market. Income security is strongly dependent
on the level, distribution and stability of earnings and
other income from work, and is therefore significantly
influenced by policy choices and the adoption and enforcement of legislation in a number of areas. Policy
areas particularly relevant to income security include
labour market and employment policies, employment
protection, wages (including minimum wages) and collective bargaining, and active labour market policies,

1

as well as policies to support workers with family and
care responsibilities and to promote gender equality in
employment. Effective policy and legal frameworks in
these areas are key to ensuring decent work. However,
recent labour market and employment trends, such as
higher unemployment, underemployment and more
prevalent precarious and informal employment, as well
as dwindling real wages and rising working poverty,
have increased the pressure on social protection systems to ensure income security for persons of working
age (ILO, 2016b, 2016e, 2017a; Berg, 2015a).
In light of these observations, it is very clear that
income security cannot be achieved by social protection
systems alone. Social protection policies need to be coordinated with well-designed policies to address these
challenges in the fields of employment, labour market
and wages, with a view to alleviating excessive burdens
on national social protection systems and allowing
them to work more efficiently and more effectively.
This is also the approach adopted in Recommendation No. 202, which insists that national social protection floors should guarantee, at a minimum, “basic
income security, at least at a nationally defined minimum level, for persons in active age who are unable to
earn sufficient income, in particular in cases of sickness,
unemployment, maternity and disability” (Para. 5(c)).
While highlighting links to other policy areas, it also
emphasizes country responsibility to implement the
most effective and efficient combination of benefits and
schemes in the national context, which may include universal benefit schemes, social insurance schemes, social
assistance schemes, negative income tax schemes, public
employment schemes and employment support schemes.
Most contributory schemes cover those people (and their
dependants) who have been economically active in the
past, but have lost their income from work either permanently or temporarily owing to loss of their current job
(unemployment benefits), sickness, longer-term severe
disability or death resulting from a work-related accident
or disease (employment injury benefits), circumstances

Working age is broadly defined here as the age range during which most people are, or seek to be, economically active, reflecting the
life-cycle approach of the Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), and being aware that in many contexts women and
men continue to be economically active, out of choice or necessity, until well into old age (see Chapter 4). The upper and lower boundaries of
“working age” are highly dependent on national contexts, as defined by national legislation and practice, and often depend on the length of
time that people spend in education and statutory pensionable ages. For the purpose of the comparability of statistical indicators, this report
follows established international practice in using an age range of 15–64 years, but this is not to imply that all individuals within this age
range can or should conform to a specific notion of “work” or “activity”.
2
Decent work has been defined by the ILO and endorsed by the international community as productive work for women and men in
conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. Decent work involves opportunities for work that is productive and delivers
a fair income; provides security in the workplace and social protection for workers and their families; offers better prospects for personal
development and encourages social integration; gives people the freedom to express their concerns, to organize and to participate in
decisions that affect their lives; and guarantees equal opportunities and equal treatment for all.

not directly related to work (general sickness, disability and survivors’ benefits) or pregnancy, childbirth and
family responsibilities (maternity, paternity or parental
benefits, child or family benefits).
However, these types of programme often do not
cover the situations and needs of people (and their
dependants) who are economically active but not in
formal employment, or are inadequately covered; whose
income from employment is too low to prevent them
and their families from falling into poverty (working
poor); or who simply have no income at all, having been
unemployed or underemployed for too long to qualify for benefits, with no prospect of such a situation
coming to an end, even in the long term (ILO, 2016b,
2013a). For these groups especially, non-contributory
schemes and programmes are essential to close gaps in
coverage and to secure at least a basic level of protection; yet in many cases, particularly in low- and middleincome countries, the available programmes struggle
with limited coverage, inadequate benefit levels and
weak institutional capacities, as well as insufficient and
unstable funding. As a result, the majority of people of
working age in those countries lack social protection
coverage that would protect their fragile livelihoods as
workers and entrepreneurs, and enable them to move
out of poverty and vulnerability in a sustainable way
(Behrendt, 2017; ILO, 2011b).

While this chapter will focus mainly on cash benefits, it should be noted that benefits in kind, in particular health care and other social services, play a major
role in ensuring income security for people of working age. The role of health-care provision (see Chapter 5 for more detail) is particularly important in this
respect: people who enjoy effective access to quality public health services or are financially protected
through affordable (social) health insurance will have
higher income security than those at risk of having to
pay high out-of-pocket costs for health care in times of
need. The provision of other social services and related
benefits in kind that have a monetary value, including
education and care services, can also markedly reduce
people’s income needs. The provision of services such as
employment services, skills development programmes,
childcare facilities and long-term care services may also
have an impact on people’s ability to engage in paid
employment, with significant implications for income
security, particularly for women (Martinez Franzoni
and Sánchez-Ancochea, 2015).
Worldwide, about one-third of total non-health
public social protection expenditure, amounting to
3.2 per cent of GDP, is spent on benefits for people of
working age (see figures 3.1 and 3.2).3 These include
maternity benefits, unemployment benefits, employment injury benefits, disability benefits, and general

3
This also includes expenditure on general social assistance programmes, which accounts for 0.8 per cent of GDP worldwide (2.7 per cent
in Latin America).

social assistance. Within this overall figure regional
variations are significant, ranging from 0.6 per cent
in South-Eastern Asia and 0.7 per cent in Arab States
to 6.6 per cent in Northern, Southern and Western
Europe. While non-health public social protection expenditure for people of working age accounts for close
to one-third of overall non-health social protection expenditure in Western Europe, it amounts to roughly
half of this category of expenditure in Latin America
and the Middle East. In Africa, such expenditure accounts for about one-quarter of total non-health social
protection expenditure, a lower proportion which can
only partly be explained by a smaller share of workingage population in total population, but is also associated with the relatively weak attention given to the
development of social protection programmes for persons of working age.
The remainder of this chapter is divided into four
sections, dealing respectively with the areas of social

security that are most relevant to people of working
age, namely:
• maternity protection (section 3.2);
• unemployment protection (section 3.3);
• employment injury protection (section 3.4); and
• disability benefits (section 3.5).
Under each of these sub-chapters, both contributory
and non-contributory schemes are discussed, taking
into account that universal coverage is often achieved
through a combination of different types of schemes,
so as to allow the extension of social protection coverage to those with no or weak contributory capacities. Access to health and sickness benefits, which also
have important implications for income security during
working age, is discussed in Chapter 5. Together, these
schemes contribute to building national social protection systems, including floors.

3.2 Maternity protection
KEY MESSAGES
nn
Maternity protection is a key component of the transformative policies called for in the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development and is essential to the achievement of multiple Sustainable Development Goals, including Goals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10.
nn
Maternity protection ensures income security for pregnant women and mothers of newborn children
and their families, and also effective access to quality maternal and child health care. It also promotes equality in employment and occupation.
nn
Worldwide, 45 per cent of women in employment are covered by law under mandatory maternity
cash benefit schemes, with large regional variation.
nn
New effective coverage estimates for SDG indicator 1.3.1 show that only 41.1 per cent of women with
newborns worldwide receive a maternity benefit, and only 15.8 per cent of childbearing women in
Africa. Such lack of income security during the final stages of pregnancy and after childbirth forces
many women, especially those in the informal economy, to keep working into the very late stages of
pregnancy and/or to return to work prematurely, thereby exposing themselves and their children to
significant health risks.
nn
Extending paid maternity leave provisions and non-contributory maternity cash benefits is an important means of improving income security and access to maternal and child health care for pregnant women and new mothers, particularly for women living in poverty.
nn
Universal effective maternity coverage has been achieved in Ukraine and Uruguay, and other developing countries such as Argentina, Colombia, Mongolia and South Africa have made substantial progress. However, significant coverage and adequacy gaps remain in other parts of the world. Ensuring
universal access to quality maternal health care should be a priority, especially in countries where
the informal economy accounts for a large proportion of employment.
nn
Adequate maternity protection, as well as paid paternity and parental leave, recognize that both
mothers and fathers have responsibilities as breadwinners and caregivers, and contribute to achieving
a more equitable sharing of care responsibilities, in line with SDG target 5.4 on gender equality.

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

3.2.1  Maternity protection and the SDGs

28

Maternity protection is an essential ingredient of policies to prevent and reduce poverty and vulnerability,
promote the health, nutrition and well-being of mothers and their children, achieve gender equality at
work, and advance decent work for both women and
men. While significant progress has been achieved,
not least through the attention provided to maternal
and child health under the Millennium Development
Goals (4 and 5), it is estimated that in 2015 more than
830 women died every day due to complications during
pregnancy or childbirth (WHO, 2017).
Given the significant existing gaps and challenges
faced by women, including poverty, inequality and
access to health of mothers and children, gender-responsive social protection commitments continue to be
reflected in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals,
particularly with respect to ending poverty (SDG 1),
improving nutrition and ending hunger (SDG 2), reducing maternal and infant mortality (SDG 3), ensuring access to education (SDG 4), achieving gender
equality and empowering women (SDG 5), promoting
inclusive growth and decent work (SDG 8) and reducing inequalities (SDG 10). From a social protection
perspective, ensuring income security in the critical
period before and after childbirth, and access to maternal health care, are essential (ILO, 2010b; 2014c).
Maternity cash benefits that fully or partially replace
women’s earnings during the final stages of pregnancy
and after childbirth, or ensure at least a basic level of
income, are of critical importance for the well-being of
pregnant women, new mothers and their families. The
absence of income security during the final stages of
pregnancy and after childbirth forces many women, especially those in the informal economy, to keep working
into the very late stages of pregnancy and/or to return
to work prematurely, thereby exposing themselves and
their children to significant health risks. Women in the
informal economy are particularly vulnerable to the
risks of income insecurity and ill health because of discrimination, unsafe and insecurity working conditions,
often low and volatile incomes with limited access to
freedom of association, and lack of representation in collective bargaining processes (ILO, 2016a).
Another fundamental component of maternity protection is maternal health care, namely effective access
to adequate medical care and services during pregnancy

4

and childbirth, and beyond, to ensure the health of
both mothers and children. As with health care in general (see Chapter 5), a lack of effective access to maternal health-care coverage not only puts the health of
women and children at risk, but also exposes families to
significantly increased risk of poverty.
According to ILO standards (see box 3.1), maternity
protection includes not only income security and access
to health care, but also the right to interrupt work activities, rest and recover around childbirth. It ensures the
protection of women’s rights at work during maternity
and beyond, through measures that prevent risks, protect women from unhealthy and unsafe working conditions and environments, safeguard employment, protect
against discrimination and dismissals, and allow them
to return to their jobs after maternity leave under conditions that take into account their specific circumstances, including breastfeeding (ILO, 2010b; 2014a;
2014b). Thus also from a perspective of equality of opportunity and treatment between women and men,
maternity protection takes into account the particular
circumstances and needs of women, enabling them to
be productive members of society and at the same time
to raise families (ILO, 2014c, 2016a). Adequate provision for paid paternity leave and parental leave is an important corollary to maternity protection policies, and
contributes to a more equal sharing of family responsibilities (ILO, 2016a, 2014b).
3.2.2  Types of maternity protection schemes
Maternity cash benefits are provided through collectively financed mechanisms – social insurance, universal benefits or social assistance schemes – anchored
in national social security legislation in 141 out of the
192 countries for which information was available (see
figure 3.3). Social insurance schemes form the vast majority of these programmes, prevailing in 138 countries,
of which seven also operate social assistance schemes.4
Around 50 other countries – most of them in Africa or
Asia – have provisions in their labour legislation setting
out a mandatory period of maternity leave and establishing the employer’s liability for the payment of the
woman’s salary (or a percentage thereof) during that
period (see box 3.2). Three countries allow women to
take unpaid maternity leave without providing in the
law for the replacement of their earned income.

For more detailed characteristics of the schemes in place, see also Annex IV, table B.5.

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.1  International standards relevant to maternity protection
Maternity protection has long been regarded by the
international community as an essential prerequisite
for the achievement of women’s rights and gender
equality. Women’s right to maternity protection is
enshrined in a number of major human rights instruments. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
1948, notably states that motherhood and childhood
are entitled to special care and assistance, as well
as to social security. The International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966, establishes the right of mothers to special protection during
a reasonable period before and after childbirth,
including paid leave or leave with adequate social
security benefits. The Convention for the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 1979,
recommends that special measures be taken to ensure maternity protection, proclaimed as an essential
right permeating all areas of the Convention.
The ILO has led the establishment of international
standards on maternity protection, adopting the
first international standard on this subject in the
very year of its foundation: the Maternity Protection
Convention, 1919 (No. 3). Since then, a number of
more progressive instruments have been adopted
in line with the steady increase in women’s participation in the labour market in most countries worldwide. The current ILO maternity protection standards
provide detailed guidance for national policy-making
and action to enable women to successfully combine their reproductive and productive roles. To
this end, the standards aim to ensure that women
benefit from adequate maternity leave, income and
health protection measures, that they do not suffer
discrimination on maternity-related grounds, that
they enjoy the right to nursing breaks and that they
are not required to perform work prejudicial to their
health or that of their child. In order to protect the
situation of women in the labour market, ILO maternity protection standards specifically require that
cash benefits be provided through schemes based
on solidarity and risk-pooling, such as compulsory
social insurance or public funds, while strictly circumscribing the potential liability of employers for
the direct cost of benefits. At the same time, the
relevant standards aim at ensuring that women have
access to adequate maternal health care and services during pregnancy and childbirth, and beyond.
The S o cial S e curit y (Minimum S t andards)
Convention, 1952 (No. 102), Part VIII, sets minimum

Most maternity cash benefit schemes and employer
liability provisions cover only women in formal employment, in particular those complying with the qualifying
conditions set out in contributory schemes. These criteria often place workers with discontinued contributions
or low contributory capacity at a disadvantage, in particular self-employed, part-time workers and those in
other non-standard forms of employment. For instance,

standards as to the population coverage of maternity
protection schemes and for the provision of cash
benefits during maternity leave, to address the suspension of earnings during this time (see Annex III,
table AIII.7). The Convention also defines the medical care that must be provided free of charge at all
stages of maternity, as required to maintain, restore
or improve the health of the women protected and
their ability to work, and to attend their personal
needs. Maternal health care must be available not
only to the women participating in a maternity protection scheme, but also to the wives of men covered by such schemes, at no cost to either.
The Maternit y Protection Convention, 20 0 0
(No. 183), and its accompanying Recommendation
(No. 191), are the most up-to-date ILO standards
on maternity protection. They set higher and more
comprehensive standards on population coverage,
health protection, maternity leave and leave in
case of illness or complications, cash benefits,
employment protection and non-discrimination, as
well as breastfeeding.
Recommendation No. 202 calls for such benefits
to be provided as part of the basic social security
guarantees that make up social protection floors.
These include access to essential health care,
including maternity care, comprising a set of necessary goods and services, and basic income
security for persons of active age who are unable
to earn sufficient income due, inter alia, to maternity. Maternity medical care should meet criteria of
availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality
(CESCR, 2000); it should be free for the most vulnerable; and conditions of access should not be such
as to create hardship or increase the risk of poverty
for people in need of health care. Cash benefits
should be suf ficient to allow women and their
children a life in dignity, out of poverty. Maternity
benefits should be granted at least to all residents,
with the objective of achieving universal protection.
The call to progressively extend maternity protection to all workers in the informal economy is further
highlighted in the Transition from the Informal to the
Formal Economy Recommendation, 2015 (No. 204).
A variety of schemes can be used to achieve such
coverage, including universal schemes, social insurance, social assistance and other social transfers,
and providing benefits in cash or in kind.

in some countries social security contributions are set
at a fixed rate (often around 20 per cent) of a reference
basic wage, which is usually higher than the average
income of self-employed workers (ILO, forthcoming a).
As a result, many women in both the formal and informal economy who are not deemed eligible for these
programmes, or are unable to comply with these conditions, find themselves without any support.

Note: In the United States there is no national programme. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 1993, maternity leave is unpaid as a general
rule; however, subject to certain conditions accrued paid leave (such as vacation leave, personal leave, medical or sick leave, or paid medical
leave) may be used to cover some or all of the leave to which a woman is entitled under the Act. A cash benefit may be provided at the state level.
Additionally, employers may offer paid maternity leave as a job benefit. Figures in brackets refer to the number of countries in each category.

Some women in informal employment can benefit
from non-contributory benefits, such as cash transfer programmes aimed at enhancing nutrition and
health outcomes for pregnant women, young mothers and their children. These benefits, however, tend

to be targeted towards the most vulnerable and often
come with strict behavioural conditions and tend to
operate within the traditional division of paid work
and unpaid household work and care responsibilities
between women and men (ILO, 2016a, 2016f).

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.2  Maternity protection: Collectively financed schemes vs employer’s liability provisions
Maternity cash benefits can be provided by different types of schemes: contributory (e.g. social
insurance), non-contributory, usually tax-financed
(e.g. social assistance and universal schemes),
employer’s liability provisions, or a combination
of these methods. Collectively financed schemes,
funded from insurance contributions, taxation or
both, are based on the principles of solidarity and
risk-pooling, and therefore ensure a fairer distribution of the costs and responsibility of reproduction.
Employer’s liability provisions, on the other hand,
oblige employers to bear the economic costs of
maternity directly, which often results in a double
burden (payment both of women’s wages during
maternity leave and costs of their replacement),
although employers may be able to obtain commercial insurance to cover these liabilities. While some
individual workers may obtain appropriate compensation under such provisions, employers may be
tempted to adopt practices that deny women the
income security to which they should be entitled
in order to avoid the related costs and the financial
hardship that they may entail for small businesses or
in times of instability. Discrimination against women
of childbearing age in hiring and in employment,
and non-payment of due compensation by the

employer, are more commonly evident in the absence of collective mechanisms to finance maternity protection. Pressure on women to resume work
to the detriment of their health or that of their child
may also be more prevalent where employers have
to bear the costs of maternity leave.
In order to protect the situation of women in the
labour market, the Maternity Protection Convention,
2000 (No. 183), states a preference for compulsory
social insurance or publicly funded programmes
as the vehicles for provision of cash benefits to
women during maternity leave, confining individual
employers’ liability for the direct costs of benefits
to a limited range of cases.1 Where women do not
meet qualifying conditions for entitlement to maternity cash benefits, Convention No. 183 requires the
provision of adequate benefits financed by social
assistance funds, on a means-tested basis.
Maternity cash benefits financed collectively have
proved the more effective means of securing an income to women during maternity leave. In recent
years, several countries have shifted from employer’s liability provisions to collectively financed maternity benefits, a trend that represents an advance
for the promotion of equal treatment for men and
women in the labour market.

According to Art. 6, para. 8, of Convention No. 183: ”An employer shall not be individually liable for the direct cost of
any such monetary benefit to a woman employed by him or her without that employer’s specific agreement except where:
(a) such is provided for in national law or practice in a member State prior to the date of adoption of this Convention by the
International Labour Conference; or (b) it is subsequently agreed at the national level by the government and the representative organizations of employers and workers.”

3.2.3  Legal coverage
Worldwide, the vast majority of women in employment
are still not protected against loss of income in the event
of maternity. Forty-five per cent of employed women
benefit from mandatory coverage by law and thus are
legally entitled to periodic cash benefits as income replacement during their maternity leave. Only 42 countries achieve close to universal coverage with more than
90 per cent of women in employment enjoying a legal
right to maternity cash benefits on a mandatory basis
(see figure 3.4). At the same time, in ten countries, most
of them in sub-Saharan Africa, less than 10 per cent
of women in employment are covered according to the
law. Yet unless these legal provisions are not adequately
implemented and enforced, women may find it difficult
to access the benefits to which they are entitled.

3.2.4  Effective coverage: Monitoring
SDG indicator 1.3.1 for mothers
with newborns
Concerning effective maternity benefit coverage, new
ILO estimates for SDG indicator 1.3.1 show that only
41.1 per cent of mothers with newborns received a contributory or non-contributory benefit, with large variations across regions. While more than 80 per cent of
women giving birth received a maternity benefit in
Europe and Central Asia, this was the case for only 16 per
cent of childbearing women in Africa (see figure 3.5).
The reasons for incomplete coverage largely relate to
the prevalence of informal employment and the lack of
appropriate mechanisms to cover women outside formal
employment. As an additional indicator for effective
coverage shows, only a minority of employed women
contribute to social insurance or are protected thorough
non-contributory cash benefits (see figure 3.6).
Universal maternity coverage is a trait of high-income
countries. Effective universal maternity coverage has also

been achieved in Mongolia, Ukraine and Uruguay,
while other developing countries, including Argentina,
Colombia and South Africa, have made significant progress. Among the 123 countries for which data are available, only 22 countries – mostly in Europe – provide
close to universal effective coverage for more than 90 per

cent of women in employment; 25 countries cover 67 to
89 per cent of women, 23 countries cover 33 to 66 per
cent, 18 countries 11 to 33 per cent, 32 countries less
than 10 per cent, and in three countries maternity leave
is unpaid (figure 3.6). Chapter 6 presents country and
regional data.

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

3.2.5  Adequacy of maternity benefits
in ensuring income security
during maternity leave
The adequacy of cash benefits provided during maternity leave to meet the needs of mothers and their babies
can be assessed in terms of duration and amount. In
order to allow women to recover fully after childbirth,
99 countries out of 192 provide at least 14 weeks’ paid
maternity leave, meeting the standards of Convention
No. 183; of these, 37 countries provide 18–26 weeks,
and 11 more than 26 weeks (see figure 3.7). In 49 countries, the length of paid maternity leave is 12–13 weeks,
which still meets the minimum standard set out in
Convention No. 102. In 30 countries, maternity leave
with cash benefits is less than 12 weeks.
The level of the maternity cash benefit, calculated
as a proportion of women’s previous earnings for a
minimum number of weeks of paid maternity leave,
varies widely from country to country (figure 3.8). In
73 out of the 192 countries, women are entitled to paid
maternity leave of at least two-thirds of their regular
salary for a minimum period of 14 weeks, meeting the
benchmark of Convention No. 183. In 26 countries,
women are entitled to 100 per cent of their regular
salary for at least 18 weeks, meeting the highest standard set out in Recommendation No. 191. An additional six countries provide benefit at a fixed level
(for instance, the minimum wage). This leaves a large

number of countries (52) in which women are entitled
to benefit at a level lower than 67 per cent of previous earnings for a minimum of 12–13 weeks, which
falls short of the benchmark of Convention No. 183,
but is still in compliance with the minimum requirements of Convention No. 102. In 32 countries, the
cash benefit corresponds to less than 45 per cent of the
previous salary and/or the period of paid maternity
leave is under 12 weeks.
Several countries have extended the duration of paid
maternity leave in law, following the adoption of Convention No. 183 in 2000. Although they have not yet
ratified it, China, Colombia and Malta now meet the
minimum benefit level requirements set by this Convention, and several countries, including Bangladesh,
Chile, India, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and
Viet Nam, have gone further. A number of other countries (including Finland and Ireland) have increased
the minimum rate of benefit levels and indexation
mechanisms.
3.2.6  Access to maternal health care
Effective access to free, or at least affordable, and appropriate antenatal and postnatal health care and services
for pregnant women and mothers with newborns is an
essential component of maternity protection. The reduction of maternal and child mortality is highlighted

in SDG targets 3.1 and 3.2, also linked to target 5.6.5
Access to maternal health care is closely associated with
access to health care in general, which is highlighted in
SDG target 3.8 and discussed in Chapter 5.

Many countries have achieved remarkable progress
in reducing maternal and child mortality, but others
are still facing major challenges in this regard (WHO,
2017). Despite significant advances, effective access to

A large share of maternal deaths is linked to unsafe abortions. Access to reproductive health and rights is a key component of postnatal health
care for women, in order to guarantee spaced pregnancies, overall reduced fertility and therefore poverty reduction and gender equality at work.

where health protection is available to the majority of
the population, but lower where a large proportion of
the population is not protected (ILO, 2014a). Where
effective access to health care is not universal, economic
deprivation too often translates into health deprivation
(see Chapter 5). Significant inequities persist in access
to maternal health care between urban and rural areas,
and between richer and poorer groups of the population
(see e.g. Nawal, Sekher and Goli, 2013). For example, in
Nepal or Senegal, more than 80 per cent of women in
the highest wealth quintile give birth attended by skilled
health personnel, yet less than one-third of women in
the lowest wealth quintile do so (see figure 3.11). The
lack of skilled health personnel with adequate working

antenatal care is still far from universal in many parts of
the world (see figure 3.9). According to the latest available data, fewer than two-thirds of childbearing women
receive the recommended four visits to a health facility
prior to giving birth.
Globally, while the proportion of births attended by
skilled health personnel has increased thanks to greater
investments in health systems and greater political attention to maternal and child health, more than half
of all births in Africa cannot rely on the necessary level
of medical attention, contributing to still unacceptable
levels of maternal and child mortality (see figure 3.10).
Health coverage is a key factor in facilitating access
to maternal health care. Access to antenatal care is high

conditions plays a key role in the persistence of these coverage gaps. Such persistent inequalities have detrimental
effects on both maternal and child health, with often
harmful long-term consequences for poverty reduction,
gender equality and women’s economic empowerment.
The availability of quality maternal care services
(using the percentage of births supervised by skilled
birth attendants as a proxy) is associated with lower
maternal mortality ratios (see figure 3.12). In addition,
the available evidence suggests that income security
also contributes to the well-being of pregnant women,
new mothers and their children. Countries that have a
higher level of coverage for maternity cash benefits also
tend to achieve better results with respect to maternal
mortality ratios (ILO, 2014a). These results call for a
comprehensive approach to maternity protection, combining maternal health care and income security, complemented by occupational safety and health measures,
as stipulated in ILO maternity protection standards.
3.2.7  Towards universal maternity protection:
Opportunities and challenges
Effective maternity protection is one of the key social
protection elements in improving the lives of mothers
and their children as well as health and nutrition outcomes, and contributing to gender equality. Guaranteeing maternity protection to all women not only realizes
women’s and children’s human rights, but is also an
investment in each country’s future human capital. Yet

too many women worldwide still do not enjoy adequate
levels of maternity protection, with regard to both
access to maternal care and ensuring income security.
Extending maternity protection coverage to women
who were previously unprotected contributes to enhancing income security at a critical period in people’s lives.
Such reforms can be achieved through a combination of
different measures, as described below.
Replacing full or partial employer liability mechanisms by collectively financed social insurance mechanisms is key to increasing the effectiveness of maternity
protection and removing disincentives for the employment of women (see box 3.3). Some countries, such as
Jordan, are moving away from full employer liability
(ILO, 2014a, 2016a). Others, such as South Africa,
have extended the coverage of existing social insurance
mechanisms to additional categories of workers.
The introduction or extension of non-contributory
maternity benefits, funded by taxes or in some cases
external grants, is an important means of ensuring
maternity protection for those women outside formal
employment or those in the formal economy who do
not qualify for contributory benefits due to the forms
and conditions of their employment relationship (ILO,
2014d; 2016a). Non-contributory benefits are usually
not directly associated with an interruption of employment in the form of maternity leave, but pursue a
broader objective of providing pregnant women and
new mothers with a predictable cash benefit during
the final stages of their pregnancy and after childbirth
(see box 3.4). They therefore represent an important

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.3 Extending maternity protection coverage through social insurance
in Jordan, Lao PDR, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Rwanda and South Africa
Several countries and territories have extended coverage of maternity benefits in recent years through social insurance:
• Jordan’s social insurance scheme has provided maternity coverage since 2011 for workers in the private
sector, financed through employer contributions of
0.75 per cent of assessable earnings. The scheme
gives insured women the right to paid maternity leave
at 100 per cent of previous earnings for a maximum
of ten weeks.
• In South Africa, maternity and unemployment protection was extended to domestic and seasonal workers
in 2003. After five years, 633,000 domestic workers
were registered, and 324,000 had received benefits.

• Rwanda’s maternity protection law (2016) extends
paid maternity leave to 12 weeks on full salary, half
of which is now provided by a new maternity insurance scheme managed by the Rwanda Social Security
Board and financed by a contribution of 0.6 per cent
of the salary, equally split between employee and employer (see box 6.5).
• In the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Social
Security Law adopted in 2016 will introduce a comprehensive social insurance scheme including maternity
coverage.
• In Lao People’s Democratic Republic, informal
workers have the possibility to be covered under the
2014 Social Security Law on a voluntary basis, yet
effective coverage has been limited so far.

Box 3.4  Extending maternity protection coverage through non-contributory social assistance programmes
in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Peru, Togo and the United Republic of Tanzania
A number of countries have introduced cash transfer
programmes for pregnant women and new mothers.
• In Bangladesh, the Maternity Allowance Programme
for Poor Lactating Mothers (MAP), introduced in
2008, provides poor women in rural areas aged 20
and over with one-time support during their first or
second pregnancy to the amount of BDT 350 per
month (approximately US$4.50) for a period of two
years. The MAP programme covered 220,000 women
in 2014 –15 at a cost of 0.01 per cent of GDP.
Furthermore, allowances for urban low-income lactating mothers covered some 100,000 women in
2014–15 at a cost of 0.0045 per cent of GDP.
• Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP)
provides pregnant women in food-insecure and poor
households, regardless of their employment status,
with cash benefits after six months of pregnancy and
during the first ten months after delivery, exempting
them from participating in public work. This could be
considered as a form of paid maternity leave. However,
in several field sites, women reported that they continued working throughout their pregnancy as they
feared losing their entitlement to the benefits if they
interrupted their work.
• In India, the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana
(IGMSY) Programme, launched in 2010 in 52 pilot
districts, aims at improving the health and nutritional
status of women and their children. Pregnant and
breastfeeding women aged 19 and over, regardless of their employment status, receive maternity
cash benefits for their first two pregnancies. A cash
transfer equal to US$67.20 is paid to registered
women in three instalments upon compliance with

specific conditions, including medical check-ups
for mother and child, exclusive breastfeeding, vac­
cinations and at tendance at health counselling
­s essions. The cash transfers are equivalent to approximately 40 days of lost work under minimum
wage ­conditions.
• In Peru, the conditional cash transfer programme
JUNTOS, introduced in 2005, provides cash transfers
to pregnant women, children and adolescents up to
the age of 19 years who are living in extreme poverty.
They receive PEN 200 every two months under certain conditions: pregnant women have to attend antenatal examinations, children have to attend medical
examinations and school. In 2014, JUNTOS reached
out to 753,638 households.
• The Cash Transfer Programme for Vulnerable Children
in Northern Togo provides unconditional cash benefits
on a monthly basis to vulnerable households to prevent
and manage child malnutrition. Eligible for benefits
are pregnant women (at least three months), children
during the first 24 months of their lives and severely
undernourished children until nearly the age of five
years. Beneficiaries are encouraged to attend nutritional training sessions and to ensure education and
health care of their children.
• In the United Republic of Tanzania, the Social Action
Fund (TASAF) provides cash transfers to pregnant
women equivalent to US$6, disbursed every two
months on condition that they attend at least four
antenatal medical exams, or health and nutrition sessions every two months, depending on availability of
services, and present their children for regular medical routine checks.

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Box 3.5  Paternity leave and parental leave: Promoting the involvement of fathers
While maternity protection is directly related to women’s biological role, particularly with regard to recovery from childbirth and exclusive breastfeeding,
much of the care work that a small infant needs can
be divided between both parents. Both mothers and
fathers have important roles in caregiving and interactions with the children. The greater involvement of
fathers in child care not only has positive effects on
children’s health and parent–child interactions, but
also contributes to gender equality in the home and
at work.
Many countries, therefore, have reformed their
leave policies to facilitate greater involvement of
­fathers in childcare through introducing or extending

paternity leave, as well as providing incentives to
increase men’s take-up of parental leave. While in
1994 only 40 countries reported statutory paternity leave provisions, by 2015 leave entitlements for
fathers were provided in at least 94 countries out
of 170 for which data were available. For example,
Myanmar and Uruguay extended paternity leave,
paid by social insurance. The Islamic Republic of
Iran introduced compulsory leave for fathers of
two weeks’ duration in 2013. Other countries that
have recently introduced or extended paid paternity
leave include the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Mexico, Nicaragua,
Paraguay and Portugal.

source of income security around childbirth in the
absence of contributory benefits. Many programmes
focus on improving health and nutrition outcomes
from conception to the first stage of a child’s life. These
programmes typically target pregnant women and children up to the age of two years (the “first 1,000 days”)
in food-insecure households, and often combine cash
benefits with antenatal and postnatal care visits, nutritional supplements and information sessions on breastfeeding and nutrition. Some programmes explicitly aim
at increasing the acceptance of family planning methods and reducing the incidence of child marriage. Benefits are usually provided only to women above a certain
minimum age, and only for a certain number of pregnancies. Many of these are targeted to low-income or
food-insecure families, and are funded from the government budget, in some cases with external support.
Moreover, many existing programmes are not (yet)
anchored in national legislation and therefore do not
ensure a stable legal and financial basis for the programme nor a clear definition of eligibility criteria and
benefit packages.
While such nutrition-related programmes contribute to some extent to income security, in many cases
the level and frequency of cash benefits is not sufficient
to ensure adequate protection against economic and
health-related hardships for women and their children
over the entire critical period. In order to ensure at least
a minimum level of income security, various needs have
to be taken into account, such as the need for food,
housing, health care, transport, clothing, childcare and
other unpaid care work, as well as women’s income loss
around childbirth. There is evidence that food security
and nutrition objectives can only be achieved if cash

transfers are high enough to cover not only food needs
but also essential non-food needs (Devereux, 2015). In
other words, if nutrition-oriented cash transfer programmes for poor and food-insecure women are meant
to also contribute to income security for themselves and
their children during and after pregnancy, cash transfer levels have to be high enough to also cover essential
non-food needs and to release women from the pressure
to engage in both paid and unpaid work too far into
pregnancy or to return too soon after childbirth.
Moreover, cash transfer schemes should be sensitive
towards gender patterns with regard to the division of
paid work and unpaid household work and care responsibilities (ILO, 2016a). By assigning to women the main
responsibility for complying with the requirements of
conditional cash transfer programmes, women are continuously perceived as the sole caregivers responsible for
their children’s health and education (Fultz and Francis, 2013; Molyneux, 2007). Conditional cash transfers
aimed at improving children’s health and nutritional
status beyond the immediate period after delivery (ideally the maternity leave period in accordance with Convention No. 183), should therefore recognize that both
mothers and fathers have responsibilities as breadwinners and caregivers (see box 3.5) and should include
implementation modalities as well as services such as
quality and affordable childcare, as well as awarenessraising that challenges the traditional division of paid
work and unpaid care work and encourages its overall recognition, reduction and redistribution between
women and men (ILO, 2016a). Finally, conditionalities
should not induce extra burdens and costs in accessing often very low benefits, which risk limiting women’s entitlements. Women may simply not be able to

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.6  Achieving universal coverage through a combination of contribution
and tax funding in Australia and Mongolia
In order to achieve universal coverage, some countries
combine funding from contributions and taxation:
• In Australia, the National Paid Parental Leave
scheme, introduced in 2011, established an entitlement to 18 weeks of government-funded parental leave pay at the rate of the national minimum
wage for eligible working parents (mothers and
fathers). The scheme is subject to a (relatively generous) means test. Together with the “baby bonus”
that is also paid to non-working parents and is
subject to a stricter means test, the parental leave
scheme reaches close to universal coverage.
• In Mongolia, formal employees are covered by social insurance on a mandatory basis and receive a
replacement rate of 100 per cent of their covered
wage for four months. Herders, the self-employed
and workers in the informal economy can join

the scheme on a voluntary basis, and receive
maternity cash benefits for four months at a replacement rate of 70 per cent of their selected
reference wage after 12 months of contributions.
In addition, maternity cash benefits under the
Social Welfare Scheme are provided to all pregnant women and mothers of infants regardless of
their contribution to the social insurance scheme,
status in employment or nationality. The benefit,
equivalent to approximately US$20 per month
(2015) is paid from the fifth month of pregnancy
for 12 months. Maternity care is provided through
the universal (tax-funded) health-care system. A
new law, passed in June 2017 (to enter into effect
on 1 January 2018), extended the benefits for up
to three years after the birth, for women who have
suspended their work for childcare reasons.

afford transport costs or time spent in waiting wards
if these are not offset by the transfer, and thus give up
their benefits (Dasgupta, Sandhya and Mukherjee,
2012). These considerations are essential for achieving
a more equitable sharing of care responsibilities, in line
with SDG target 5.4 on gender equality. ILO research
points to evidence that most gender-related interventions in the framework of cash transfer programmes
have focused on breaking the intergenerational cycle
of poverty, particularly for disadvantaged girl children,
but have been weaker in promoting women’s economic
empowerment through employment or sustainable
livelihoods. It also highlights the challenge of enhancing women’s economic empowerment with targeted
actions aimed at reducing women’s time poverty and
redistributing unpaid care responsibilities between
women and men and between families and the State.
The case of Mexico’s Progresa/Oportunidades/Prospera
Programme shows that employment-related services in
combination with child care and other social services,

either as part of the programme or articulated with
other initiatives such as childcare centres (estancias infantiles), hold potential to multiply the positive effects
of the programme and increase women’s labour force
participation (Orozco Corona and Gammage, 2017).
In many cases, universal coverage and adequate
benefit levels for maternity protection will be achieved
by combining contributory and non-contributory
mechanisms (see box 3.6). An effective coordination of
these mechanisms within the social protection system is
essential to guaranteeing at least a basic level of income
security for women workers in case of maternity, and
facilitating their access to maternal and child health
care. These elements are key to building a social protection floor for all as part of each country’s national social
security system and comprehensive continuum of care
policies, and contributing to the broader objectives of
promoting the health and well-being of mothers and
their children, achieving gender equality at work and
advancing decent work for both women and men.

3.3  Unemployment protection
KEY MESSAGES
nn
Unemployment protection schemes provide income support over a determined period of time to
unemployed workers and can be achieved through unemployment insurance or assistance and
employment guarantee programmes, complemented by minimum income guarantee programmes.
Such schemes are important for guaranteeing income security to unemployed and underemployed
workers and their families, thereby contributing to preventing poverty, providing safeguards against
informalization, and supporting structural change of the economy.
nn
Worldwide, only 38.6 per cent of the labour force is covered in law by unemployment protection
benefits, largely due to high levels of informal employment and the lack of unemployment protection
schemes.
nn
Effective coverage for SDG indicator 1.3.1 is even lower: only 21.8 per cent of unemployed workers
worldwide actually receive unemployment benefits, and regional differences are large, with effective
coverage ranging from 42.5 per cent of unemployed workers in Europe and Central Asia to just over
22 per cent in the Asia and Pacific region, 16.7 per cent in the Americas and only 5.6 per cent in Africa.

40

nn
While a number of high-income countries have increased unemployment protection coverage and
benefit levels, others have scaled down protection, often as a result of austerity policies. In recent
years, various middle- and low-income countries have made progress in strengthening their unemployment protection policies by introducing unemployment insurance schemes and expanding their
scope, combining them with employment promotion measures and other labour market policies as
part of an integrated package.
nn
In contexts of high informal employment, further efforts are required to introduce innovative measures
that combine unemployment cash benefits with employment guarantee schemes, (re)training and/
or support for entrepreneurship. Effective coordination with employment policies is necessary for
unemployment benefits to fully achieve their potential.

3.3.1  Guaranteeing income security,
supporting structural change in
the economy and achieving the SDGs
The primary objective of unemployment protection
schemes is to guarantee income security in case of job
loss or the lack of a job; this can be achieved through
unemployment insurance or assistance, employment
guarantee programmes or other public employment
programmes and/or minimum income guarantee programmes. In addition, unemployment protection measures are intended to facilitate return to employment
and access to more decent and productive employment
through employment promotion programmes, skills development and entrepreneurship support measures. This
double objective of unemployment protection schemes
is at the core of the ILO Promotion of Employment and
Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988
(No. 168) (see box 3.7). Most schemes provide or link
6

with employment services such as job-matching, support, counselling and advice, as well as facilities for enhancing, updating and developing skills (ILO, 2014a;
Peyron Bista and Carter, 2017).
By providing income replacement for the loss of
earnings and cushioning the loss of incomes, unemployment protection schemes play a fundamental role in preventing individuals from falling into poverty once they
become unemployed (Carter, Bédard and Peyron Bista,
2013), thereby helping to accelerate progress towards
achieving the SDGs by 2030. Unemployment protection
can effectively reduce household vulnerability by buffering the impact of the loss of employment. Because such
schemes provide unemployed workers with temporary
financial support, they can also play an important role
in preventing unemployed workers from slipping into
informality (Florez and Perales, 2016; ILO, 2014a).
Moreover, unemployment protection schemes that
link income support with active labour market policies6

Active labour market policies traditionally include different types of interventions: (i) matching jobseekers with current vacancies;
(ii) upgrading and adapting jobseekers’ skills; (iii) providing employment subsidies; and (iv) creating jobs either through public sector
employment or the provision of subsidies for private sector work (ILO, 2016g).

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.7  International standards on unemployment protection
Giving effect to the right to social security enshrined
in various international human rights instruments
requires that effective social protection be guaranteed in the event of unemployment. Unemployment
is recognized in the 1948 Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR) as one of the contingencies to be covered by national social security systems (Art. 25(1)). The rights to access and maintain
benefits, in cash or in kind, without discrimination,
and to secure protection from unemployment,
among other things, are considered as forming
part of the right to social security as laid down in
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights (ICESCR) of 1966 (Art. 9) (see also
CESCR, 2008, paras 2 and 16).
ILO Conventions and Recommendations take a
broad approach to unemployment protection by setting standards for the provision of cash benefits and
services during periods of unemployment involving
a suspension of earnings, thereby giving practical
guidance for the implementation of the right to social
security. Their objective is twofold: to ensure that
individuals enjoy income security despite the loss of
earnings suffered as a result of unemployment, and
to support beneficiaries in finding productive and
freely chosen employment.
The S o cial S e curit y (Minimum S t andards)
Convention, 1952 (No. 102), requires the provision
of cash benefits to unemployed persons capable
of and available for work but unable to obtain suitable employment. It sets qualitative and quantitative benchmarks that must be met, at a minimum:
(1) to ensure the coverage of a substantial part of
the population; (2) to ensure that the level of cash
benefits represents at least a certain percentage of
beneficiaries’ former earnings and is thus deemed
sufficient to serve as income replacement, or that it
is sufficient to allow beneficiaries and their families
to enjoy decent standards of living and health (see
Annex III); and (3) to ensure that cash benefits are
provided for a period of time that is long enough for
them to serve their purpose.
The Employment Promotion and Protection against
Unemployment Convention, 1988 (No. 168), increases the level and scope of protection that should
be provided to the unemployed. In addition to full
unemployment, it covers partial unemployment (i.e.

can also increase lifetime earning potential by improving human capital through the development of skills
and capabilities (ILO, 2016g). Unemployment protection schemes facilitate job matching, which is associated

temporary reduction in the number of working hours)
and temporary suspension of work, as well as parttime work for those who are seeking full-time work. It
also requires the provision of social benefits to certain
categories of persons who have never been, or have
ceased to be, recognized as unemployed or covered
by unemployment protection schemes (e.g. new
entrants to the labour market, those previously self‑­
employed, etc.). Convention No. 168 further expands
the scope of support that should be provided to the
unemployed by advocating the combination of cash
benefits with measures that promote job opportunities and employment assistance (e.g. employment
services, vocational training and guidance), prioritizing
support to disadvantaged persons. Its accompanying
Recommendation, No. 176, provides guidance on
how to assess the suitability of employment for those
seeking it, taking into account the age of unemployed
persons, their length of service in their former occupation, their acquired experience, the length of their
unemployment and the state of the labour market.
The Social Protection Floors Recommendation,
2012 (No. 202), guides countries in defining and
guaranteeing basic income security, at least at a
nationally defined minimum level, to all persons
of working age who are unable to earn sufficient
income, for reasons including unemployment, as
part of a national social protection floor. Such guarantee should be provided at least to all residents,
and may be furnished through a variety of means
including universal schemes, social insurance, social assistance, negative income tax, and/or public
employment and employment support programmes.
In a spirit similar to that of Convention No. 168, it
recommends that the design and implementation of
social protection floor guarantees combine preventative, promotional and active measures; that they
advance productive economic activity and formal
employment through labour market policies and policies that promote education, vocational training,
productive skills and employability; and that they are
well coordinated with other policies that enhance
formal employment, income generation, education,
literacy, vocational training, skills and employability,
that reduce precariousness, and that promote secure work, entrepreneurship and sustainable enterprises within a decent work framework.

with higher wages and longer job tenure, whose positive effects offset a marginal increase in the duration of
unemployment (ILO, 2016b; Tatsiramos, 2014).7 Employers are thus more likely to find candidates with the

In Brazil, for instance, employment services are found to increase unemployed workers’ probability of finding formal employment (Ramos,
2002). Similarly in Mexico, employment services are found to help unemployed men find jobs more quickly, with better pay and conditions
(Flores Lima, 2010). A recent study on Colombia shows that participation in the Public Employment Service increases the probability of

Box 3.8  Malaysia’s 1AZAM programme: An integrated approach to poverty reduction
In Malaysia, the Akhiri Zaman Miskin (1AZAM) programme aims at empowering low-income households
and reducing poverty as part of the Government’s
efforts to achieve high-income economy status by
2020.
The programme provides: cash transfers for those
most in need; job placement, training services, entrepreneurial support services; assistance in setting
up small agricultural businesses through the provision of seeds, equipment and machinery; support to
the setting up of small service-oriented businesses
through the provision of loans, training and counselling, particularly by women entrepreneurs; and

insurance services and housing facilities for lowincome households. By 2012, 63,147 poor households were registered in the 1AZAM programme,
and 3,100 women entrepreneurs were trained.
The programme follows an integrated approach of
economic and social empowerment of low-income
households, working closely with ministries in
charge of implementing rural development, urban
public transport and education policies, as well as
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), communities and other stakeholders. Further efforts are
needed, however, to improve the management and
targeting of the programme.

right skills and capabilities, which contributes to higher
productivity (Acemoglu and Shimer, 2000). Furthermore, unemployment protection schemes allow employers to flexibly adjust to technological changes by
making it easier for workers to accept employment termination (Peyron Bista and Carter, 2017). Unemployment protection is therefore beneficial for employers
and the economy as a whole, and contributes to facilitating labour participation, promoting more productive and decent work and preventing and reducing
poverty, both in the short and long run, as advanced by
SDG targets 1.3 and 8.5.
By supporting workers’ labour market mobility and
reskilling, unemployment benefit schemes also support
the structural transformation of the economy towards
higher levels of productivity (Behrendt, 2013; Berg and
Salerno, 2008; ILO, 2011b), including with regard to
a just transition towards more environmentally sustainable economies (ILO, 2016b). Unemployment
protection can facilitate the development and upgrading of people’s productive capacities, and is therefore
an effective tool in avoiding the deterioration of skills
and safeguarding the nation’s human capital, thereby
enhancing macroeconomic performance. In addition,
during major economic crises, such as the 2008–09
global crisis, income support can smooth not only individual incomes but also aggregate consumption, thereby
contributing to the post-crisis recovery of the economy
(ILO, 2014a).
8

Although unemployment protection is essential
in providing income and employment support, a large
number of countries still lack effective unemployment protection schemes. Many existing unemployment benefit programmes are contributory and better
fitted to cover workers in formal employment. In
countries with high levels of informality and vulnerability, particularly for the long-term unemployed, the
underemployed,8 the working poor and those outside
formal wage employment, unemployment insurance
schemes may not result in broad coverage and adequate protection. In such settings, social assistance
and active labour market programmes funded by the
State’s budget can play an important role (Peyron Bista
and Carter, 2017). Such policies include employment
guarantee schemes and other public employment programmes, as well as programmes that combine cash
transfers with support for skills development and the
creation of employment and entrepreneurship opportunities (see boxes 3.8 and 3.9) (ILO, 2014a).
Measures may envisage the extension of the coverage of contributory social insurance schemes to a larger
group of workers, including those in non-standard
forms of employment (ILO, 2016b, forthcoming b).
Such measures include adjusting thresholds to qualify
for benefits; the extension of contributory periods to
allow for breaks in labour market activity; allowing
flexibility in the payment of contributions; introducing
subsidies on the contributions; and the simplification

Underemployment as defined by the ILO exists when employed persons have not attained their full employment level in the sense of the
Employment Policy Convention, 1964 (No. 122). Underemployment refers to situations that do not fulfil the following objectives: (i) work is
as productive as possible; and (ii) workers have the freedom to choose their employment and all workers have the opportunity to acquire the
necessary skills to obtain the employment that most suits them, and to use in this employment such skills and other qualifications as they possess.

Box 3.9  Promoting women’s empowerment through
the Benazir Income Support Programme in Pakistan
The Government of Pakistan launched the Benazir
Income Support Programme in 2008 to cushion the
adverse effects of a food crisis and inflation. The
programme targets impoverished households, especially in remote areas. Its objectives are to empower
these households, improve their living standards
and invest in long-term human capital formation,
especially among women, through education, vocational training and self-employment.
A monthly cash transfer is provided along with an
integrated package of services:
• provision of interest-free loans to women for
starting their own businesses (Waseela-e-Haq).
• one year of free vocational training to female beneficiaries or their nominees, aiming at boosting their
economic independence through capacity building
and professional development (Waseela-e-Rozgar).
• health and life insurance that provides cash support in case of death of the breadwinner and to

cover hospitalization expenses, pregnancy care,
day-care treatment and diagnostic tests, aiming
at providing access to health care and reducing
the financial burden of marginalized groups
­(Waseela-e-Sehat).
• child allowance for children aged five to 12
­(Waseela-e-Taleem).
The Benazir Income Support Programme aims to
contribute to the social and economic empowerment
of women by making them the primary focus of the
monthly cash transfers, and other benefits such as
insurance, vocational training and microfinance.
More than 15 million women have obtained a national identification card through the programme,
including around 500,000 women in economically
difficult regions. To encourage the financial inclusion
of beneficiaries, the programme has introduced the
Benazir debit card and mobile phone banking.

of administrative procedures. In countries with a large
portion of the workforce outside formal employment,
complementing social insurance unemployment benefits with non-contributory schemes and active labour
market policies financed from general taxation is crucial
for filling the gaps and ensuring at least a basic level of
income security in case of unemployment (ILO, 2016b).
Non-contributory schemes may prevent the most vulnerable, including those who have exhausted their unemployment insurance, from falling into poverty, and
thereby have the potential to progressively reduce inequalities and encourage the fair distribution of economic wealth as per SDG target 10.4. Furthermore,
enhanced coordination of unemployment protection
schemes with other social security policies and employment services, as well as improved delivery mechanisms,
are highlighted as crucial tools to reach out to the poor
and vulnerable (Peyron Bista and Carter, 2017).
The effectiveness of unemployment protection
extends beyond protecting incomes and promoting
employment. Well-designed unemployment protection schemes and policies also have the scope to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment.
Indeed, SDG target 5.4 highlights the role that
social protection can play in recognizing and valuing
unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies. In countries such as Thailand and

Viet Nam, for instance, contributory unemployment
insurance schemes cover proportionally more female
than male workers, many being employed in the
manufacturing industry. Unemployment insurance
schemes in developing countries therefore have the
potential to promote – for example – gender equality. Besides, well-designed public employment programmes have proven to have a significant impact
on women (ILO, 2014d). India’s Mahatma Gandhi
National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme has
not only increased female labour participation, but in
some cases also women’s autonomy in intra-household
situations by providing higher wages than other rural
employment opportunities (Ehmke, 2015). Other programmes may include investments in the expansion
of community social care services, which hold significant potential to create employment for women. If
designed well, such programmes can also offer services, such as day care for children and crèche services.
However, programmes need to be designed in a way
that does not perpetuate gender inequalities. For example, evidence shows that in Peru, the public works
programme Construyendo Perú has increased employment possibilities for women, but often at the cost of
lower job quality (Escudero and Mourelo, 2016). In
developing unemployment protection schemes, it is
essential to address women’s specific social protection
needs as well as their specific life contingencies, such

as maternity.9 In this context, the extension of coverage to women through a combination of contributory
and non-contributory programmes, including public
employment programmes, can ensure their adequate
protection, whilst the provision of high-quality public
services and infrastructure is essential for increasing
women’s participation in the labour market (ILO,
2016a). However, public employment programmes
need to be designed in such a way as to avoid unintended negative effects on women, such as further
exacerbating women’s time poverty and the unequal
sharing of care responsibilities (Holmes, Sadana and
Rath, 2010).

3.3.2 Types of unemployment
protection schemes
Unemployment protection benefits are provided
through different types of schemes, or combinations
thereof (see figure 3.13 and box 3.10).
At present, fewer than half (98) of the 203 countries for which data are available have an unemployment protection scheme anchored in national law
(figure 3.13). In 92 of them, unemployment protection
benefits are provided through periodic cash benefits to
unemployed persons meeting the prescribed qualifying
conditions. Public social insurance is by far the most
common mechanism used to provide such regular

9
Given the formal and contributory nature of the majority of social protection programmes, women often face various difficulties in
accessing adequate unemployment protection, for several reasons. First, much of the work undertaken by women is informal and selfemployed work, providing them with limited or no access to unemployment insurance, depending on the national context. Second, where
they are in formal employment, their benefit levels tend to be lower due to gaps in contribution periods, often related to maternity and care
responsibilities for children or older persons. Third, wider public policies are often designed in such a way as to impose a double burden on
women, perpetuating gender stereotyping (ILO, 2017d).

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.10  Main types of unemployment protection schemes
Contributory unemployment benefit schemes. These
most commonly take the form of social insurance (unemployment insurance), based on collective financing
and pooling of the unemployment risk. Benefits are a
partial replacement of past earnings, provided in the
form of periodic payments and for a determined duration. The scheme is financed by contributions paid
by employers, or shared between employers and employees, or in some cases shared with the government.
They usually cover workers in formal employment, on
whose behalf regular contributions can be collected.1
In most schemes, the conditions for receiving unemployment benefits are linked to involuntary job loss;
however, in a few countries (and interestingly some
developing countries where labour inspection systems
have less capacity), unemployed workers are entitled to
benefits even when leaving a job by their own decision,
without just cause.² The nature and level of benefit,
duration of entitlement and obligations with regard to
jobseeking differ markedly.
Non-contributory unemployment benefit schemes.
Often referred to as unemployment assistance, these
schemes are usually funded at least partially through
general taxation and tend to provide a lower level of
benefits than insurance schemes to unemployed
workers who either do not qualify for contributory
benefits (e.g. because of a short contribution period)
or have exhausted their entitlement to unemployment
insurance benefits.
Employment guarantee schemes are in some ways
similar to unemployment assistance. These schemes
provide a legal entitlement to employment in public
works to poor workers in rural settings, and are among
the policy options that can be used to enhance income
security and employability for the working poor. The
largest and most closely studied scheme of this type
is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment
Guarantee Scheme in India. Ethiopia, too, has implemented a large-scale programme, the Productive Safety
Nets Programme which, although not providing a legally guaranteed income, combines public works with
food and cash benefits. South Africa’s Expanded Public
Works Programme aims at providing income security
by offering temporary work in four sectors (public infrastructure, environment, non-state and social sectors)
for the unemployed, thereby also addressing structural
problems where markets do not create sufficient jobs.
These three models of unemployment benefits are
aligned with the principles embedded in ILO standards
related to social security and unemployment protection,
which stipulate that risk should be shared on a collective
basis and contribution payments organized accordingly. Under such schemes, unemployment insurance

schemes have strong merits in terms of solidarity-based
risk-sharing and potential to act across national economies as automatic stabilizers. These benefits are also
in nearly all cases combined with measures to facilitate
a rapid return to employment and/or upgrading of skills,
thereby embodying the combination of income replacement and employment promotion that lies at the core
of Convention No. 168 and Recommendations Nos 176
and 202 (see box 3.7).
Some countries use other types of provision which
are not fully in line with the principles embedded in ILO
standards. Unemployment individual savings accounts
(UISA, sometimes misleadingly called Unemployment
insurance savings accounts) are considered by some as
alternative instruments to contributory unemployment
insurance schemes. They require individuals, mostly
workers in formal employment, to accumulate savings
in individual accounts which provide an income stream
in case of unemployment. However, such savings
schemes lack the key design element of risk-pooling;
the savings need to be set at a sufficiently high level
to build enough to compensate for lost earnings. They
thus provide only limited protection for those who have
difficulty in building up sufficiently high savings, if any,
due to their work patterns – for example, temporary and
seasonal workers, workers in declining economic sectors, young workers, among others. As unemployment
is far more likely to be found among low-income individuals, UISA benefit and coverage levels are likely to be
low (OECD, 2010; Peyron Bista and Carter, 2017).
In many countries, severance pay is the only form of
income compensation available to workers voluntarily
or involuntarily dismissed from certain forms of formal
employment. This type of compensation is provided
by the employer through lump-sum payments that are
proportionate to the workers’ prior job tenure, thus representing a form of deferred pay or enforced savings by
workers rather than a form of social risk-sharing. It offers little help to the unemployed in terms of facilitating
return to work, or to employers who may need to make
structural changes to their businesses, in addition to
creating a high financial burden on employers in times
of economic difficulty.3 While severance payments may
lead to higher job stability because employers tend to
reduce lay-offs during recessions so as to avoid such
payments, they can also discourage new recruitment
in times of economic expansion, which in turn leads to
longer unemployment periods and difficulties for young
people seeking a first job (Carter, 2016; Nagler, 2013).
For this reason, unemployment benefits based on the
principles of social insurance are considered more supportive of structural transformation in the economy than
severance pay.

  While in most countries unemployment insurance is mandatory, voluntary unemployment protection schemes exist in several
Scandinavian countries, where unemployment protection has traditionally been provided by trade unions and is supplemented by
non‑contributory schemes. 2  Involuntary unemployment excludes cases where an employee leaves a job of her or his own volition,
without just cause (e.g. harassment, resignation under threat), or where the employee has deliberately contributed to her or his own
dismissal (ILO, 2010a). 3  As a result, the provision of severance pay by the employer can be delayed or even not enforced in times
of negative cash flow. Its actual payment often depends not only on the employer’s financial situation, but also on the employee’s capacity to enforce payment, which is often problematic due to lengthy and costly judicial processes (Kuddo, Robalino and Weber, 2015).

income replacement. In some countries, contributory
mechanisms are complemented by social assistance.
Elsewhere, for example in Tunisia and Hong Kong
(China), non-contributory unemployment benefit
schemes have been recently introduced. Among the
105 countries which have no unemployment benefit
scheme anchored in national legislation, 50 countries
provide severance payments for workers covered by the
labour code, which provides a limited level of protection to some workers.
While most contributory or non-contributory unemployment benefit schemes are found in high-income
countries, a growing number of middle-income countries, such as Cabo Verde, Jordan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Morocco, have recently introduced
such schemes (figure 3.14).
3.3.3  Legal coverage
Around 38.6 per cent of the global labour force
is covered for unemployment protection through
10

mandatory contributory, non-contributory or employment guarantee schemes under national legislation (see
­figures 3.15 and 3.16). An additional 0.9 per cent of the
global labour force is potentially covered by contributory voluntary schemes.10 Legal coverage ranges from
4.2 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa, around 15.9 per
cent in South-Eastern Asia, 24.8 per cent in Eastern
Asia, 33.8 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean, 38.4 per cent in Northern Africa and 39.7 per
cent in Southern Asia11 to 60.4 per cent in the Arab
States, 77.6 per cent in Central and Western Asia and
over 80 per cent in Europe, Oceania, and Northern
America.
In some regions, women are less likely to be legally
covered, due to their greater representation in part‑time,
temporary or informal employment (Bonnet, 2015;
ILO, 2017d). For example, in Eastern Asia only 21 per
cent of the female labour force is covered by law, compared to 24.8 per cent of the overall labour force, and in
Northern Africa only 29.3 per cent of the female labour
force is covered by law, compared to 38.4 per cent of the
overall labour force.

Voluntary coverage provided for in the legislation often does not result in actual coverage for various reasons.
This includes an estimate of legal coverage for India’s employment guarantee scheme, amounting to 24.4 per cent, which is based on an
estimate of the proportion of working or unemployed adults in the total rural labour force.

It should be noted that indicators for legal and effective coverage are not strictly comparable, as they refer to two different dimensions
of coverage and different reference populations (denominators). The legal coverage indicator refers to people eligible under legislation for
unemployment benefits as a proportion of the total labour force. The effective coverage indicator refers to the proportion of those receiving
unemployment benefits as a proportion of those currently unemployed.

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Figure 3.19 SDG indicator 1.3.1 on effective coverage
for unemployed persons: Percentage of unemployed
persons receiving cash benefits (contributory
or non‑contributory), latest available year

remaining 78.2 per cent are left without income support. However, this varies widely across regions and
countries (see figures 3.17 and 3.18). While 42.5 per
cent of the unemployed receive unemployment benefits
(including non-contributory benefits) in Europe and
Central Asia, this is the case for 22.5 per cent of the
unemployed in Asia and the Pacific, 16.7 per cent in
the Americas and only 5.6 per cent in Africa. The lack
of an unemployment protection scheme, particularly in
countries with high levels of informal employment, is
undoubtedly the major reason for the low coverage at
the global level; other factors include long contribution
periods13 and a short maximum duration of payment.
In many countries that have unemployment benefit
schemes in place, the number of unemployed workers actually receiving periodic cash benefits is still relatively low
(see figures 3.17–3.19).14 In only 11 out of the 96 countries with some type of scheme are more than two-thirds
of the unemployed covered, whilst in 48 countries less
than one-third actually receive unemployment benefits.
Possible reasons for this low coverage ratio include the
exclusion of certain groups of workers from legal coverage, such as domestic or part-time workers, a high proportion of long-term unemployed who have exhausted
their benefit entitlements, or a high share of unemployed
workers who do not meet the entitlement requirements.
In some instances, unemployment benefits may not
be claimed if for example benefit levels are too low or
stigma is attached to the receipt of benefits. Another
reason may be high informality, especially where it takes
the form of undeclared work and workers informally
receive wages in cash, commonly known as “envelope
wages”. In case of unemployment, such workers may be
legally but not effectively covered.
High coverage is associated with higher income security for beneficiaries, provided that benefit levels are
adequate. As can been seen in figure 3.20 for European
countries, unemployment benefits are important in reducing poverty for the unemployed.

13

Conventions Nos 102 and 168 both require that the qualifying
period be no longer than necessary to preclude abuse. Countries
usually require either six or 12 months of contributions to
qualify. Mongolia has the highest requirement, at 24 months of
contributions, the last nine of which must be continuous, thereby
excluding those with seasonal or temporary work contracts
(Carter, Bédard and Peyron Bista, 2013).
14
Some of those not covered by unemployment benefit
schemes may, however, receive other benefits such as general
social assistance benefits.

3.3.5 Expanding support for those
without jobs: Global trends
In recent years many high-income countries have carried out a series of measures to extend unemployment
benefits and to expand the scope of protection under
unemployment benefit schemes by combining unemployment cash benefits with measures such as skills
development, training and other active labour market

policies. On the other hand, many countries have reduced the level of protection to unemployed workers,
often as a result of fiscal consolidation (see box 3.11).
Despite the considerable challenges in implementing unemployment protection schemes, several middleand low-income countries have recently introduced
schemes to protect unemployed and underemployed
workers against poverty and income insecurity and to
prevent them from slipping into informal employment.

Box 3.11 Recent trends in unemployment protection: Selected examples
Many countries are continuing to reform their unemployment protection schemes. There are divergent trends: while some countries expand unemployment protection, others reform their systems,
often as a result of fiscal consolidation. As reported
in the media, the following measures have been
considered (examples):
• Ireland plans to offer 500 additional places for the
Rural Social Scheme, a public employment programme which provides supplementary income for

low-income farmers and fishers who are unable to
earn an adequate living (2017).
• Under the United Kingdom’s Welfare Reform and
Work Act 2016, benefits for people of working age
will be frozen for four years, starting in April 2016.
• Brazil plans to introduce a compensatory fund
for dismissal without due cause, based on employer contributions of 3.2 per cent of the monthly
pay of the domestic worker. In addition, an unemployment insurance for rural workers who lose
their jobs without a valid reason will be introduced.

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Consolidating achievements
in high-income countries
Increasing unemployment protection coverage,
benefit levels and duration. Several high-income countries have extended access to existing or new unemployment benefits. Some, such as Austria,15 extended coverage
by relaxing the eligibility conditions for unemployment
schemes with regard to qualifying periods; others, such
as Canada, reduced the waiting periods for unemployment benefits. Most countries extended coverage to
workers previously excluded, such as non-regular workers
in Germany and Japan, the self-employed in Greece16
and Italy, and young people in France.17 Other countries (e.g. Denmark18 and Italy19) extended coverage to
include those who would otherwise be deemed to have
exhausted their rights, or increased the generosity of
benefits by allowing beneficiaries to retain their entitlement upon entering into short-term or temporary
employment (e.g. Denmark, Portugal and Spain), or introduced financial incentives so as to support employability and return to work (e.g. France20), or increased
the level of benefits or the maximum amount of allowance (e.g. France, Estonia21 and Sweden). In the OECD
countries, median net replacement rates increased
between 2001 and 2014 for those who were unemployed

for less than 12 months, but decreased for the longterm unemployed (OECD, 2017a). In Finland, a pilot
experiment tests the possibility of replacing basic unemployment benefits by a basic income (see box 3.12).
Several countries (e.g. Greece and Hungary) initiated public employment programmes. By guaranteeing
a temporary predictable income stream for unemployed
and underemployed workers, these programmes can
play a complementary role to life-cycle-based social protection instruments (OECD, 2009b).
In response to the unemployment challenges faced
by young people, many countries (e.g. Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom) continue to
strengthen their efforts to provide support in finding
employment, training and retraining, and measures
to increase employability. These programmes, aimed
at tackling youth unemployment, include measures to
increase the quality of apprenticeship systems, vocational training and other school-to-work transition programmes, to provide counselling ranging from career
guidance to mentoring, and to support the acquisition of work experience (e.g. the EU Youth Guarantee Programme). Some countries, such as the Czech
Republic, Italy, Slovenia and Spain, have relaxed the
qualifying conditions of unemployment benefits for
young people or explicitly opened schemes to them.

Box 3.12 Experimenting with a basic income for unemployed jobseekers
In Finland, a t wo -year basic income pilot assesses the possibility of replacing some basic
social security benefits, including the basic unemployment benefit and the sickness benefit, as
well as some parental benefits and rehabilitation
benefits, by a monthly basic income of EUR 560,
paid to 2,0 0 0 randomly selected recipients of

unemployment benefits between 25 and 58 years
of age, without a means test.
The results of the experiment will provide insights
into the effectiveness of basic income with respect
to promoting labour market participation and simplifying the administration as compared to the existing
system.

In Austria, the periods of payment of child allowances were recognized for entitlement to unemployment benefits.
Greece is one of the first countries to extend coverage to self-employed workers. The unemployment allowance of EUR 360 per month
will be provided for three to nine months. Those who have paid social contributions for three years, had an annual personal income of up to
EUR 20,000 in each of the two years prior to unemployment or annual family income of up to EUR 30,000 are entitled to the allowance
(ISSA and SSA, 2017b). In other countries, the main obstacles to the implementation of such schemes are concerns over a proper definition
of activity, over‑burdensome contributions and moral hazard.
17
Unemployment protection is extended to young people between 18 and 25 years of age who were previously excluded from the Active
Solidarity Income (RSA).
18
The unemployment benefit reform in Denmark in 2015 envisaged increasing the duration of the unemployment benefit from two to a
maximum of three years, largely financed by a reduction of benefits targeted at graduates (OECD, 2016).
19
Italy increased coverage by providing means-tested income support for workers who have exhausted their entitlement to regular
unemployment benefits, or who have children or are close to retirement age.
20
To support return to employment, France introduced an activity allowance (prime d’activité). This enables unemployed persons to keep
their allowances when they find a new job within the duration of their benefit allowances. The target groups are seniors and low-skilled
workers on short-term or interim contracts.
21
The ceiling and minimum level of unemployment insurance benefits and the rate of unemployment assistance benefits were raised slightly.
16

51

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Public employment programmes and temporary wage
subsidies (e.g. in France, Estonia and Latvia) also serve
as important instruments in the move from passive to
active labour market policies targeted at young people.

52

Pressure to scale down unemployment protection.
While many countries have increased unemployment
protection coverage and levels in recent years, there have
also been measures towards scaling down unemployment protection, often as a result of austerity policies
(see box 3.13). These include the tightening of entitlement conditions for unemployment benefits (Belgium,22
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,23 Greece and Hungary), increases in the contribution period to become
eligible for unemployment benefits (France), the introduction of a higher earnings threshold for eligibility (Finland), reductions in the maximum period for
which benefits could be paid (Finland24 and the Netherlands25), and reductions in the level of benefits (Finland, Greece, Latvia and Spain).
In many countries there is a trend towards strengthening the link between income support and active labour
market policies by tightening conditions and obligations of jobseekers. Under many schemes, notably in the
Member States of the European Union, the requirements
for unemployment benefit recipients with respect to their
availability for work have increased (European Commission, 2015a). Some countries, such as Belgium, Finland and Latvia, have tightened job search requirements
and the monitoring of unemployment benefit recipients.
Other measures include tighter conditions related to the
provision of benefits with respect to the obligatory acceptance of a job (e.g. in the Netherlands), occupational
mobility (e.g. in Belgium and Latvia) and geographical
mobility (e.g. in Canada, Finland, Latvia and New Zealand), as well as participation in public works or training
(e.g. in Italy, Slovakia and the United Kingdom). Several
countries have introduced or increased sanctions for refusing job offers or participation in active labour market
interventions (e.g. United Kingdom) (European Commission, 2016; Langenbucher, 2015).
While these measures may facilitate quicker
(re)‌integration into the labour market, some workers,

especially those with short employment spells and less
stable employment histories, may face challenges in
qualifying for and actually receiving unemployment
benefits, since entitlements often depend on previous
work records and/or contributions paid. The tightening of entitlement conditions may thus lead to lower
coverage and a lower stabilization impact (Esser et al.,
2013; Langenbucher, 2015). Similarly, although tighter
job search requirements can be effective in moving
individuals off unemployment benefits, they do not
support them in moving into stable or better jobs
(Petrongolo, 2009).

Establishing unemployment protection schemes
and extending coverage in developing countries
In recent years many developing countries have introduced significantly expanded unemployment benefit
schemes or implemented measures to tackle underemployment. These policies are intended not only to
provide income security to unemployed or underemployed workers, but also to protect them from
slipping into the informal economy. The different
schemes include various types of unemployment insurance and assistance as well as employment guarantee schemes, and provide different levels of protection.
Under most schemes, the provision of cash benefits is
linked to employment support and training measures
aimed at (re)integrating unemployed workers into the
labour market.
A number of countries, including Cabo Verde,
Jordan, Kuwait, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mauritius, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, South Africa
and Viet Nam, have introduced unemployment protection schemes (see boxes 3.13 and 3.14). Indonesia, Malaysia, Oman, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq,
Philippines and United Arab Emirates, among others,
are in the process of assessing the feasibility of establishing their first unemployment insurance schemes
(Kulke and Alaraimi, 2017; Peyron Bista and Carter,
2017). In addition, some countries have expanded coverage of their unemployment insurance schemes to

22
Belgium has tightened the eligibility requirements for special unemployment benefit schemes for workers close to retirement, as well as
for the unemployment allowance for young unemployed persons, by adjusting the age requirements.
23
Members of a management board were prevented from access to benefits.
24
The Finnish Government has decided to reduce the maximum duration of unemployment benefits from 500 to 400 days for those who
have worked longer than three years before becoming unemployed, and to 300 days for those who have worked less than three years before
becoming unemployed.
25
In the Netherlands, the maximum duration of unemployment benefits has been reduced from 38 to 24 months. The duration of
unemployment benefits as a function of the contributory period is also cut down.

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.13 Expanding unemployment protection in Cabo Verde, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mauritius, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Viet Nam
In recent years, nine countries have introduced unemployment protection schemes:
• C abo Verde introduced a contributor y unemployment benefit scheme in 2016.
• In 2011 Jordan introduced unemployment benefits
for jobseekers who have lost their jobs for a
maximum period of three months on condition that
they provide evidence of job search.
• Kuwait introduced an unemployment insurance
scheme in 2013, covering unemployed workers
between 18 and 60 years of age and those in­
eligible for an old-age pension.
• Lao People’s Democratic Republic introduced an
unemployment insurance scheme in 2015.

• Mauritius complemented its social assistance
scheme with a social insurance scheme in 2009.
• Morocco in 2014 introduced an unemployment
insurance scheme for private-sector salaried
workers and apprentices in industry, commerce,
agriculture as well as certain categories of workers
in the fishing sector.
• Saudi Arabia implemented a new unemployment
insurance scheme in 2014.
• South Africa’s Unemployment Insurance Amendment Act, approved in 2017, foresees the extension
of coverage to additional categories of workers,
such as those in training and civil servants.
• Viet Nam initiated an employment insurance scheme
in 2009 and reformed it in 2013 (see box 3.14).

Box 3.14  Unemployment protection in Viet Nam
Viet Nam introduced an employment insurance
scheme in its Social Insurance L aw of 20 0 6.
Contribution collection started in 2009, and the first
benefits were disbursed in 2010.
In 2013, unemployment insurance provisions
were transferred to the Law on Employment Promotion as part of a larger reform aiming to increase
coverage, improve the efficiency of the scheme,
and streng then links bet ween unemployment
benefits and active labour market policies, in particular return-to-work programmes and employment-retention support. In addition to job counselling services and vocational training for up to six
months, the new law includes reference to training
and retraining programmes made available through
employers to upgrade workers’ qualifications and

skills that will maintain their employment. The law
also reinforces the role of the employment service
centres and their capacity to provide job counselling
and placement services. In this context, the Government has also intensified its efforts to integrate
public employment policies into the country’s national targeted programme for sustainable poverty
reduction. By 2015, 10.2 million workers – about
20 per cent of the total labour force – were insured
under the unemployment insurance scheme, Of the
527,576 persons who submitted a claim for the unemployment insurance allowance, 526,279 were
entitled to the monthly benefit; of these, 57 per
cent were women, 24,378 received vocational
training and 473,791 persons received employment
counselling services.

encompass workers at the margins of the formal economy or workers who were previously excluded. Jordan,
for example, has introduced measures to extend protection to self‑employed workers, while the voluntary
insurance scheme in Oman, which is subsidized for
low‑income earners, now covers self-employed workers
too (Kulke and Alaraimi, 2017). Bahrain is one of the
few countries that have included young workers with
as yet an insufficient contributory period in the scope
of unemployment protection benefits.
In some countries, particularly in Latin America
and the Caribbean, unemployment savings schemes are
considered as alternative instruments to contributory

unemployment insurance schemes. Such schemes have
been promoted in contexts with high levels of informal
employment and with weak administrative capacities
to check eligibility conditions, in order to monitor participation in job search and training programmes and
limit moral hazard (Robalino, Vodo­pivec and Bodor,
2009). However, such schemes are unlikely to provide adequate protection, as it is especially those persons with a high risk of becoming unemployed who
are unable to accumulate savings due to their work
patterns; other workers exhaust their accounts too
quickly and the scheme does not allow for risk pooling (Kuddo, Robalino and Weber, 2015; OECD, 2010;

53

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

54

Peyron Bista and Carter, 2017). The Chilean scheme
partially addresses the inability of many workers to accumulate sufficiently high savings, through a tax‑subsidized solidarity component which effectively makes it
a mixed scheme (Paes de Barros, Corseuil and Foguel,
2001; Holzmann and Vodopivec, 2012; ILO, 2014a).
However, where such schemes allow borrowing from
pension accounts, the result may be seriously reduced
income security in old age. Another shortcoming of
such schemes is the potential incentive for workers
to leave their jobs in order to withdraw part of their
savings, especially in instances with restricted access
to credit, which can result in higher turnover that
may add a cost for employers (Kuddo, Robalino and
Weber, 2015).
In countries without an unemployment insurance
scheme or other statutory income support programmes,
severance payments are used as a form of income support to provide workers with lump‑sum payments once
they become unemployed (Carter, Bédard and Peyron
Bista, 2013; Kuddo, Robalino and Weber, 2015). These
countries include El Salvador, Grenada and Guatemala,
among others. However, as mentioned above, severance
payments cannot be regarded as effective instruments to
provide adequate protection for unemployed workers.
Several countries, for example Malaysia, are therefore
considering a reform of their severance pay regulations,
taking into account the introduction of unemployment
insurance schemes with integrated employment services
(Kuddo, Robalino and Weber, 2015; Peyron Bista and
Carter, 2017).
Some countries have also expanded social assistance
programmes that provide a basic level of income security to vulnerable groups of the population. For example, Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam have focused on the
large informal sector involved in agriculture under their
cash transfer programmes (Carter, 2016). However,
while these may be important instruments to fill existing gaps, because of limited public budgets they usually
provide low benefit levels and, if not complemented by
contributory social protection schemes, are less likely to
reduce income inequalities (Berg, 2015a; Carter, 2016).
Furthermore, such programmes, particularly those with
behavioural conditions and complex targeting procedures, can have the unintended effect of excluding those
who are most vulnerable (Berg, 2015b; Kidd, Gelders
and Bailey-Athias, 2017).
In recent years a number of countries have initiated
employment guarantee schemes and public works programmes. Their primary aim is to provide temporary

employment and a certain level of income security to
those unemployed workers who are excluded from unemployment insurance, notably the self-employed and
rural workers during lean seasons when many are unemployed or underemployed. One of the most popular
programmes, India’s MGNREGS, introduced in 2005,
provides a legally guaranteed right to a maximum of
100 days of employment a year to rural households.
Many other countries, for example Cambodia, Indonesia, Malawi and the United Republic of Tanzania,
have been using public employment programmes to
provide poor people with some level of income security for at least a limited period of time, although
this is usually not based on a legal entitlement. Moreover, many measures under these programmes have
often been undertaken on an ad hoc basis and are not
sufficiently linked to employability-enhancing measures in support of the working poor (Peyron Bista and
Carter, 2017).
Public employment programmes can serve several
development objectives (investment, employment and
social protection), but their lack of a clearly defined
main objective can limit their effectiveness in providing
adequate social protection (ILO, 2014a). Taking into
account that such programmes do not address those
who are permanently or temporarily unable to work,
or for whom work is not available, several countries
(including Ethiopia and South Africa) have taken deliberate steps to emphasize social protection objectives
in their programmes and have combined employment
guarantee schemes with unconditional transfers for
those groups (McCord, 2012). While such programmes
may provide a source of social protection for people
not covered by unemployment insurance, they can run
into the danger of leaving workers unprotected once
the programme ends. Complementary measures such
as training can be effective in securing the return of
participants to non-subsidized employment once the
programme ends (ILO, 2016g). Public employment
programmes will only reduce poverty and achieve
greater equity in the long term if they are designed in
such a way as to emphasize decent work components,
including an adequate level of wages, an integral skills
development component and full respect for the occupational safety and health of workers, while also guaranteeing beneficiaries access to social security benefits
and health care (ILO, 2014a).

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

3.3.6 Strengthening the link between
unemployment protection and active
labour market and employment-generating
macroeconomic policies
In light of the persistent high levels of unemployment
as well as vulnerable employment and working poverty
in many countries, strengthening the link between
income support and active labour market policies has
become a recent global trend. This stems from the
recognition that providing isolated income support
may not improve individuals’ employment or social
situation when labour markets are rapidly changing
or when individuals face barriers to (re-)employment
(ILO, 2017a; Martin, 2014). Such policies are considered effective in activating and motivating unemployed
workers to find suitable employment quickly. Their initial objective to (re)integrate unemployed workers into
the labour market has been widened to, for instance,
include support in facilitating workers’ transition
from one sector to another, maintain workers’ incomes in times of recession, or top up wages of vulnerable groups. In general, they consist of a combination
of measures aimed at matching jobseekers, upgrading and adapting their skills and stimulating job creation; measures include direct job search assistance and
career guidance, training and skills development, and
employment and wage subsidies (ILO, 2016g; Peyron
Bista and Carter, 2017).
Several countries have promoted strategies to provide jobseekers and recipients of unemployment benefits
with better access to training, retraining, certification
and job matching (e.g. Netherlands, 26 Portugal, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia and Viet Nam); personalized support (e.g. Denmark, Latvia and the United
Kingdom); and support in complying with job search
and activity requirements (Spain). Other countries, for
example Estonia, have expanded job assistance and job
counselling services to support workers in retaining
their employment. In other countries, such as Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Japan,

Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia,
South Africa and the United States, subsidized employment as well as credit provision have been used to incentivize employers to hire unemployed workers and to
create jobs.
In addition to supporting individuals in finding
more decent and productive employment and enhancing job quality, such measures can also improve equity
by targeting disadvantaged groups that face barriers to
employment, due for example to vulnerabilities associated with lower income levels, lack of basic skills, or discrimination (ILO, 2016g). In this context, programmes
have been directed toward specific groups, including
older workers (Austria, 27 Lithuania and Singapore),
persons with disabilities (Germany, Luxembourg and
Poland), parents with young children (including in Bulgaria, Japan, Malta, Pakistan and Russian Federation),
women (Spain and Poland 28), and the long-term unemployed (Cyprus, Bulgaria,29 France, Ireland, Latvia,
Malta, Portugal, Spain and Slovakia). In many regions
(e.g. Latin America and the Caribbean), the increased
support for active labour market policies alongside the
expansion of unemployment protection schemes, including non-contributory schemes, has played a major
role in tackling poverty and inequality and improving
employment outcomes (Escudero, 2015; ILO, 2016g;
Martin, 2014).30
Active labour market policies have often been
undertaken as part of efforts to strengthen the link
between active and passive labour market policies and,
more broadly, to offer integrated employment and
social protection policies (e.g. in Argentina, Brazil,
Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea and Viet Nam; see
box 3.14). These measures are aimed at bringing recipients of unemployment benefits and other social assistance benefits under a common framework of activation
policies and at improving the quality and outreach of
services (ILO, 2014a; Peyron Bista and Carter, 2017).
For example, Mongolia and Finland31 have merged the
administration of social protection and employment
services into a “one-stop shop” through a single window

26
The newly introduced Brug-WW programme offers retraining measures to facilitate the transition from shrinking to growing sectors of
the economy (European Commission, 2015a).
27
The measures include wage subsidies and retraining measures to update skills (European Commission, 2015a).
28
New measures in Poland, in force since 2014, include vocational activation of women, such as the provision of an activation benefit for
employers who hire unemployed workers who had breaks due to child-raising or care responsibilities (European Commission, 2015a).
29
The newly approved programme for Training and Employment of Long-Term Unemployed provides training and job creation measures.
30
The effect of active labour market policies on poverty can be stronger in emerging and developing economies, as the poverty-alleviation
function of these policies is generally targeted more to the most vulnerable groups rather than strictly the unemployed, as in OECD
countries (ILO, 2016g).
31
Finland has set up a one-stop shop for young workers (European Commission, 2016).

55

service approach, thereby linking the delivery of social
protection and employment services.
Such policies have proved to be instrumental in
reducing long-term exclusion of unemployed workers
from the labour market, taking into consideration that
discouraged workers may cease to be registered with
employment services (ILO, 2014b). While measures
targeted at specific groups may have an important redistributive effect, some concerns have been expressed that
in the absence of employability-enhancing components,
for example, they may reinforce stigma and lead to lockin effects during participation (ILO, 2016h).
Despite being intended to facilitate the return to
work of unemployed workers, such policies may exclude
or discriminate against certain groups of beneficiaries
and restrict effective access to benefits, taking into account that a requirement to participate can also imply

56

stricter control of the provision of benefits and a tightening of entitlement conditions. Careful design and
implementation of activation measures are therefore necessary to ensure that these do not lead to unintended
effects (ILO, 2014d).
Even activation policies may not have the expected
impact on job creation where jobs are not available and
the economy is demand-constrained, especially during
a recession. For this reason, effective policies are needed
to ensure at least a basic level of income security during
periods of unemployment and underemployment, combined with effective labour market, employment and
skills development policies, as well as macroeconomic
policies that promote jobs to restore labour demand and
lift countries out of the low growth and low employment trap (Ocampo and Jomo, 2007; Stiglitz, 2009;
ILO, 2014c, 2017b).

3.4  Employment injury protection
KEY MESSAGES
nn
Extending the coverage on employment injury protection contributes to SDG 1.3. Effective coverage
of workers under employment injury insurance (EII) is still significantly low in most low- and middleincome countries due to weak enforcement of schemes, where they exist.
nn
As a result, the large majority of workers in low- and middle-income countries are not protected in
case of employment-related accidents and diseases. There is a wide array of workplace cultural practices for handling cases of employment injuries through discretionary approaches. Efforts are made
to document and address such practices, guided by social insurance principles.
nn
Thirty-six countries still depend on direct employer liability compensation in case of injuries at work
and in the absence of EII systems, especially in Africa and Asia and the Pacific.
nn
A growing number of countries are exploring reforms that move away from employer liability systems
towards adopting and implementing EII systems following social security principles as contained in
ILO Conventions Nos 102 and 121; this is expected to improve effective coverage in particular in
sectors facing relatively more hazardous occupations and in small and medium enterprises, and to
enhance levels of protection.
nn
The cost of employment injury benefits and safety and health at work, including prevention and rehabilitation of injured workers, is normally factored in as part of the overall cost of production.
nn
Safety and health at work can benefit from policy synergies integrated into the framework of
employment injury benefits for all workers; the challenge of extending employment injury protection
to workers in the informal economy remains of high importance, while innovative approaches are
explored, such as through cooperative and associative intermediaries.
nn
Many low-income countries involved in global supply chains, such as those in the garment, textile and
leather sectors, are keen to effectively implement the coverage of employment injury insurance but
remain hesitant, considering the estimated cost too high at around 1 per cent of wages; this sheds
light on the competitive context of global supply chains. Efforts are still needed for the acceptance
of the cost of social security in general.

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

3.4.1 Protecting workers in case
of employment injury
Employment injury benefit schemes, providing benefits
in cash and in kind in cases of work-related accidents
and diseases, constitute the oldest branch of social security in many countries. These schemes were established to address one of the key challenges in modern
workplaces. Employers are responsible for securing the
occupational safety and health of their workers and
providing fair, equitable and effective compensation to
workers and, in the event of their death, to their dependent survivors. This is intended to make good any
loss of income as a consequence of employment-related
accidents or diseases and to facilitate injured workers’
access to the necessary health care, including medical
and allied care services and goods, and physical as well
as vocational rehabilitation services. Where such mechanisms are not in place, the only hope of redress for a
person injured at work, or for his/her survivors, lies in
action against the employer in the ordinary courts. Lawsuits of this type are generally lengthy, expensive and
stressful for victims, and are therefore rarely ­efficient
in providing effective compensation to injured workers
and the family or other dependants of deceased workers.
Non-adversarial schemes were thus introduced in
a number of countries at an early stage, with a view
to ensuring the timely provision of benefits to injured
workers and their dependants, the establishment of
predictable and sustainable financing mechanisms, and
the efficient administration of funds. The first generation of such schemes consisted in “workmen’s compensation schemes”, under which the compensation of
a worker or his/her surviving family dependants is a
legal liability placed upon the employer. Underpinning
this approach is the principle that employers must provide their workers with a safe and healthy working environment, and that failure to do so renders them liable
for the consequent losses suffered by workers or their
family members. Given that the financial burden of
meeting this obligation rests solely on employers, these
schemes often require them to take out private insurance. Experience has shown, however, that even where
such an obligation exists in law, the outcomes of these
schemes are often sub-optimal. The need to submit
an insurance claim, involving the need to obtain relevant information and undergo rigorous medical assessments, can cause serious delays in obtaining treatment
and benefits. In addition, an employer may be reluctant
to make a claim for fear of other legal implications.
Since the employer may not continue his/her business

and the private insurer does not want to provide benefits for a long time, benefits are in the form of a lump
sum or, even in the case of periodic payments, are paid
for a definite period without indexation. In recognition
of these drawbacks, many countries have replaced employer liability provisions with social insurance, which
in effect extends the no-fault principle to share the
costs of employment injury among employers.
This shift in approach to employment injury protection has been reflected in the standards adopted by the
ILO from its early days (see box 3.15).
The effectiveness of programmes in addressing
employment injury relies on a specific set of principles:
1. “no fault”, namely a worker who is injured, or his/
her survivor(s) in case of death, should qualify for
benefits without any necessity to prove “fault” of the
employer;
2. collective sharing of liability among employers; and
3. neutral governance of administration of the scheme,
meaning that the right to benefit is established outside the contractual relationship between a worker
and his/her employer.
Within this framework, the aim of employment injury
provisions in most countries is to meet the needs of disabled workers or of the dependent family members of
workers who have died due to employment-related in­
juries and diseases, by way of:
• appropriate and relevant medical and allied care for
injured workers;
• earnings-related periodic cash benefits to disabled
workers, whose disability is assessed as temporary or
permanent and partial or total in case of permanent
disability; and
• earnings-related periodic cash benefits and funeral
grants to survivors of deceased workers, namely
widows and widowers, children and other dependent relatives.
Many national employment injury schemes have a set of
wider aims, such as the re-employment of injured or sick
workers, and the promotion and maintenance of decent
levels of safety and health in the workplace. These objectives can only be achieved effectively if there is a high
level of policy integration between employment injury
schemes and policies relating to labour markets, labour
inspection and occupational safety and health.
The provision of adequate compensation in case
of permanent partial disability represents one of the

Box 3.15  International standards relevant to employment injury protection

58

The right to protection against employment injury
is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (UDHR), 1948, and the International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR),
1966. The realization of this right requires the application of safe and healthy working conditions; the
prevention, treatment and control of occupational diseases; and the provision of adequate benefits, in cash
or in kind, that ensure access to adequate health
care and income security for victims of employment
injury and their dependent family members.1
Protection from employment injury has been
the object of a number of Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO from its early
days. According to Convention No. 102 (Part VI),
any condition that impacts negatively on health and
which is due to a work accident or an occupational
disease, and the incapacity to work and earn that
results from it, whether temporary or permanent,
total or partial, must be covered. The protection also
includes, where a worker dies as a consequence of
an employment injury or occupational disease, the
loss of support suffered by her or his dependants.
Accordingly, the provision must include medical and
allied care, with a view to maintaining, restoring or
improving the health of the injured person and her
or his ability to work and attend to personal needs.
A cash benefit must also be paid to the injured
person or his/her dependants, as the case may
be, at a guaranteed level and on a periodic basis,
serving an income replacement or support function.
Where the disability is slight, the benefit can under
certain conditions be paid as a lump sum.
The Employment Injury Benefits Convention, 1964
(No. 121), and its accompanying Recommendation,
No. 121, set higher standards, mainly in terms of

population coverage and level of benefits to be provided (see Annex III). Convention No. 121 also recognizes the importance of an integrated approach in
improving working conditions, limiting the impact of
employment injuries and facilitating the reintegration
of persons with disabilities in the labour market and
in society; for such purposes this Convention requires
the State to take measures to prevent employment
injuries, provide rehabilitation services and ensure
that displaced workers find suitable re-employment.
The approach taken by Recommendation No. 202
is different, reflecting its focus on preventing or alleviating poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion
through income security guarantees rather than
on specific life risks; as such, it recognizes sickness and disability, in whatever cause or degree,
as a potential source of financial insecurity which
should be addressed, in so far as it prevents people
of working age from earning sufficient income. In
the same way, Recommendation No. 202 calls for
guaranteed access to at least essential health care
for all in need, over the life cycle, irrespective of the
origin of the disability or ill health for which such
care is required. Basic income security and access
to essential health care can be ensured through a
variety of approaches, combining contributory and
non-contributory schemes and different types of
benefits, such as disability and employment injury
benefits as well as other social benefits, in cash or
in kind. Particularly relevant to employment injury
protection is the Recommendation’s further call for
the combination of preventative, promotional and
active measures with benefits and social services,
and the coordination of social protection policies
with policies that promote, among other things, secure work within a decent work framework.

UDHR, Art. 25(1); ICESCR, Art. 7 (b), 12 (b) and (c). See also ICESCR, General Comment No. 19, “The right to social

greatest challenges in the employment injury branch
of social protection. An approach which focuses on
the loss of bodily function tends to compensate essentially for the physical loss and may result in either overor under-compensation from the economic viewpoint
of a disabled worker, even if the degree of disability
is not assessed exclusively on the basis of medical factors. An approach based on earning capacity attempts
to relate the level of benefit to the economic loss arising from the injury; this imposes demanding administrative requirements for the management of claims,
and needs to be complemented by well-developed rehabilitation services in order to develop the residual
capacities of injured workers. This in turn requires
the full engagement of employers in the rehabilitation
programme.

A rating system of contributions, by considering the
past performance of employers in respect of occupational injuries and diseases, is used to provide an incentive to employers in preventing such injuries and
diseases as well as facilitating the return to work of injured workers. However, this is usually possible only for
medium-sized and large firms, where a critical mass of
employment as well as accidents exists, so that accidents
are relatively stable over time. This practice is predominantly applied in high-income countries.
When it comes to implementation, another important criterion for measuring the effectiveness of
employment injury schemes is the ability of the system
to ensure that injured workers have access to healthcare facilities, goods and services, and that cash benefits reach injured workers and survivors of deceased

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

workers without delay. This explains the low levels of
coverage and public awareness of compensation health
benefits in countries where health systems are insufficiently developed in the first place, such as in Western and Central Africa. Timely delivery of benefits
requires effective reporting systems of occupational
accidents and diseases, and simple and efficient claim
procedures for injured workers and survivors of deceased workers. Online reporting systems of occupational accidents and diseases help to facilitate the
access to benefits.
The establishment of financially sustainable and administratively efficient employment injury schemes is
a step towards ensuring effective access to cash benefits and medical and allied care by injured workers and
families of injured and deceased workers. Employment injury benefits prevent these persons from falling
into poverty and therefore contribute to SDG 1, “End
poverty in all its forms everywhere”.
3.4.2 Types of employment injury
protection schemes
The majority of countries adopt a social insurance approach to compensation for employment injuries and
occupational diseases, although some countries retain

some elements of an employer liability approach so
that workers who are not compulsorily included in
such schemes should be also compensated directly by
employers. In a very few countries, for example in the
Netherlands, employment injury coverage is fully integrated into schemes providing coverage for non-workrelated disabilities.
Figure 3.21 illustrates the patterns of coverage
worldwide. It can be seen that the emphasis on social
insurance, as opposed to first-generation schemes operating under employer liability, is higher in Europe,
Central Asia and the Arab States, and lower in the
Americas, Africa, and Asia and the Pacific. In Africa,
employer liability provisions are still in place in a
number of countries, such as Botswana, The Gambia,
Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Morocco, Sierra Leone, South
Africa, Swaziland and Uganda. However, some of these
countries are making efforts to implement a social insurance mechanism for providing employment injury
benefits. For example, the Government of Malawi is
making efforts to replace the employer liability system
of the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1946 by the
Workers Compensation Act No. 7 of 2000, which provides for the establishment and administration of a
Workers’ Compensation Fund based on the principles
of social insurance (ILO, 2017e). Kenya is attempting
to reform its direct employer liability system by a social

the situation remains dire; day-to-day work accidents
often translate into households at risk of poverty. There
is clear competitive pressure coming from the limited
profit margins in the export industries and national
producers, who are keen to retain their low labour cost
profile to increase the share of exports from Bangladesh
at the international level. On 1 June 2015, the Government of Bangladesh adopted a National Social Security
Strategy, whose key components include the establishment of a mandatory National Social Insurance Scheme
(NSIS) based on the principle of employers and employees jointly paying contributions into a national insurance fund for work injury.32
3.4.3  Effective coverage
Despite efforts to extend EII coverage to more workers,
the number of workers registered for employment
injury schemes is much smaller than the number
of those covered by law in many middle- and lowincome countries (see figure 3.22). This is due to a
number of reasons. For example, in Indonesia all employees (except public sector employees for whom a
special system exists) and self‑employed persons are
covered by legislation under the social security scheme.

insurance system, including the development of a compensation fund (ILO, forthcoming c).
In Asia and the Pacific, an employer liability system
is still in place in countries such as Bangladesh, Brunei
Darussalam, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Industrial accidents
such as the Rana Plaza building collapse in Bangladesh
revealed the devastating consequences of not having in
place a public employment injury insurance scheme.
This is of utmost concern, as large accidents in recent
years have often affected small and medium-sized enterprises that could not afford to pay large amounts of
compensation under employer liability when workplace
tragedies occurred. In Bangladesh, the exporting industries in the ready-made garment and textile sectors are
most concerned to see a rapid change to avoid ever witnessing another Rana Plaza tragedy. In the meantime,
the Government has set up a Central Fund funded
from levies on export volumes and aiming to provide
different types of benefits and services on a discretionary basis, including one-off compensation in case of
work injuries, but not exclusively. It is applied to factory
workers engaged in the export-oriented ready-made
garment sector and aims to provide a limited solution
until the national employment injury protection and
rehabilitation scheme is in place. For workers in non-export garment factories and in all other economic sectors

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Nevertheless, the effective coverage, measured as the
total number of registered workers divided by the
labour force, is around 15 per cent.33 Possible reasons
for this low effective coverage include low enforcement
capacities of the scheme, low contributory capacities
of employers and employees, a lack of understanding
of social insurance, a mismatch between benefits and
needs, or overly complex administrative procedures
that could hamper participation.
Efforts to expand coverage are under way in some
countries. In India, the Employees’ State Insurance
Scheme, which provides employment injury benefits
among other benefits, extended coverage to construction workers in 2015.34 In Cambodia, the Employment
Injury Insurance Scheme has been gradually extended
to 24 provinces nationwide and in 2018 will be extended further from the current coverage of enterprises
or establishments employing eight workers or more to
those employing one worker or more. Efforts are being
made to extend coverage to more workers, including
workers in the construction sector.35
While the reporting of work-related injuries is measured or estimated in most countries, there is nearly no

statistical measurement in place to monitor the proportion of injured workers who are effectively compensated. This is an effort in high need of attention in
view of SDG 1.3 calling for the coverage of employed
workers in case of work injury. Some middle-income
countries have extended coverage. For example, the
Social Security Organization (SOCSO) of Malaysia
is gradually extending its coverage to almost half the
labour force, estimated at 43.7 per cent in 2014 and
44.0 per cent in 2015.36 Many developed countries have
reached a high level of effective coverage; for example,
in Spain, the effective coverage rate was estimated at
around 76 per cent of the labour force in 2016.
3.4.4  Adequacy of benefits
Employment injury benefits for permanently disabled
workers are usually provided in the form of pensions,
namely periodic payments with cost-of-living adjustments. Replacement rates, defined as benefits as a percentage of pre-disablement earnings, differ considerably,
as shown in figure 3.23. The same applies to temporary

incapacity benefits, as shown in figure 3.24, with further variations in benefit duration.
Some technical aspects of social insurance lead
to substantial deterioration of benefits. One example
is a ceiling on insurable earnings of social insurance
schemes, which is usually set to limit the earnings subject to contributions and benefit calculations in order to
delimit the range where social insurance applies. A ceiling should be set high enough so that benefits as well
as contributions become meaningful. A ceiling that is
not set high enough or has become too low due to infrequent or inexistent adjustments in line with economic
development leads to insignificant benefits as well as
contributions, as seen in Pakistan’s Sindh Province and
in Zambia.
3.4.5 Recent developments: Extending
employment injury insurance
Employer liability schemes contain minimal provisions for benefits and services to workers suffering
occupational injuries or diseases; this leaves workers
in a vulnerable position whenever an injury occurs,
often fearing for the loss of their employment. Employment injury insurance is more aligned with the general
intent of ILO social security standards, such as the
Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention,
1952 (No. 102), and the Employment Injury Benefits
Convention, 1964 (No. 121), and its accompanying

Recommendation (No. 121). Countries with the employer liability provisions enforced by each individual
employer generally have difficulties in effectively covering all employees in accordance with the law, and many
injured workers or dependants of deceased workers do
not receive proper compensation in response to their
needs. Workers in small and medium-sized enterprises
are the most prone to injuries, given the more limited
resources available for prevention and the frequently
high staff turnover that discourages some employers
from investing in the training of their workforce in
prevention.
For this reason, a number of developing countries
are keen to establish an EII scheme. Some countries in
Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, including Japan, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Philippines and Thailand,
have a long history of implementing and gradually expanding coverage in case of employment injury, while
others, such as Cambodia and Lao People’s Democratic Republic, have recently introduced EII schemes.
A number of countries are exploring how to extend
coverage to self‑employed workers, although specific alternatives for such groups are normally challenging to
develop. Some countries in Southern Asia, such as India
and Pakistan, have provincial EII schemes in place, but
the coverage is still limited given employment practices
that often lead to under-reporting or lack of compliance in registering workers. Nepal and Sri Lanka have
not yet implemented an EII scheme in spite of efforts
to introduce a system; Bangladesh’s Prime Minister and

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

tripartite partners are committed to establishing a national EII protection and rehabilitation scheme.
Recent large-scale industrial accidents such as the
Rana Plaza building collapse in Bangladesh in April
2013 in which over 1,000 workers lost their lives and
around 2,500 were injured, and the Baldia factory
fire in September 2012 in Karachi, Pakistan, in which
more than 255 workers died and more than 50 workers
were injured, have revealed that many workers were
not properly covered in case of employment injury (see
box 3.16). Although the ILO facilitates ad hoc compensation arrangements to ensure that the minimum
rights of affected workers are met, long-term solutions
are sought by either establishing a proper EII scheme or
improving the design and the administration of an existing scheme to effectively enforce legal coverage, as in
the Sindh Province of Pakistan.
In Africa, countries such as Ethiopia, Malawi and
the United Republic of Tanzania have recently introduced EII schemes or are in the process of doing so, as
such a scheme is considered to be a solution to chronic
problems of coverage and benefit inadequacy for injured workers or dependants of deceased workers (ILO,
2015b). A recent ILO study surveyed the practices observed in Southern African countries and pointed to
the inherent deficiencies and the urgency of expanding employment injury protection (Mpedi and Nyenti,
2016). This is especially relevant in the extractive industries and agro-food sectors and in Africa in general, as
its booming national developments rely on large construction and infrastructure projects where accidents
are more frequent and severe.
The demand for capacity building in developing
countries, especially in Africa and Asia, is increasing
in such areas as financial and institutional governance,
management and information systems, processing of
claims, assessment of disabilities, administration of
health and allied care and rehabilitation services, as
well as interlinkages between compensation, prevention and labour inspection. Employers and workers at
the sectoral level recognize the importance of linking
compensation with prevention and inspection compliance policies.
The global trend towards coverage under social insurance is encouraging. Such a framework helps to
promote the principles of rights and solidarity essential to the long-term sustainability of social protection
systems. Experience rating systems for contributions
are good mechanisms for providing the right incentives to employers for better prevention and rehabilitation. However, sophisticated administrative structures,

proper inspections and good data management are
required.
Complex issues may arise in the treatment of occupational diseases with long latency periods. While
determining the time of occurrence of a work accident may not be problematic, determining the onset of
an occupational disease may be more difficult. Many
workers are currently exposed to working conditions
that may lead to the development of an occupational
disease over a long period of time. Such problems can
be even more difficult to manage in the circumstances
of developing countries where relevant regulations, for
example with respect to protective clothing and other
safeguarding measures, may be poorly enforced.
In countries which have put in place employment
injury insurance and workers’ compensation schemes
to address these needs, it is important that the schemes
be administered on a fair and consistent basis. Medical examinations, diagnoses and assessments must
be rigorous and based on a national list of occupational diseases. Such lists, however, may not always
be seen as sympathetic to claimants, and tend to reflect a particular set of national or local conditions and
perceptions.
Providing protection in cases of employment injury
is an area of social security in which effective administration and equitable treatment of workers play a particularly crucial role. The role of administrators may be
very wide and closely interrelated with that of labour
inspectors responsible for checking workplace safety
as well as the whole range of measures to help prevent
accidents at work, occupational injuries and diseases.
An integrated framework comprising comprehensive
occupational safety and health measures, strong inspection services and enforcement measures, as well
as adequate cash and health-care benefits in the event
of employment injuries, accompanied by appropriate
rehabilitation services, remains the best way to ensure
that workers and their family dependants are effectively
protected against the risks of employment injury.
Migrant workers form a group vulnerable to discrimination. They account for an important segment
of the informal economy in all regions and are concentrated in low-skilled jobs, particularly in agriculture,
construction, small manufacturing, domestic work and
other services. These activities are often temporary,
seasonal and casual work, frequently subcontracted,
and are often inadequately covered by labour regulation and inspection. Migrant workers are thus likely
to be excluded from social security coverage, due to
restrictive legislation and a lack of enforcement. Some

Box 3.16  Some recent industrial accidents in Bangladesh and Pakistan:
The Rana Plaza and the Ali Enterprises disasters and the bridging solution
for social security in cases of employment injury
The Rana Plaza disaster, Savar, Bangladesh

64

On 24 April 2013, the collapse of the Rana Plaza
building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which housed five
garment factories, killed at least 1,132 people and
injured more than 2,500. Only five months earlier,
at least 112 workers had lost their lives in another
tragic accident, trapped inside the burning Tazreen
Fashions factory on the outskirts of Dhaka. These
disasters, among the worst industrial accidents on
record, awoke the world to the poor labour conditions faced by workers in the ready-made garment sector in Bangladesh. For some of the lowest
wages of the world, millions of people, most of them
girls and women, are exposed every day to an unsafe work environment with a high incidence of
work-related accidents and deaths, as well as occupational diseases. Most of the factories do not meet
standards required by building and construction
legislation. As a result, deaths from fire incidents
and building collapses are frequent.
Since the Rana Plaza disaster, no fewer than
109 accidents have occurred. Among these, at
least 35 were textile factory incidents in which 491
workers were injured and 27 lost their lives. In the
absence of a well-functioning labour inspection
system and of appropriate enforcement mechanisms, decent work and life in dignity are still far
from reality for the vast majority of workers in the
garment industry and their families.
Given the hazardous working conditions and
the high risk of exposure to employment injury in
this sector, the provision of adequate benefits is of
critical importance in compensating injured workers
for the loss of earnings they are likely to suffer, and
to ensure that they have access to the medical and
associated care required by their condition. Access
to some form of financial compensation or support
for dependent family members who lose their breadwinner can also make the difference between life in
dire poverty, where children and older people are
forced to work to survive, and life at or just above
subsistence level. At present, the only form of financial protection available to workers and their
dependants is set out in the labour code, which requires employers, when liable, to provide specified
payments to injured workers or survivors.
A recent amendment to the labour code requires
employers to insure themselves against liability,
but no such obligation was in force at the time
Tazreen caught fire, or when Rana Plaza collapsed.
The amounts of compensation envisaged are also
very low and take the form of lump sums, offering
inadequate protection to beneficiaries against ill

health and poverty in the medium and long term.
The system is also plagued by major practical application issues (e.g. evasion, lack of proper enforcement, absence of effective recourse), with the result
that legal entitlements very rarely materialize.
Despite the magnitude of the losses suffered by
the victims of the Tazreen and Rana Plaza accidents
and their survivors, no compensation was paid in
application of the labour code provisions on employer liability. A small number of global buyers and
local players made some payments to victims in the
months following the disasters, albeit on a voluntary
basis. To redress the situation more substantively
and ensure that injured workers and dependants
of the deceased were effectively compensated,
both financially and in respect of medical and other
relevant care, global and local stakeholders got together and agreed to an unprecedented coordinated
framework. With the ILO acting as a neutral chair,
an Arrangement was adopted, providing a single approach to compensation consistent with ILO standards, and more specifically with the Employment
Injury Benefits Convention, 1964 (No. 121).1

The bridging solution for social security
in case of employment injury
Following a number of recent tragedies such as
the Tampoco and MultiFabs factory fires in 2016
and 2017, as well as earlier accidents such as the
Tazreen fire and the Rana Plaza disaster, local authorities and stakeholders at the national and international levels, with the involvement of organizations
such as the IndustriAll Global Union and Clean
Clothes Campaign, took bold steps to strengthen
occupational safety and health, labour inspection
services, skills training and rehabilitation services
in the long term, notably with the support of the ILO
and of global buyers. Action has also been taken to
implement a national employment injury scheme in
Bangladesh based on the principles of Convention
No. 121 and a mutual consensus on the core
elements of the scheme. The operationalization of
an EII scheme will inevitably take time, possibly two
to three years at best. Until an EII scheme becomes
operational and capable of collecting contributions
and paying benefits, it is crucial that in case of
another large-scale industrial accident such as the
Rana Plaza collapse or the Tazreen building fire, a
proper bridging solution be in place to provide for
appropriate health care and compensation to the
victims in an efficient and diligent manner and on a
temporary basis.

The Ali Enterprises factory fire,
Baldia, Sindh province, Pakistan
In the factory fire on 11 September 2012 at Ali
Enterprises in Baldia Town Karachi, Pakistan, more
than 255 workers died and over 50 were injured.
Despite the fact that employment injury compensation legislation in Pakistan is generally in line with
many of the principles of Convention No. 121, deficits in compliance with social security and labour
laws and regulations resulted in low effective coverage. For example, it was reported that only about
235 workers at Ali Enterprises were effectively
registered, non-nominatively, with Sindh Employees’
Social Security Institution (SESSI) despite a reported
total number of over 1,500 workers employed and
working; SESSI coverage is reported to be as low as
5–10 per cent of all workers normally expected to be
legally covered. Furthermore, the legislative provisions that set maximum insurable earnings equal
only to the minimum wage for unskilled workers,
and the lack of guaranteed indexation, result in inadequate employment injury benefits. Lack of confidence in existing social security institutions is one
1

of the reasons why victims of the Ali Enterprises fire
asked for lump-sum payments rather than periodic
benefits.
An agreement similar to the Rana Plaza Arrangement has been adopted for Pakistan, including the
financing by international partners of the funding gap
to cover compensation benefits and services to be
delivered to the victims, based on Convention No.
121 and other relevant international labour standards
such as Convention No. 102 (Part VI). The ILO has
undertaken consultations to propose options for the
part of the project dealing with Ali Enterprises victims’
compensation, with a view to establishing a supervisory and delivery mechanism (such as an oversight
committee with a clear role and responsibilities and
defined membership) and to prepare for decisions on
numerous outstanding issues such as, among others,
meeting the expectations of victims, the trust fund
modalities and long-term management, and the capacities of existing institutions including the SESSI and
other relevant institutions such as the federal Employees’ Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI), as well
as the social partners, for the delivery of benefits,
taking into account Pakistan’s specificities.

countries cover migrant workers but provide lower
benefits. Employment injury and short-term benefits
(e.g. cash death benefits and sickness benefits) may be
easier to extend than long-term benefits (e.g. retirement benefits or end‑of-service gratuities) as eligibility for the former depends on the current contributory
status, while in the latter, contribution conditions are
more difficult to fulfil. Covering migrant workers necessitates appropriate policy design and considerable
organizational efforts; the issue is often sensitive, requiring effective communication by public authorities
to the workers and the wider population. Protecting
the rights of migrant workers includes equal treatment
in social security coverage and entitlements, and the
maintenance and portability of social security rights
through bilateral or multilateral treaties (ILO, forthcoming d).

The prevalence of the informal economy in many
parts of the world, and the pervasive trends towards
higher levels of precarious and informal employment,
not only affect the current living standards and working conditions of the population but also prevent
households and economic units in the informal economy from increasing their productivity, reducing their
vulnerabilities and finding a route out of poverty. A
coherent national strategy to facilitate transitions to
formality needs to recognize that the costs of working informally are high for businesses, workers and the
community. Ensuring employment injury protection
of vulnerable groups such as informal workers would
greatly contribute to the employment injury coverage of all workers by social protection systems, including floors, and would help to achieve the indicator of
SDG target 1.3.

Effective social protection measures to protect persons with disabilities and promote independent
living and access to decent work are a precondition for achieving the SDGs and human rights.
nn
Latest ILO estimates of effective coverage show that 27.8 per cent of persons with severe disabilities
worldwide receive a disability benefit, with large regional variation: while coverage in Eastern Europe
appears to be almost universal, regional estimates for Asia and the Pacific show an effective coverage
rate of only 9.4 per cent.

Disability-inclusive social protection systems guarantee effective access to mainstream schemes for
persons with disabilities, combined with disability benefits and support services that address their
specific needs.

Universal social protection for persons with disabilities has been achieved in Brazil, Chile, Mongolia
and Uruguay, and other developing countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, Nepal and South Africa, are
progressing to extend disability benefits. At the same time, other countries are cutting rights-based
universal disability benefits as part of short-term fiscal consolidation policies, narrow-targeting to the
poor only and leaving many persons with disabilities without support.
nn
Disability benefits should be designed in a way that enables persons with disabilities to actively
participate in education, employment and society at large. This can be achieved through ensuring
that benefits in cash and in kind cover disability-related costs and enable persons with disabilities to
participate in salaried employment.
nn
The collection of administrative data disaggregated by disability status is necessary for the effective
monitoring of social protection systems, contributing to both the development of evidence-based policies and the implementation of the SDGs.

3.5.1 Protecting persons with disabilities
to ensure employment, income security
and independent living
Social protection for persons with disabilities is a precondition for achieving the SDGs, which explicitly
refer to them in several targets and indicators. The
2030 Agenda explicitly refers to persons with disabilities with regard to social protection systems, including floors (SDG target 1.3) and with regard to their
full engagement in productive employment and decent
work (SDG target 8.5). This holds member States accountable not only for ensuring effective access to social
protection for persons with disabilities, but also for promoting their economic empowerment and active participation in the labour market. No country would be

37

able to achieve the SDGs without having in place both
effective protection and promotion measures for persons with disabilities.
Persons with disabilities are exposed to multiple
risks throughout their life cycle. Children with disabilities are at high risk of being excluded from society,
including from mainstream education, due to stigma,
institutionalization practices or a lack of support services, and are often exposed to violence.38 Such exclusionary practices hamper their development and may
further exacerbate accumulated disadvantages, including with regard to education, skills development and
their ability to engage in skilled employment later in
life. Persons of working age with disabilities face higher
risks of unemployment, underemployment and informal employment (OHCHR, 2012b), which often

This section focuses mainly on general disability benefits, noting that employment injury benefits (see section 3.4 above) are also relevant
to some persons with disabilities.
38
Recent studies have found that persons with disabilities are exposed to violence four times more frequently than their peers (Jones et al.,
2012), and are 17 times more likely than their peers to be taken into institutional care in Central and Eastern Europe (UNICEF, 2012b).
A global estimate also shows that the completion rates of primary school for children with disabilities are lower by around 10 per cent than
those of other children (UNICEF, 2013). These findings indicate that children with disabilities are highly disadvantaged in physical, social
and economic development.

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.17  Disability benefits for income protection: Relevant international standards
The international human rights legal framework contains many explicit references to the right to social
protection of persons with disabilities. The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 1948, and
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights (ICESCR), 1966, contain a general
recognition of this right, while the UN Convention on
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) goes
into more detail.1 Together, they recognize the right
of persons with disabilities to an adequate standard
of living for themselves and their families, including
adequate food, clothing and housing, to the continuous improvement of living conditions, to social
security and to the highest attainable standard of
health. More specifically, according to the CRPD,
States must safeguard and promote the realization of
their right to social protection without discrimination
on the basis of disability, providing equal access to
appropriate and affordable services and devices and
other assistance with disability-related needs; social protection and poverty reduction programmes;
assistance with disability-related expenses; public
housing programmes; and retirement benefits and
programmes. The Convention also lays down the
right of persons with disabilities to the enjoyment
of the highest attainable standard of health without
discrimination on the basis of disability. To this end,
States must take all appropriate measures to ensure
access for persons with disabilities to health services
that are gender-sensitive, including health-related
rehabilitation.
In a complementar y way, successive standards adopted by the ILO set both basic minimum
and higher standards of income protection which
should be guaranteed to persons with disabilities
in replacement of the income they were earning
before disablement, or would have been earning
from employment had they been able to work. More
specifically, Convention No. 102 (Part IX – Invalidity
Benefit) deals with the contingency of total disablement (not due to an employment injury) which results in a person’s inability to engage in any gainful
activity and which is likely to be permanent. In these
circumstances, protection is to be provided through
periodic cash benefits, subject to certain conditions.
The Invalidity, Old-Age and Survivors’ Benefits Convention, 1967 (No. 128), in its Part II, deals with
the same subject matter but sets higher standards
for disability benefits schemes. Its accompanying
Recommendation, No. 131 2 broadens the definition

of the contingencies that should be covered under
national schemes by including partial disability,
which should give rise to a reduced benefit, and
by introducing the incapacity to engage in an activity involving substantial gain among the criteria
for disability assessments. Convention No. 128 also
requires the provision of rehabilitation services designed to enable persons with disabilities to either
resume their employment or perform another activity suited to their aptitudes.
Although medical care, including medical rehabilitation, is dealt with in separate provisions in Convention No. 102 (Part II) and the Medical Care and
Sickness Benefits Convention, 1969 (No. 130) –
discussed at greater length in Chapter 5 – a comprehensive, coherent and integrated approach to
disability benefits, such as the one set forth in the
ILO’s normative framework, requires that equal attention be given to the income support and medical needs of persons with disabilities. Hence, the
standards set as regards the provision of medical
care, including medical rehabilitation, 3 are highly
relevant; such care should be “afforded with a view
to maintaining, restoring or improving [their] health
… and [their] ability to work and to attend to [their]
personal needs”.4 Convention No. 102 further requires the institution or government department administering medical care to cooperate with the general vocational rehabilitation services “with a view
to the re-establishment of handicapped persons in
suitable work” (Art. 35).
Recommendation No. 202 also puts forward an
integrated and comprehensive approach to social
protection and disability benefits, according to which
persons with disabilities should enjoy the same
guarantees of basic income security and access to
essential health care as other members of society
through national social protection floors. These
guarantees can be provided through a variety of
schemes (contributory and non-contributory) and
benefits (in cash or kind), as is most effective and
efficient in meeting the needs and circumstances
of persons with disabilities to allow them to live in
dignity. Some of the principles set out in the Recommendation are of particular relevance for persons
with disabilities, including the principles of nondiscrimination, gender equality and responsiveness
to special needs, as well as respect for the rights
and dignity of people covered by the social security
guarantees.

restricts their access to decent work, stable earnings and
capacity for independent living. For many older persons, disability is a reality, given that the prevalence of
disabilities increases with age, resulting in a high proportion of older persons with disabilities particularly in

the age group 55 and above (WHO and World Bank,
2011). These risks contribute to the fact that persons
with disabilities tend to face higher poverty risks, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (Banks
and Polack, 2014).

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

3.5.2  Types of disability benefit schemes
Disability benefit schemes offer short- or long-term
assistance in cash or in kind, depending upon the recipient’s needs and requirements. Many countries provide
for a combined package of cash and in‑kind benefits such as free and adapted public transport, access
to other public services free of charge and free or subsidized assistive devices. While these benefits in kind
have a monetary value that potentially contribute to
guaranteeing income security, this section of the chapter focuses on cash benefits, which account for the majority of disability benefits.
Among 186 countries for which information is
available, the large majority (170 countries) have a
scheme anchored in national legislation providing periodic cash benefits to persons with disabilities, while
the remaining countries either provide for lump
sums only (13 countries) or have no such scheme anchored in law (3 countries) (figures 3.25 and 3.26).
Most countries (162) deliver benefits at least partly
through social insurance schemes, which generally

Social protection, and especially disability benefits, play a central role in combating these challenges,
in particular with regard to ensuring income security,
promoting employment and facilitating access to social
services such as education, health and public transport, as well as support services including social work,
childcare and the provision of assistive devices. By responding to disability-related and other needs, social
protection can foster the realization of SDGs and the
implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), complemented
by international social security standards (UN, 2015a)
(see box 3.17).39
These goals can be achieved through various means,
including social insurance and social assistance programmes; in fact, most countries already offer some
disability benefits. However, in order to effectively
accomplish the goals, disability benefit programmes
should be embedded in comprehensive national social
protection systems and ensure seamless support for persons with disabilities, including social protection and
employment promotion.

provide workers in the formal economy with earningsrelated disability benefits that aim to replace income
in case of full or partial disability; 67 countries provide for social assistance benefits with or without
means-testing, and 59 countries combine both contributory and non-­c ontributory schemes. Among
non-­c ontributory schemes, means-tested schemes
(41 countries) are slightly more common than universal schemes (29 countries), with three countries combining means‑tested and universal schemes.
This overview raises some concerns about the fact
that a large number of countries (103) provide for disability benefits only through contributory schemes.
Without a non-contributory scheme to complement
contributory provisions, persons outside the formal
economy, including children, may face difficulties in
meeting their disability-specific needs, even if they
may be eligible for some benefits under general social
assistance schemes. In addition, the high popularity of
means-testing disability benefits poses another challenge, as these may constitute serious poverty traps for

40

persons with disabilities, where access to disabilityrelated support is conditional on a means test which
often does not take into account d­ isability-specific
costs, and may discourage participation in employment
(see box 3.20). Removing or loosening means tests
on disability-specific benefits and support can help to
overcome adverse effects and enable persons with disabilities to participate more actively in employment as
well as in society at large.

3.5.4 Achieving universal social protection
for persons with disabilities: Recent
developments and challenges
Universal social protection for persons with disabilities is common in higher-income countries. In developing countries, universal coverage has been achieved
in Brazil, Chile, Mongolia and Uruguay, and others,
such as Kyrgyzstan, Nepal and South Africa are progressing to extend disability benefits (see Chapter 6 for
country and regional data). While a majority of countries are extending social protection, others are cutting
rights-based universal disability benefits as part of shortterm fiscal consolidation policies, narrow-targeting to
the poor only and leaving many persons with disabilities
without support.
In recent years, a number of low- and middle-income countries have introduced or improved non‑contributory disability benefits, or have included persons
with severe disabilities as one of the beneficiary groups
of broader cash transfer programmes (see box 3.18).
On the other hand, in contrast to these positive developments, a number of countries undergoing fiscal
consolidation have cut disability benefits. The Government of Greece, for instance, has replaced a large
number of existing social benefits, such as disability
and family benefits as well as the minimum pension
provided under social insurance schemes, by a safety
net for the poorest only, a single targeted guaranteed

minimum income scheme providing a relatively low
benefit and leaving most persons with disabilities without support. In other European countries, the introduction of means-testing for previously universal
benefits leaves many persons with disabilities without
support. The narrower targeting of disability benefits
on the poor erodes the principles of universal protection which used to be part of the social contract in
many European countries, based on legal rights. Fiscal
consolidation measures have restricted the access of
persons with disabilities to community living, education, primary care and assistance in a number of European countries (ILO, 2014a).
At the same time, the importance of disability inclusion in social protection has received greater attention
(e.g. UN, 2015a), focusing in particular on three issues.
First, social protection systems can play an important role in moving away from an incapacity-towork approach and enabling persons with disabilities
to actively participate in mainstream education and
employment. In many cases, however, countries provide
disability benefits only for persons who are deemed
unable to work (often requiring beneficiaries to prove
that they are unable to earn a livelihood), yet do not
provide the necessary support that would enable persons with disabilities to engage in employment. This
practice discourages persons with disabilities from
working. For the accomplishment of SDG target 8.5
on the promotion of employment and decent work,

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.18 Towards universalism: Extending non-contributory disability cash benefits in Argentina,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, South Africa, Timor-Leste and Ukraine
Recent developments include universal schemes for
persons with disabilities in Nepal and South Africa.
Other countries have made notable progress in the
area of non-contributory disability cash benefits, either mainstreaming disability in broader schemes
(Ethiopia, Ghana) or creating specific schemes
for persons with disabilities (Argentina, Indonesia,
Kyrgyzstan, South Africa) (see Abu Alghaib, forthcoming).
• Argentina has dramatically increased the effective
coverage of disability pensions between 1999
and 2016, quintupling the number of recipients to
1.5 million. The expansion of social spending is estimated to have been between 0.03 and 0.35 per
cent of GDP between 1997 and 2010 (Grosh,
Bussolo and Freije, 2014).
• In 2015 Ethiopia scaled up its Productive Safety
Net Programme (PSNP), expected to reach 5 million beneficiaries. PSNP has two components:
public works for households with labour capacity
(4.1 million), and social assistance for those with
members incapable of work (1.1 million) (World
Bank, 2014). As disability is one of eligibility criteria for the latter component, many households
with persons with disabilities should benefit.
• Ghana’s Livelihood Employment against Poverty
Programme (LEAP) includes disability status as
one of the criteria in the proxy means test. LEAP
partially benefits households that have persons
with severe disabilities who are unable to work.
It covered about 8,000 (11 per cent) of the total
number of beneficiary households as of June 2014
(Ghana Ministry of Gender, Children and Social
Protection, 2014; ILO, 2015).
• Indonesia has a disability-specific scheme, providing social assistance for persons with severe
disability (ASODKB). The progress of coverage extension is relatively slow, largely due to financial constraints. The number of beneficiaries rose slightly,
from 20,000 to 23,000, between 2011 and 2015
(Adioetomo, Mont and Irwanto, 2014; JICA, 2015).

a more transformative approach would be necessary
that supports persons with disabilities in accessing productive employment and enables them to earn a livelihood independently in the community. Considering
persons with disabilities as capable economic players,
an enabling approach would recognize their capacities
and contribute to removing barriers to their accessing
the labour market (box 3.19).41
41

• Kyrgyzstan has been making rapid progress in the
extension of its universal (categorical) disability
benefit programme (Monthly Social Benefit, MSB)
to 58,000 beneficiaries out of 167,000 persons
with disabilities (ESCAP, 2016; Kyrgyz Republic
Ministry of Social Development, 2014). Persons
with disabilities receive different benefit packages
depending on their age.
• Nepal’s universal disability allowance for persons
with severe disabilities, introduced in 1996 together with universal allowances for older persons
and widows, is managed by the Ministry of Local
Development. Persons with severe disabilities receive NPR 1,000 per month, while partially disabled beneficiaries receive NPR 300 per month
(Global Partnership for Universal Social Protection,
2016d).
• South Africa has greatly advanced on universal
coverage for persons with disabilities through a
combination of means-tested disability benefits:
Care Dependency Grants (CDG) for 145,000 children with severe disabilities, Disability Grants (DG)
for 1.1 million working-age adults with disabilities
who are unable to work, and Grants-in-Aid (GIA)
providing additional benefits for 166,000 individuals who require higher protection among the
recipients of CDGs and DGs as of March 2017
(Global Partnership for Universal Social Protection,
2016e; SASSA, 2017).
• Timor-Leste’s universal old-age and disability
pension provides the equivalent of US$30 per
month for adults living with disabilities, reaching
7,313 persons with disabilities (Global Partnership
for Universal Social Protection, 2016f).
• Ukraine has a mandatory social security system
that provides old-age, disability and survivors’ pensions to all eligible citizens, with a combination
of contributory benefits for those meeting the
minimum qualifying period and social assistance
for others (Global Partnership for Universal Social
Protection, 2016g).

Second, social protection systems can support a shift
from institutionalization to independently living in
the community. Far too often, persons with disabilities have been institutionalized in care facilities. Based
on an enabling approach, social protection can support
independent living in the community by providing at
least basic income security, effective access to health
care and additional benefits to cover disability‑related

Disability benefits can contribute to promoting economic empowerment by providing benefits to cover disability‑specific costs, such
as the costs of assistive devices, personal assistance or additional transport costs. Such coverage of disability-related costs can facilitate
participation in employment.

Box 3.19  Social protection and its contribution to a virtuous cycle towards decent work

72

By improving access to education for those with
disabilities, social protection can contribute to creating a virtuous cycle leading to increased access to
productive employment in the future.
Education is particularly important to persons with
disabilities when it comes to access to decent work.
Recent studies indicate an association between education and employability, disability and education,
and disability and unemployment in low- and middleincome countries (Banks and Polack, 2014). A study
for Viet Nam found that employment rates for men
and women with disabilities were respectively 53 and
43 per cent lower than those for persons without
disabilities (Mizunoya, Mitra and Yamasaki, 2016). A
similar trend holds in regional surveys for Asia and
the Pacific, and for the Arab States: employment
rates of persons with disabilities were likely to be
lower than the national average (ESCAP, 2016;
ESCWA and League of Arab States, 2014). In Nepal,
persons with disabilities had significantly fewer
years of schooling, but wage returns on investment
in their education were found to be higher than for
their counterparts without disabilities (Lamichhane
and Sawada, 2013). The combination of limited education with low employability on one hand, and high
returns to education on the other, may help States
to take the rational decision of investing in improving
access to education for persons with disabilities. The
evidence from these studies implies that inclusive
education leads to increased earning capacity of
persons with disabilities, and eventually increased
national earning capacity. High labour productivity
of persons with disabilities would cost less in social
spending and medical expenditures, and enhance
work opportunities for caregivers.
Children with disabilities of ten face barriers
in access to basic education. A global study on
the impact of disability on school attendance in

costs. This will also contribute to facilitating participation in education and skills development, and promoting their full and effective participation, choice and
control in the labour market.
Third, social protection systems can also contribute to a better recognition of disability-related costs
by taking them into consideration when designing
social protection programmes (box 3.20). Recent studies point to the inadequacy of benefit levels that barely
fulfil a minimum level of living and are not sufficient
to allow persons with disabilities to accumulate social
and human capital for economic independence in
low- and middle-income countries (Banks et al., 2017;

15 developing countries found that the average gap
in attendance was 30 per cent in both primary and
secondary schools; 85 per cent of primary-age children with disabilities who were out of school had
never attended school; and general education policies had not improved access for children with disabilities, even though countries had nearly achieved
universal primary education (Mizunoya, Mitra and
Yamasaki, 2016). Similarly, another empirical study
in Uganda reaffirms the argument that a universal
primary education policy, waiving tuition fees, would
not be sufficient to improve school attendance of
children with disabilities, and points out the need
for disability-specific schemes to provide children
with disabilities with social protection benefits
that encourage families to send them to school
(Lamichhane and Tsujimoto, 2017).
Investing in inclusive social protection systems
for persons with disabilities is eventually good for
economic growth. Excluding them from the labour
market and society is not only a matter of human
rights but also a significant loss of economic drivers.
Persons with disabilities account for 15 per cent of
the world’s population, of which 785 million persons with disabilities are of working age (15 years
or over) (WHO and World Bank, 2011). The potential economic loss of excluding these populations is
estimated at 3–7 per cent of GDP (Buckup, 2009).
An investment in social protection systems to support those with disabilities in accessing productive
employment can therefore contribute to a great
advance in economic growth. In other words, the
potential impact of their empowerment and participation cannot be overestimated, once the economic
and social barriers to accessing the education
system and productive labour market are removed
through appropriate measures in social protection
and other policy areas.

Kuper et al., 2016; Palmer, 2013), and stress the importance of reflecting this in the design of schemes and
programmes. Few countries, however, have rigorous
estimates that could help policy-makers assess the adequacy of disability benefits.42 In addition, a qualitative
study conducted in Viet Nam poses a methodological
question for the estimation of disability costs (Palmer
et al., 2015). One-size-fits-all eligibility criteria for
proxy means tests, and uniform benefit levels which do
not take into account disability-related costs, indeed
put persons with disabilities at a disadvantage (Kidd
et al., forthcoming). The design of disability benefit
programmes should consider disability-related costs,

42
A systematic review of existing literatures indicates that there is too little rigorous quantitative data to develop globally comparative
evidence on the extra costs of living with a disability (Mitra et al., 2017).

3. Social protection for women and men of working age

Box 3.20  Underestimated poverty and additional costs of living with disabilities
There is increasing recognition that monetar y
poverty for persons with disabilities is largely underestimated because the commonly accepted poverty
measurement based on household income or consumption does not always take disability-related
costs into account.
In Cambodia, an empirical study estimated that,
on average, persons with disabilities incur an additional cost of US$40 per month, which is equivalent to 17.1 per cent of household income (see
figure 3.28). If these costs are taken into account,
the poverty rate would nearly double to 34.3 per cent
for households including persons with disabilities
(Palmer, Williams and McPake, 2016). In Viet Nam,
disability-related costs were estimated at 11.5 per

cent of household income, and would increase the
poverty rate by 4.7 percentage points (Mont and
Cuong, 2011); another estimate for the same country
was 9 per cent and would raise the poverty rate by
3.7 percentage points (Braithwaite and Mont, 2009).
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, disability-related costs
were estimated at 14 per cent, which would raise the
poverty rate by 9.7 percentage points (ibid.).
These considerations have important implications for social protection policy. If disability-related
costs are not taken into account, poverty-targeted
and other programmes potentially underestimate
the needs of persons with disabilities and provide
an inadequate level of benefits for poor households
having disabled members.

for example through adopting the twin-track approach providing general benefits through mainstream
schemes and additional support through disabilityspecific schemes.
In addition, the collection of disaggregated administrative data by disability status43 is a critical issue for
the implementation of the SDGs as well as the development of evidence-based policies (UN, 2016b; UNDP
et al., 2016). Although some countries have disaggregated data collected through household surveys, they
rarely have administrative data that would allow them
43

to assess the disability status of social protection beneficiaries.44 This is especially important for the progress
monitoring of SDG indicator 1.3.1: extending social
protection to persons with disabilities. The collection of
disaggregated administrative data should be conducted
in an internationally comparable manner and on a frequent and regular basis.

Such disaggregated data would allow States to monitor SDG indicators by type and severity of disabilities.
Even though States may not have administrative data, they could still improve household surveys by integrating a set of disability-related
questions into their questionnaires, such as The Washington Group Short Set of Disability Questions (Washington Group, 2016). This
would allow them to collect some disaggregated data that would be useful in the development of inclusive policies.

Fighting poverty
through pension systems

KEY MESSAGES
nn
Pensions for older women and men are the most widespread form of social protection in
the world, and a key element in SDG 1.3. At the global level, 68 per cent of people above
retirement age receive a pension, either contributory or non-contributory.
nn
Significant progress has been made in extending pension system coverage in developing
countries. Universal pensions have been developed in Argentina, Belarus, the Plurinational
State of Bolivia, Botswana, Cabo Verde, China, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Maldives,
Mauritius, Mongolia, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Timor-Leste, Trinidad
and Tobago, Ukraine, Uruguay, Uzbekistan and Zanzibar (United Republic of Tanzania).
Other developing countries, such as Azerbaijan, Armenia, Brazil, Chile, Kazakhstan and
Thailand, are near universality.
nn
However, the right to social protection of older persons is not yet a reality for many. In most
low-income countries, less than 20 per cent of older persons over statutory retirement age
receive a pension. In many developing countries, a large proportion of older persons still
depend heavily on family support arrangements.
nn
Observed trends vary substantially across regions and even between countries within the
same region. In countries with comprehensive and mature systems of social protection, with
ageing populations, the main challenge is to maintain a good balance between financial sustainability and pension adequacy. At the other extreme, many countries around the world are
still struggling to extend and finance their pension systems; these countries face structural
barriers linked to development, high levels of informality, low contributory capacity, poverty
and insufficient fiscal space, among others.
nn
A noticeable trend in developing countries is the proliferation of non-contributory pensions,
including universal social pensions. This is very positive, particularly in countries with high
levels of informality, facing difficulties in extending contributory schemes. Trends show that
many countries are succeeding in introducing a universal floor of income security for older
persons.
nn
Public schemes, based on solidarity and collective financing, are by far the most widespread
form of old-age protection globally. Pension privatization policies, implemented in the past
in a number of countries, did not deliver the expected results, as coverage and benefits did
not increase, systemic risks were transferred to individuals and fiscal positions worsened. As
a result, a number of countries are reversing privatization measures and returning to public
solidarity-based systems.
nn
Recent austerity or fiscal consolidation trends are affecting the adequacy of pension systems
and general conditions of retirement. In several countries, these reforms are putting at risk
the fulfilment of the minimum standards in social security, and eroding the social contract.
Countries should be cautious when designing reforms to ensure that pension systems fulfil
their mission of providing economic security to older persons.

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

4.1 SDGs and income security
in old age

76

Ensuring income security for people during their old
age is a crucial objective among the welfare goals that
modern societies seek to realize (see box 4.1). Throughout their working life, when most people enjoy good
health and productive capacity, they contribute to national development and progress, so it would seem fair
that once they get older they are not left behind and
that prosperity is shared with them.
In order to meet this objective, which is closely
linked to the human right to social security, reliable
mechanisms that ensure systematic protection against
risks of vulnerability of older persons are required.
While some population groups can access protection
mechanisms through individual efforts, such as personal savings or house ownership, or even if others can
take advantage of intra-generational family support
mechanisms, the reality faced by the majority of the
world’s population, especially in the developing world,
is that sources of income are unreliable even during
working age. In particular, as the direct consequence
of informality, which is linked to the structural problems of economic development in many countries,
only a small fraction of the world population has the
capacity to fend for itself during old age. Hence the
crucial role played by social protection systems for
older persons.
For these reasons, public pension systems have
become a foundation on which income security for
older persons has been built. Income security in old
age also depends on the availability of, access to, and
cost of other social services including health care, housing and long-term care. In addition to the public social
services, in-kind benefits may also include housing
and energy subsidies, home help and care services, and
residential care. If affordable access to such services is
not provided, older persons and their families can be
pushed into extreme poverty, even in developed countries. In countries with wider access to quality public
services, poverty among older persons is also significantly lower.
The 2030 Agenda, in particular SDG target 1.3, calls
for the implementation of national social protection
systems for all, including floors, with special attention
to the poor and the vulnerable. In order to guarantee
that no older person is left behind, policy- and decisionmakers should take into consideration the construction
of comprehensive social protection systems based on the
principle of universality. Recommendation No. 202,

adopted unanimously by ILO constituents in 2012,
calls for combining contributory public pensions with
non-contributory pension schemes in order to protect
the whole population. While SDG 1.3 calls explicitly
for the implementation of nationally appropriate social
protection systems and measures for all, including floors
that provide income security in old age, it has to be
noted that social protection – and income security in
old age in particular – contributes to a variety of other
goals and addresses issues beyond SDG 1. Income security in old age also contributes significantly to SDG 5
(supporting gender equality and the empowerment of
women) and SDG 10 (helping to reduce inequality
within and among countries). Furthermore, income
security in old age contributes indirectly to many other
SDGs, for instance to SDG 11, where income security
in old age can be instrumental in supporting families
and individuals in accessing adequate, safe and affordable housing. Income security in old age therefore plays
a key role in achieving the goals set by the global community under the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals and contributes to, among others,
the fundamental commitment to end poverty in all its
forms and dimensions, including eradicating extreme
poverty by 2030, ensuring that all people enjoy a decent
standard of living.

4.2 Types of pension schemes
Throughout the history of social security, public pension schemes have proved to be an effective instrument
in ensuring income security of older persons as well as
in combating poverty and social inequality.
According to international experience, pension systems can be organized in many different ways. The objective of classifying pension schemes is to categorize
the underlying operative principles of such schemes, as
well as to enable general comparisons of their impact in
fulfilling the social security objectives. From the ILO
perspective, all pension schemes that contribute towards old-age income security are relevant. Their degree
of relevance is however gauged by their compliance with
ILO standards on social security.
The vast majority of countries (186 out of 192 countries for which information is available) provide pensions in the form of a periodic cash benefit through
at least one scheme and often through a combination
of different types of contributory and non-contributory schemes (see figure 4.1). The remaining six countries do not offer periodic benefits; some provide

4. Social protection for older women and men

Box 4.1 International standards on old-age pensions
The rights of older persons to social security and
to an adequate standard of living to support their
health and well-being, including medical care and
necessary social services, are laid down in the major
international human rights instruments, the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 1948, and
(in more general terms) the International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR),
1966.1 The content of these rights is further specified
in the normative body of standards developed by the
ILO, which provide concrete guidance to countries
for giving effect to the right of older persons to social
security, from basic levels to full realization.2
The Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), the Old-Age, Invalidity and
Survivors’ Benefits Convention, 1967 (No. 128), and
its accompanying Recommendation No. 131, and
the Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012
(No. 202), provide an international reference framework setting out the range and levels of social security benefits that are necessary and adequate for
ensuring income maintenance and income security,
as well as access to health care, in old age. The
extension of coverage to all older persons is an underlying objective of these standards, with the aim
of achieving universality of protection, as explicitly
stated in Recommendation No. 202.
Conventions Nos 102 and 128 and Recommendation No. 131 make provision for the payment of
pensions in old age, at guaranteed levels, upon
completion of a qualifying period, and their regular
adjustment to maintain pensioners’ purchasing
power. More particularly, Conventions Nos 102 and
128 envisage the provision of income security to
people who have reached pensionable age through
earnings-related contributory pensions (guaranteeing minimum benefit levels, or replacement rates
corresponding to a prescribed proportion of an
individual’s past earnings – in particular for those
with lower earnings) and/or by flat-rate non-contributory pensions which can be either universal or
means‑tested. The guaranteed minimum levels for
1

UDHR, Arts 22 and 25(1); ICESCR, Art. 9.

2

the latter should be a prescribed proportion of the
average earnings of a typical unskilled worker, but
the “total of the benefit and other available means
… shall be sufficient to maintain the family of the
beneficiary in health and decency” (Convention
No. 102, Art. 67(a)).
Recommendation No. 202 completes this framework by calling for the guarantee of basic income
security to all persons in old age, prioritizing those
in need and those not covered by existing arrangements. Such a guarantee would act as a safeguard
against poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion
in old age for people not covered by contributory
pension schemes. It is also of high relevance to pensioners whose benefits are affected by the financial
losses suffered by pension funds, whose pensions
are not regularly adjusted to changes in the costs
of living, or whose pensions are simply inadequate
to secure effective access to necessary goods and
services and allow life in dignity. ILO social security
standards thus provide a comprehensive set of references and a framework for the establishment,
development and maintenance of old-age pension
systems at national level.
An important social policy challenge facing ageing
societies is to secure an adequate level of income
for all people in old age without overstretching the
capacities of younger generations. In view of the
financing and sustainability challenge faced by social security systems in the context of demographic
change, the State has a vital role to play in forecasting the long-term balance between resources
and expenditure in order to guarantee that institutions will meet their obligations towards older persons. The principle in ILO social security standards,
strongly reaffirmed recently by Recommendation
No. 202, of the overall and primary responsibility
of the State in this respect will undoubtedly play an
important role in how future governments are held
accountable for the sustainability of national social
security systems in view of, among other factors,
demographic change.

See CESCR, 2008.

lump-sum benefits through provident funds or similar
programmes.
In 72 countries (39 per cent of the total number of
countries with available information) there are only
contributory schemes; the vast majority of them operate under a social insurance scheme, mainly covering
employees and self-employed workers.
Among the countries considered, in 12 cases pensions are provided exclusively through non‑contributory schemes. Of these, the majority provide universal
coverage.

The combination of contributory and non-contributory schemes is the most predominant form of organization of pension systems in the world: 102 countries
feature both contributory and non‑contributory pension schemes. The non-contributory schemes in these
countries vary: 14 countries provide universal benefits to all older persons above a certain age threshold;
24 countries provide pensions-tested benefits to older
persons who do not receive any other pension; and
64 countries provide means-tested benefits to older persons below a certain income threshold.

4.3 Legal coverage
While a global trend towards increasing both legal and
effective coverage of pension systems is observed, for
most of the world’s population the right to income
security in old age is unfulfilled, and considerable
inequalities persist. Globally, 67.6 per cent of the
working-age population are covered by existing laws
under mandatory contributory and non-contributory
schemes,1 and would therefore potentially be eligible
for an old-age pension on reaching the prescribed age
if these laws were properly implemented and enforced
(see figure 4.2). In addition to mandatory contributory and non-contributory schemes, 17.7 per cent of the
working-age population have the possibility to contribute voluntarily, yet in many cases few people make use
of this option.
Legal coverage for women is somewhat lower than
that for the entire population, at 64.1 per cent, which
largely reflects their lower labour market participation
rates and their over-representation among those working as self-employed or unpaid family workers, particularly in agriculture, as domestic workers or in other

occupations or sectors frequently not covered by existing legislation. For example, in the Arab States, legal
coverage of women is only 34.8 per cent, while total
population coverage is at 45.9 per cent. Similar trends
can be observed for sub-Saharan and Northern Africa,
where women’s legal coverage is lower in comparison
to total population. In these regions, women whose
husbands were covered by contributory schemes are in
many countries entitled to survivors’ pensions which
often become their only source of income.

4.4 Effective coverage: Monitoring SDG
indicator 1.3.1 for older persons
While legal coverage refers to the extent to which existing legal frameworks offer legal entitlements, effective
coverage refers to the effective implementation of
the legal framework. The beneficiary coverage ratio
presented in figure 4.3 shows the percentage of older
persons above statutory pensionable age receiving contributory or non-contributory pensions. This serves for
monitoring the SDG indicator 1.3.1.

1
The extent of legal coverage for old age is defined as the proportion of the working-age population (or alternatively the labour force)
covered by law with schemes providing periodic cash benefits once statutory pensionable age or other eligible age is reached. The population
covered is estimated by using the available demographic, employment and other statistics to quantify the size of the groups covered as
specified in the national legislation. Actual, effective coverage is often significantly lower than legal coverage where laws are not implemented
fully or enforced. For additional details, see the glossary in Annex I, as well as Annex II.

Worldwide, 68 per cent of people above retirement
age receive a pension, either contributory or non-contributory. 2 Consequently, compared with other social
protection functions, income protection of older persons is the most widespread form of social protection,
showing significant development over the last few years.
Regional differences in income protection for older
persons are very significant: coverage rates in higherincome countries are close to 100 per cent, while in
sub-Saharan Africa they are only 22.7 per cent, and in
Southern Asia 23.6 per cent.3
Figure 4.4 presents two additional indicators to
understand the extent to which the existing statutory
frameworks are implemented. Focusing on contributory pensions, the “contributor coverage ratio” in its
two variants provides some indication of future pension
coverage: it shows the percentages of, respectively, those
who are economically active (“contributors/labour force
coverage ratio”) and those of working age (“contributors/population coverage ratio”) who contribute to existing contributory pension schemes.

Weighted by population of pensionable age.
As the available data for many countries do not allow for a
detailed age breakdown of old-age pensioners, the indicator
is calculated as the total number of beneficiaries of old-age
pensions as a proportion of the population above statutory
pensionable age.

The contributor coverage ratio gives an indication of
the proportion of the working-age population – or the
labour force – which will have access to contributory
pensions in the future based on current contributory
effort. Although this measure does not reflect non-contributory pensions, it still provides an important signal
regarding future coverage levels, taking into account
that benefit levels in contributory pension schemes are
normally higher than those from non-contributory
schemes. At the global level, roughly a quarter of the
working-age population (24.9 per cent) contribute to a
pension scheme, with large regional variations ranging
from 6.3 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa to 76.2 per
cent in Northern America.

Looking at the contributor coverage ratio as a percentage of the labour force, 34.5 per cent of the global
labour force contribute to a pension insurance scheme,
and can therefore expect to receive a contributory pension upon retirement. Owing to the high proportion
of informal employment in sub‑Saharan Africa, only
9.0 per cent of the labour force contribute to pension insurance and accumulate rights to a contributory pension. In South-Eastern Asia, about one-fifth
of the labour force (20.4 per cent) contribute, while in
Southern Asia coverage is only 13.7 per cent; contributor coverage ratios are slightly higher in the Arab States
(31.4 per cent), Eastern Asia (34.1 per cent), Northern
Africa (38.2 per cent), Latin America and the Caribbean
(40.4 per cent), Central and Western Asia (57.1 per cent)
and Eastern Europe (68.3 per cent). Northern, Southern and Western Europe and Northern America reach
coverage rates of 86.7 and 97.0 per cent respectively, followed by Europe and Central Asia and Oceania with
75.6 and 69.9 per cent of the labour force respectively.
In lower-income countries, usually only a very small
proportion of those employed are wage and salary earners with formal employment contracts, and are thus
relatively easily covered by contributory pensions. Informality, contribution evasion and fragile governance
(including lack of institutional capacity to ensure enforcement of laws) are also more prevalent in lowerincome countries. That is why effective coverage seems
to be strongly associated with a country’s income level,
although it is in fact labour market structures, law enforcement and governance that actually exert the critical influence.
With efforts to extend contributory schemes to all
with some contributory capacity, and with the introduction of non-contributory pensions in a larger number of
countries, coverage has been extended significantly to
workers in informal employment, providing at least a
minimum of income security in old age. The following
section will address these trends in more detail.

4.5 Trends in pension coverage across
the world: Achieving universal social
protection for all older persons
While there is still room for improvement, a significant number of countries across the world have achieved
substantial progress in terms of effective pension coverage in recent years. Whereas in 2000 only 34 countries reached high effective coverage of more than 90 per
cent of the population above statutory pensionable

4. Social protection for older women and men

Box 4.2 Universal social pensions in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Botswana,
Lesotho, Namibia, Timor‑Leste and Zanzibar (United Republic of Tanzania)
The experiences of the Plurinational State of Bolivia,
Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Zanzibar (United
Republic of Tanzania) show that universal, non-contributory social pensions for older persons are feasible and
can be financed by governments of low- and middleincome countries.
Plurinational State of Bolivia: Despite having the lowest
GDP per capita on the South American continent, the
Plurinational State of Bolivia has one of the highest coverage rates in old-age pensions. With the introduction
of the non-contributory old‑age pension called Renta
Dignidad in 2007, it achieved universal coverage. Renta
Dignidad reaches around 91 per cent of the population
over the age of 60, providing benefit levels at around
US$36 per beneficiary without a contributory pension and around US$29 for recipients of contributory
schemes. The programme costs around 1 per cent of
GDP and is financed from a direct tax on hydrocarbons
and dividends from state-owned companies. It has led
to a 14 per cent poverty reduction at the household
level and has secured beneficiary incomes and consumption. In households receiving the benefit, child
labour has dropped by half and school enrolment has
reached close to 100 per cent.
Botswana: The universal old-age pension is estimated
to reach all citizens above 65 years of age. The pension is a monthly cash transfer of US$30, which is just
over a third of the food poverty line. This is modest
and sustainable. The pension and other social protection programmes, complemented by drought response
and recovery measures, have contributed substantially
to overall poverty reduction, with extreme poverty in
Botswana falling from 23.4 per cent in 2003 to 6.4 per
cent in 2009–10.
Lesotho: With more than 4 per cent of its population
above the age of 70, Lesotho has a larger share of older
people than many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. All
citizens over 70 years of age are entitled to a monthly
old-age pension (OAP) of LSL 550, equivalent to US$40.
It is the largest regular cash transfer in Lesotho, covering about 83,000 persons. While coverage of eligible
persons is approximately 100 per cent, it is estimated
that many more benefit indirectly. The OAP costs about

1.7 per cent of GDP and is financed by general taxation,
which largely comes from revenues of the Southern
African Customs Union. Complementary services and
transfers provided as part of the national social protection system include subsidized or free primary health
care at government health centres and government hospitals, free antiretroviral treatment medication for HIV/
AIDS patients, and a cash grant administered by local
governments for those deemed “needy”.
Namibia: The Basic Social Grant in Namibia guarantees all residents over 60 years of age a monthly allowance of NAD 1,100 (approximately US$78), lifting the
beneficiary well above the poverty line. Beneficiaries
have been found to share the grant with the extended
family, especially by supporting the schooling and wellbeing of grandchildren. While there are some problems
in reaching people in remote areas, the total coverage is
estimated to be over 90 per cent.
Timor-Leste: The old-age and disability pension is a
universal non-contributory scheme for all Timorese
people above 60 years of age and those living with
disabilities. It reaches 86,974 older people and provides
US$30 per month, which is slightly above the national
poverty line. A 2011 simulation estimated that the pension had reduced national poverty from 54 to 49 per
cent, and poverty among older persons from 55.1 to
37.6 per cent. With the creation of the Contributory
Social Security Scheme in future, it is estimated that
some of the current beneficiaries will move to the
contributory system and thus reduce pressure on the
budget for the non-contributory scheme.
Zanzibar: In April 2016, Zanzibar (United Republic of
Tanzania) became the first territory in East Africa to implement a social pension financed fully by the Government.
The Universal Pension Scheme provides all residents
over the age of 70 a monthly pension of TZS 20,000
(US$9). In a place with high poverty and high work informality, very few people are eligible for the contributory
pension. The benefit level is admittedly modest and
cannot lift older people out of poverty on its own, but it
is a reasonable first step towards expanding a universal
pension. In May 2016, 21,750 people, or 86 per cent of
the eligible population, received the universal pension.

age, 53 countries fall into this category in 2015–17.
In addition, the number of countries where pension provision reaches less than 20 per cent of older persons fell
to 51, according to the most recent data available, compared to 73 countries in 2000. Overall, the data indicate
positive trends, both in legal and effective coverage.
Many countries experienced a marked increase
in coverage between 2000 and 2015–17, and a large
number of developing countries achieved universal coverage for all older persons. Universal pensions have been
instituted in Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan,

Belarus, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Botswana,
Brazil, Cabo Verde, Chile, China, Cook Islands, Georgia, Guyana, Kazakhstan, Kiribati, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan,
Lesotho, Maldives, Mauritius, Mongolia, Namibia,
Nepal, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Thailand,
Timor-Leste, Trinidad and Tobago, Ukraine, Uruguay,
Uzbekistan and Zanzibar (United Republic of Tanzania). Experience shows that universal coverage may be
achieved by either creating tax-funded non‑contributory
social pensions for all (see box 4.2), or by a mix of contributory and non‑contributory schemes (see box 4.3).

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Box 4.3 Universal social protection for older persons through a mix of contributory
and non-contributory schemes: Argentina, Brazil, Cabo Verde, China, Kyrgyzstan,
Maldives, South Africa, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago
In recent decades, many countries have made significant efforts to expand the coverage of contributory
pension schemes and establish non-contributory social
pensions to guarantee basic income security for all older
persons. The experiences described here show that extending pension coverage to citizens over a relatively
short period is possible.
Argentina: Coverage rates in Argentina rose from 69 to
close to 100 per cent of older persons between 2003
and 2015. The extension was made possible partly
through a temporary flexibilization measure (the pension
moratorium), under which older adults who do not have
the 30 years of contributions required to receive benefits
were made eligible for a pension if they joined a plan to
pay the contribution years they had missed retroactively,
under very favourable conditions.

82

Brazil: The old-age pension system integrates contributor y, semi-contributor y and non-contributor y
schemes which cover both public and private sector
workers as well as smallholder farmers and rural workers.
The non-contributory social assistance grants are meanstested benefits for people aged 65 or over and persons
with disabilities. The system has nearly universal coverage, as 80.2 per cent of those aged 65 and over received a pension in 2014. Benefit levels are earnings-related for the contributory schemes. They are equal to the
minimum wage for smallholder farmers and rural workers
and those receiving the social assistance pension.
Cabo Verde: With social protection high on its development agenda, Cabo Verde took two major steps towards
a universal pension system by creating the National
Centre of Social Pensions (CNPS) in 2006 and unifying
pre-existing non-contributory pension programmes. This
unified scheme guarantees basic income security for
persons over 60 years old and persons with disabilities
including children with disabilities living in poor families.
Social pensions have helped reduce poverty, adding
a key pillar to Cabo Verde’s strategy of establishing a
more comprehensive social protection floor. Today social
pensions, in combination with the contributory scheme,
cover about 85.8 per cent of the population above pensionable age, and provide benefits at around US$65
(20 per cent higher than the poverty line). Pensioners

As indicated in figures 4.5 and 4.6, a number
of countries have also been successful in expanding effective coverage: Bangladesh, Belarus, Belize,
Ecuador, Republic of Korea, India, Philippines and
Viet Nam, among others. In many countries the extension of coverage was made possible mainly through
the establishment or extension of non-contributory
pension schemes which provide at least a basic level of
protection for many older persons, while others have
combined the expansion of contributory schemes to

also benefit from the Mutual Health Fund, which subsidizes the purchase of medicines from private pharmacies and provides a funeral allowance. The social
pensions cost nearly 0.4 per cent of GDP and are fully
financed from the general state budget, whereas the
Mutual Health Fund is financed from beneficiaries’
monthly contributions of 2 per cent of the social pension’s current value.
China: Before 2009, only two institutional mechanisms
for income security in old age existed in China: one for
urban workers based on social insurance principles, and
one for civil servants and others of similar status based on
the employer liability approach. Together they covered in
2008 under 250 million people (including pensioners), or
about 23 per cent of the population aged 15 and above.
Following a series of reforms in 2009, 2011, 2014 and
2015, an old-age pension scheme was established for
the rural and urban populations not participating in the
social insurance scheme, while the civil servants’ scheme
was merged with the social insurance scheme for urban
workers. In 2015, 850 million people were covered under
the pension system; by 2017, universal coverage had
been achieved.
Kyrgyzstan: The contributory retirement, disability and
survivors’ pension is the largest social protection scheme
in Kyrgyzstan. It covers workers in the public and private sectors as well as informal economy and agricultural
workers. In addition, a non-contributory Monthly Social
Benefit covers other older people, with a benefit amount
fixed at KGS 1,000 since 2011. More than 90 per cent
of the population over the age of 65 receives a pension,
which has a major impact on reducing poverty in old age.
Maldives: Coverage was successfully extended through
a series of reforms between 2009 and 2014, establishing a two-pillar system including the non-contributory
Old Age Basic Pension and the contributory Maldives
Retirement Pension Scheme. The system covers public
sector employees and has extended coverage to the private sector (2011) and to expatriates (2014). The Senior
Citizen Allowance provides a further pension top-up to
address poverty and inequality. Pension coverage has
gradually increased since the reforms and in 2017 is
close to 100 per cent.

previously uncovered groups of the population with
other measures.
Figure 4.6 indicates that despite significant efforts
to extend coverage around the world, not all countries have fared well, in contrast to the success stories
presented above. Albania, Azerbaijan and Greece, for
instance, countries that had previously achieved coverage rates close to 90 per cent or higher in 2000, have
since suffered a significant decrease, with coverage rates
dropping by 12–16 percentage points.

4. Social protection for older women and men

Box 4.3 (cont’d)
South Africa: South Africa was the first African country
to introduce a social pension for older persons to extend coverage for those who did not have social insurance. The Older Person’s Grant (is an income-tested,
monthly payment of ZAR 1,500 (US$112) for persons
aged 60–75 years and ZAR 1,520 (US$114) for those
above 75 years. It is paid to around three million older
persons in South Africa, reaching up to 100 per cent
coverage in some jurisdictions. The Older Person’s Grant
is given to citizens, permanent residents and refugees
with legal status, and is estimated to have significantly
helped reduce inequality, with a Gini coefficient of 0.77
(without grants) and 0.60 (with grants).
Thailand: The pension system comprises several contributory schemes for public-sector officials, privatesector employees and informal-economy workers,
reaching about a quarter of the population above
60 years of age. Additionally, a non-contributory old-age
allowance provides some protection to people without

access to regular pension payments. The monthly benefit
is tiered and varies between THB 600–1,000, equivalent to US$18–30, which is less than half the poverty
line. The universal old-age allowance serves as the only
form of pension for many people working in the informal
economy. To encourage participation in the contributory
system, the Government provides a matching contribution
under the voluntary social insurance scheme.
Trinidad and Tobago: A contributory retirement pension
administered by the National Insurance Board and a
non-contributory Senior Citizens’ Pension (SCP) provide
income security for older people in the country. The SCP
is a monthly grant of up to TTD 3,500 (US$520) paid
to residents aged 65 or more. This is higher than the
established poverty line. The SCP cost 1.6 per cent of
GDP in 2015. With 90,800 citizens receiving the SCP in
September 2016, it is estimated that the combination of
the contributory retirement pension and the SCP reach
universal coverage of older persons in the country.

4.6 Expenditure on social protection
for older persons
The level of expenditure on the income security of older
persons is a useful measure for understanding the development level of pension systems. National public pension expenditure levels are influenced by a complexity
of factors, comprising demographic structure, effective
coverage, adequacy of benefits, relative size to GDP, and
the variations in the policy mix between public and private provision for pensions and social services. Public
social security expenditure on pensions and other nonhealth benefits earmarked for older persons amounts on
average to 6.9 per cent of GDP globally (see figure 4.7).4
Public non-health social protection expenditure for
older persons takes the highest proportion of GDP in
Northern, Southern and Western Europe, at 10.7 per
cent. It is worth noting that this region has the highest
ratio of older persons, comprising 19.6 per cent of the
total population. Central and Western Asia as well as
Latin America and the Caribbean have relatively high
average expenditure ratios at 6.8 and 6.0 per cent respectively, whilst their population ratios of older persons are relatively low at 7.7 per cent and 7.5 per cent
4

respectively. Interestingly, Northern America has the
same average GDP expenditure rate as Central and
Western Asia at 6.8 per cent, while the ratio of its older
population is nearly double that of Central and Western Asia. The Arab States and sub-Saharan Africa, on
the other hand, have similar older population ratios,
whereas the expenditure rate for the Arab States is
twice that of sub-Saharan Africa, probably reflecting
the lower levels of effective coverage in the latter region.
South-Eastern Asia has a GDP expense ratio similar to
that of sub-Saharan Africa, although its older population ratio is nearly twice as high.
Figure 4.8 provides a country-by-country review
of the share of GDP allocated to the income security
needs of older persons. For more effective comparisons,
the countries are grouped by income status, namely
high, low and middle income. As expected, the general
trend is that higher-income countries are allocating a
higher ratio of their GDP to the income security needs
of older persons. The expected higher population ratio
of older persons in developed countries, and achievements in terms of adequacy and effective coverage (the
proportion of older persons receiving pension benefits)
are key contributors to the observed trend. Countries

While the data include not only pensions but, so far as possible, other cash and in-kind benefits for older persons, they do not include
expenditure on long-term care, the cost of which in many countries is already significant and is likely to increase further in the future due to
demographic change.

with a strong social welfare background are also expected to exhibit higher social protection expenditure
trends. It is noted that France, Greece and Italy are
the lead countries, with the highest allocations. The
high- and middle-income country groups exhibit a wide
degree of variance in expenditure ratios. This variance
is informed by the contrasting demographic and social
protection system profiles. The low-income country
group exhibits the lowest expenditure ratios, with the
lead country in this group (United Republic of Tanzania) spending only 2 per cent of GDP on the income
security needs of older persons.

4.7 Inequalities and the persistent gender gap
in access to income security in old age
Income security in old age and access to pension benefits are closely associated with the inequalities that
exist in the labour market and in employment. Such
inequalities become evident from examination of a disaggregation of coverage rates by gender, the focus of this
section (see figures 4.9 and 4.10).
It is widely known that women tend to face a higher
risk of poverty than men do, and there are many underlying reasons why this also applies to women in old age.
First, there is the fact that women live longer, resulting
in predominance at the oldest ages of women with poor
levels of support and livelihood (UNFPA and HelpAge
International, 2012; UNRISD, 2010). Not many pension systems succeed in meeting the needs of men and

women equitably: contributory pension coverage of
women tends to be significantly lower than men’s, and
the amounts received by women on average tend to be
lower (Razavi et al., 2012).
A gender-biased design of pension schemes (e.g. lower
pensionable age for women, or the application of sexspecific mortality tables to calculate benefit levels which
result in women receiving lower pensions than men with
the same contribution record and retirement age) can
lead to inequalities; yet in many cases a more significant
driver of gender inequality is found in the discrimination against women in the labour market, coupled with
a pension scheme design which does not compensate
for differences deriving from labour market conditions
and sometimes even magnifies them (Behrendt and
Woodall, 2015). In this context, many women struggle to accrue pension rights that are equal to their male
counterparts. Women’s wage employment, particularly
in formal labour markets, has historically been lower
than men’s and continues to be so in many parts of the
world (ILO, 2012c). Likewise, women systematically
earn less than men (ILO, 2014e), which lowers their
contributions to pension schemes. As women tend to
take on a greater share of family responsibilities, they are
more likely to shorten or interrupt their employment careers and face a higher risk of working in precarious and
informal employment, which also affects their ability to
build up pension entitlements. These factors lead to relatively low pension benefits where these are calculated on
an earnings-related basis, unless effective measures are
put in place to compensate for gender inequalities.

Non-contributory pensions can play a key role in
ensuring women’s access to at least a basic pension, yet
benefit levels are often low, insufficient to fully meet
their needs; nor do they fully compensate for the lack
of contributory coverage. Greater efforts are necessary,
also to ensure increased participation by women in contributory schemes (ILO, 2016a).

It should also be noted that in many parts of the
world women are disproportionately represented among
the rural population, where paid work, even if available, is likely to be relatively poorly paid, informal and
insecure – reflecting, in part at least, the movement of
men to cities in search of better-paid work at the more
formalized end of the labour market spectrum. At the

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

88

same time, the growing importance of non-contributory pensions in the provision of old-age income, especially in low- and lower-middle income countries, is
clearly helping to bridge the coverage gap between men
and women to some extent. For instance, in Thailand,
84.6 per cent of women above retirement age are receiving the non‑contributory pension, but only 77.9 per cent
of men (figure 4.10). Likewise, Azerbaijan provides a
pension for 95 per cent of its female citizens through its
universal social protection system that, among others,
consists of a contribution-based labour pension and
social allowances (transfers).
On the other hand, Costa Rica indicates a relatively
low coverage of its female population, with currently
only 48.8 per cent above statutory pensionable age receiving an old-age pension, as opposed to 65.4 per cent
of the male population. Yet the data in figure 4.9 also
show a relatively high proportion of females (63.8 per
cent) contributing to a pension scheme, compared to
only 36.3 per cent of males. According to these data it
can be assumed that the level of coverage among females
is likely to increase in the future. In Colombia and Ecuador, for example, the data indicate a higher contributory
coverage for females than for males and thus a potential
improvement in coverage in the long run. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, the proportion of older women
receiving the non-contributory Renta Dignidad only (as
opposed to a reduced level of Renta Dignidad in addition to a contributory pension) is significantly higher
than that of men (83.3 per cent versus 66.3 per cent).
More optimistic prospects may nevertheless be seen
in a number of nascent trends that address inequality
in pension coverage. There are efforts everywhere to
expand the effective coverage of contributory schemes
to at least some categories of self-employed and other
workers with contributory capacity. In addition, the
establishment of large-scale non-contributory pension
schemes in many countries has expanded effective coverage and reduced inequalities, both between women
and men, and between rural and urban populations.
Gender equality considerations are gaining some
ground in the public debate on pensions. Proactive policy measures have been implemented in some
countries to reduce the effect of differentiated career
5

patterns on old-age income security. The most obvious
discriminatory elements and parameters of national
pension schemes, such as the differential pension ages
which were common until recently, are rapidly being
eliminated, albeit in the context of general increases in
pension ages for both women and men.
Other steps in the same direction include crediting pension accounts during maternity, paternity and
parental leave, and a better recognition of care work
undertaken by both women and men. Measures to
facilitate a more equal sharing of care responsibilities
between women and men contribute to addressing
some of the inequalities in the labour market and in
social protection more broadly, and may be reflected in
a reduction of gender inequalities in labour markets and
pension systems in the long run.
As with so many other aspects of social protection,
those relating to the promotion of equitable treatment
of women and men must – if they are to be addressed
effectively and in a spirit of social justice – be dealt with
on a basis which fully integrates labour market and
social protection policy-making.

4.8 The adequacy of pensions to provide
genuine income security to older persons
The twin objectives of pension systems are to reach all
older persons in need and to do so at an appropriate
monetary level of benefit provision. While there are sufficient data to assess the extent of coverage (sections 4.3
and 4.4), comparative assessments of the adequacy of
post-retirement benefits are challenging, given that it
is difficult to identify a comparable methodology and
benchmark that can be applied globally (see box 4.4).5
The extent to which retirement pensions are considered sufficient varies from one society to another,
in particular in prevailing attitudes on matters such as
the distribution of responsibility between individuals
and the State, redistribution and the support to be provided to the poor and vulnerable, and intergenerational
solidarity. Other aspects include the age at which retirement takes place, the level of income security that
should be guaranteed and to whom, and the degree of

The OECD, in collaboration with the World Bank, has made some attempts to calculate replacement indicators beyond EU and OECD
countries, specifically regarding replacement rates provided by pension systems in different countries for hypothetical individuals with
different levels of earnings and contributory past service (see Whitehouse, 2012); however, these are not yet included in the World Bank
Pension Database. HelpAge’s Global AgeWatch Index (HelpAge International, 2015) looks at the overall income situation of older people,
not specifically at the levels of protection provided by existing pension systems. Within the AgeWatch Index, income security of older
persons is measured by four indicators: percentage of older persons receiving pensions, relative poverty rates of older persons, relative
income/consumption position of older persons (average incomes of those over 60 as a proportion of average incomes of the rest of the
population), and the GNI per capita.

4. Social protection for older women and men

Box 4.4 Monitoring pension benefit adequacy
Trends move in different directions; in some cases
pension systems improve the benefit level and in
other cases pension benefits are reduced. It is
worth noting that recent fiscal consolidation trends
are having a negative impact on the adequacy of
pension payments in many countries, compromising
the social contract.
The United Kingdom has recently introduced
changes to its public pension scheme designed to
improve the adequacy of pension for low-income
earners. The reforms will see the two-tier benefit
structure (a flat-rate basic pension and an earnings-related additional pension) being merged into
a flat-rate basic pension. The new flat-rate benefit
will deliver an enhanced minimum pension benefit.
Participants will be able to gain additional earningsrelated pension credits through external voluntary
pension arrangements.
The retirement benefits of the public pension in
Slovakia introduce a new indexation formula entering into force in 2018 which removes linkages
to the national average earnings growth constituted
solely by the consumer price index. Similar adjustments to the indexation formula have also been introduced in Azerbaijan, Czech Republic, Honduras

and Spain as part of broader reforms to their national pension systems.
Several national pension schemes have recently
announced upward adjustments to pension benefits,
namely Belarus, China, Georgia, Ireland, Mauritius,
Namibia, Nicaragua, Panama, Philippines, Portugal,
Russian Federation, Seychelles, Turkey and
Zimbabwe.
In 2014 the Republic of Korea introduced a new
formula for determining minimum pensions, which
resulted in the minimum pension being revised to
nearly twice the previous amount. Armenia’s national social pension system has also delivered pension benefit increases of 15 per cent in both 2014
and 2015.
Spain will, effective 2019, introduce sustainability
adjustment factors to automatically adjust new pension benefits to counter the increased life expectancy
of new pensioners. A similar adjustment was previously introduced to the public pension scheme in
Finland, where it is expected to have reduced pension benefits by 21 per cent by 2060 (OECD, 2015).
In Hungary a bonus 13th payment in the public
pension system is to be replaced by conditional
­indexation.

intergenerational solidarity that should be expected in
financing pensions.
It is important to take into consideration that the
adequacy of retirement benefits depends not only on
the quantum of the cash benefits provided, but also on
the costs of essential services such as health care, food,
accommodation, and so on. Furthermore, the assessment of the adequacy of retirement benefits is dynamic
and will therefore evolve over time as social, cultural,
demographic and economic conditions change.
4.8.1 Preventing erosion of the value of pensions
over time: Ensuring regular adjustments
An important consideration on the adequacy of pensions is their ability to retain their purchasing power
and real value. A good practice in the design of pension systems is the establishment of an initial income
replacement at retirement, and then ensuring the preservation of such income level for the life of the retiree.
Unless the quantum of pensions is adjusted or indexed,
the standard of living of pensioners will be jeopardized.
Conventions Nos 102 and 128 both call for levels of
benefits in payment to be reviewed following substantial

changes in level of earnings or of cost of living, while
Recommendation No. 131 explicitly stipulates that
benefit levels should be periodically adjusted to take
into account changes in the general level of earnings
or cost of living. Recommendation No. 202, on the
other hand, requires social protection floor guaranteed
levels to be reviewed regularly through a transparent
procedure established by national laws, regulations or
practice. The practice of indexation varies across countries and schemes, as shown in table 4.1.

While wage indexation was more popular in the
past, nowadays an increasing number of schemes guarantee, at best, only adjustments in line with cost of
living increases. The choice of an indexation method
may appear to be a technical detail, but it can have a
significant impact on the level of pensions, and consequently on expenditure on pensions. Where wages increase faster than prices, the change from wage-based
indexation to price-based indexation offers significant
reductions in pension expenditure but also leads to the
decoupling of pensioners’ living standards from those
of the working population. A classic example of this decoupling has taken place in Slovakia’s national pension
system. Pensions in payment were initially indexed to
a mix of growth of average earnings growth and price
inflation. Consistent with broader reforms to improve
the sustainability of the scheme, the share of earnings growth and inflation in the indexation formula
changed from 40:60 in 2014 to 30:70 in 2015, 20:80
in 2016, and subsequently 10:90 in 2017. From 2018
indexation will be based solely on the consumer price
index (IMF, 2017b).
Many newly established schemes provide ad hoc
pension increases. Particularly in inflationary environments, this results in a majority of pensioners eventually receiving nominal pensions with limited poverty

reduction impact. Figure 4.11 shows the average replacement rates at retirement in public pension schemes
across selected European countries, indicating a clear
reduction towards 2060 in projected data. Unless pensions are adjusted in line with increases in real wages or
other measures related to the overall cost of living, the
standard of living of older persons will deteriorate and
they may be subsequently pushed into poverty.
4.8.2 Reforming pension systems
in the context of fiscal consolidation
and austerity policies6
Under fiscal pressure, many countries (mostly highincome but also some middle-income countries) have
introduced a series of adjustment measures affecting
the adequacy of pension systems. More precisely, these
measures affect eligibility conditions and delay pension
receipt – for instance, by increasing penalties for early
retirement, raising the statutory pensionable age, and
indexing the retirement age to increases in life expectancy, among others. These trends, sometimes linked to
the fear of “implicit pension debt” (see box 4.5), pose
a risk to the maintenance of social protection systems
and the social contract.

In this report, “fiscal consolidation” refers to the wide array of adjustment measures adopted to reduce government deficits and debt
accumulation. Fiscal consolidation policies are often referred to as austerity policies.

4. Social protection for older women and men

Box 4.5 Implicit pension debt
The concept of implicit pension debt was formulated
by World Bank staff in the 1990s; it is an adaptation
of the concepts commonly used in the private insurance sector. A pension debt is liability created
when pension benefits have been promised but not
funded. The term is often defined in two different
ways: (1) implicit social security pension debt equals
the present value of all future benefits to present
pensioners and all accrued rights of current insured
members, minus the amount of the initial reserve
of the pension scheme; (2) implicit social security
pension debt equals the present value of all future
benefits to present and future pensioners, minus the
amount of the initial reserve of the scheme, minus
the present value of all expected future contribution
payments of present and future insured persons at a
constant initial contribution rate.
The first definition follows a strict private insurance
concept and was used by the World Bank in its publication Averting the old age crisis (World Bank, 1994).
The second definition is a variation of the concept and follows a public finance approach and
has been the definition preferred by the ILO (Gillion
et al., 2000); it reflects the principles of solidarity
and collective financing comprised in several ILO
Conventions in the field of social security.
The implicit pension debt concept has been used
as a justification for replacing public pension systems
with private pension systems based on individual accounts. The main argument is that large amounts of
pension debt associated with “unreformed” public
systems are allegedly being amassed. But implicit
debt only occurs if the present value of all future

In order to ensure the sustainability of pension systems the ILO supports introducing structural or parametric reforms, provided that such measures are in line
with the principles and legal conditions contained in
international standards on social security, including
the necessary gradualism in terms of implementation so
as not to abruptly affect the living conditions of older
persons. To this end, the ILO endeavours to monitor
reforms, as well as to provide technical support to countries in designing and implementing their reforms in
the context of social dialogue, complying with international standards and ensuring the participation of
ILO constituents.
According to data collected by the ILO Social
Protection Monitor, between 2010 and 2016 a total
of 169 contraction measures in pension schemes were
announced by governments from various regions of
the world, mainly in regard to contributory pension
schemes. Of these, 103 reforms were related to delaying pension receipt. These included raising the retirement age (72 announcements), the elimination of early

pension benefits minus the present value of all future
social security taxes or contributions is negative. If
contribution rates are increased in line with expenditure, or if expenditure is reduced through parametric
reforms to meet acceptable contribution levels, the
implicit pension debt disappears. The concept thus
implies that no parametric adjustments will be made
in the pension systems over many decades – which
is contrary to all historical experience. In practice, all
partially funded or PAYG pension schemes are built
on the assumption that contribution or tax rates will
have to increase periodically in the future to match
the natural maturation process of these schemes
(Cichon, 2004).
The discussion on implicit pension debt has
a direct connection with the level and pattern of
funding. Private pension systems are usually fully
funded, i.e. they have to have sufficient resources
to honour their obligations should the insurance
company, the occupational pension scheme or the
sponsor of an occupational scheme be dissolved.
If this condition is met, the scheme is fully funded.
Public pension schemes, which are backed by a
societal promise guaranteeing their liquidity and
– ideally – indefinite existence, do not require the
same level of funding. The level of funding in social
security schemes is determined by considerations
other than the exclusive financial safeguarding of
pension promises. Most social security pension systems are in practice partially funded. Even systems
which were originally designed to be fully funded
have often become partially funded when inflation
undermined the value of reserves (ILO, 2001).

retirement, the introduction or increase of penalties
on early retirement, the introduction or increase of
incentives for late retirement, and 13 cases of reform
measures targeted at increasing the eligibility period or
tightening eligibility criteria (see table 4.2).
The ILO Social Protection Monitor also records
37 cases of reform announcements by governments that
have reduced the adequacy of pensions. These include
25 cases of reform that have decreased pension benefits, modified the calculation formula, eliminated or
reduced subsidies on benefits, or decreased subsidies on
contributions. Other announcements include 12 reform
measures that have reduced pension system adequacy by
reforming the indexation method, freezing pension indexation and introducing or increasing taxes on benefits.
The global picture of reforms aimed at contracting
the costs of pension systems in the long term is largely
dominated by measures that delay the receipt of benefits
or reduce the years of receipt. In many cases, these measures are combined with other reforms to adjust benefit
levels. Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, India, Indonesia, Italy,

4. Social protection for older women and men

Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Republic of Moldova, Morocco,
Nigeria, Norway, Rwanda, Senegal, Slovenia, Viet Nam
and Zambia, among others, are some of the most recent
countries to announce reforms aimed at adjusting the
retirement age or eligibility requirements (table 4.3).
Based on current trends, it is expected that an increasing number of workers will have to resort to
tax‑financed social assistance or guaranteed minimum
income schemes in their old age as a result of the pension reforms. Unfortunately, after introducing the reforms, some national pension systems in countries
that have ratified ILO Convention No. 102 and/or the
European Code of Social Security will no longer meet
the requirements needed to fulfil them in terms of eligibility conditions and adequacy.
Countries introducing reforms to their pension systems need to find a suitable balance between sustainability objectives and retirement conditions, including
adequacy, in order to accomplish the purpose of pension systems. In the developing world, where the phenomena of poverty and informality are widespread, a
significant proportion of older and unskilled workers
are moving from formal jobs, with social protection, to
informal ones or to unemployment, which makes it difficult for them to meet the legal requirements for a contributory pension. In particular, the minimum number
of contributions, the retirement age and other related
parameters must be handled with caution in order to
ensure that the social protection system meets its objective of protecting all older persons. In the context of
the aims of Agenda 2030, it is important to consider the
need for pension reforms that reach the most vulnerable
groups, guaranteeing social protection floors for older
persons excluded from contributory pension benefits.

4.9 Reversing pension privatization
4.9.1 Lessons from three decades
of pension privatization
In the 1990s, many countries introduced structural reforms to their pension systems, to move from the public
defined benefit (DB) model to defined contribution
(DC) with individual accounts and private administration model. Structural reforms entailed setting up

privately managed and invested pension pillars with
defined contributions, investing people’s savings into
capital markets. These structural reforms shifted responsibility and financial burden from the public
sector and changed the way old-age security was viewed
(Mesa-Lago, 2014). A large number of the reforms
were designed and driven by the World Bank, based
on the argument of the impending crisis of ageing and
its impact on the sustainability of pension systems (e.g.
World Bank, 1994). The most profound and extensive
pension reforms modifying the financing model and
the role of the State took place in the 1990s in Latin
America, Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
In 1995, ILO and ISSA (Beattie and McGillivray,
1995) published a first report with a critical assessment
of the World Bank’s privatization strategy, arguing that
the strategy outlined in the report, involving the replacement of social insurance by mandatory savings
schemes, would cause an unacceptably high degree of
risk for workers and pensioners, that it would make
old-age protection more costly, and that the transition
would impose a heavy burden on the current generation
of workers. This and other ILO and ISSA assessments
conclude that a more efficient and less disruptive approach to the provision of retirement pensions would
be to focus efforts on measures to rectify design deficiencies and inequities in public schemes, i.e. parametric
reforms to public systems rather than systemic reforms.
Box 4.6 provides a view based on international social
security standards including those of the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and
Recommendations (CEACR).
Between 1981 and 2002, a small number of countries (24) undertook pension reforms introducing
either a substitutive, a mixed or a parallel model with
individual accounts (Mesa-Lago, 2014).7 Because of the
difficulties experienced by private systems in meeting
expectations regarding performance, some countries
have been gradually reversing their previous reforms in
different ways, while in other countries there are ongoing discussions to re-reform. At least six countries –
Argentina (2008), the Plurinational State of Bolivia
(2011), Czech Republic (2014), Hungary (2011), Kazakhstan (2013) and Poland (2011‌–‌14) – underwent
re‑reforms leading to a return to or a strengthening of
their public and solidary pension schemes. Others, such

Box 4.6 International social security standards and the organization
and financing of social security systems

94

Throughout the 1990s there was a drive to reduce
the State’s responsibility to provide social security
pensions by increasing the role of private institutions and gradually reducing the public tier. Such
new forms of delivering and managing social security schemes were not necessarily deemed to
be in direct contradiction to the framework of internationally accepted principles embodied in the
international social security standards, as the latter
were drafted in a flexible manner so as to take into
account various methods of ensuring protection
without prejudging any system as such, provided
that it adhered to certain core principles considered
to represent the cornerstone of the notion of social
security.
International social security standards lay down
certain general principles with regard to the organization and management of social security systems.
Thus, the Social Security (Minimum Standards)
Convention, 1952 (No. 102), provides that the State
must accept general responsibility for the due provision of benefits and proper administration of the
institutions and services concerned, and that social
security systems should be financed collectively
by means of insurance contributions or taxation
or both, such that the risks are spread among the
members of the community. Indeed, an essential
part of the concept of social security is for the risk
being managed to be pooled through collective assumption of the financial burden of paying benefits.
Other principles include the periodic nature of the
cash benefits; the obligation to guarantee their level
and to maintain their real value; the need for the
representatives of the persons protected to participate in the management of the schemes or be
associated with them in all cases where the administration is not entrusted to an institution regulated
by the public authorities or a government department; the exclusion of solutions which would prove
unduly onerous for persons of modest means; and
the establishment of an upper limit on the share
of employees, in order that at least half of the revenues of social security schemes will be derived in a
more social manner through subsidies from general
revenues or employer contributions. These principles were recently reaffirmed and strengthened
in 2012 through the adoption by the International
Labour Conference of the Social Protection Floors
Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202).

as Estonia (2009), Latvia (2009), Lithuania (2009) and
Slovakia (2012), drastically reduced the size of their individual account schemes by lowering their contribution rates and redirecting the financing to the public
defined benefit systems (Kay, 2014). In 2008, Chile
adopted reforms aimed at improving the balance
between social risks and individual effort throughout

Regardless of the type of scheme (public, private or mixed systems), these basic principles of
organization and management should continue to
underlie the structure of social security systems
with a view to keeping the balance maintained by
Convention No. 102 between the protection of the
general interests of the community and the rights
of individuals. In practice, experience shows that
certain of the above basic principles have proved
to be hardly implementable by certain new types of
schemes. For example, the periodic nature of the
cash benefits, or the obligation to guarantee their
level and to maintain their real value, cannot be
ensured by private defined contribution schemes.
Notwithstanding the different levels of protection
required by the international standards, there are
certain limits to reforms, particularly to those which
lead to privatization of social security, and the core
principles referred to above represent a guarantee
against social regress.
It should be borne in mind that the design of
a pension scheme is the result of a large array of
choices. Of these, two in particular stand out and
are often used as the basis on which to characterize
the scheme as a whole: (i) whether the basis of
pension calculation should be related to active life
earnings (so-called defined benefit, or DB schemes)
or directly to contributions paid (so-called defined
contribution, or DC schemes); and (ii) whether the
financial system should be based on the provision
of monies as needed for each year’s benefit payments (so-called pay-as-you-go, or PAYG financing)
or based on the advance accrual (from higher contribution rates) of assets which are invested in reserved funds (so-called full or partial funding). From
a technical perspective, each choice has advantages
and disadvantages. Many schemes seek to maximize the former and minimize the latter by means
of a so-called “multi-pillar” or “multi-tier” approach,
in which elements of DB or DC design, PAYG or
funding, are combined in selected proportions. In
recent years, a strong trend has developed towards
schemes with DC pensions, often associated with
fully funded financing based on individual accounts.
Such schemes (if implemented on a single-tier
basis) carry high risks for members, whose prospective pensions are very vulnerable to the risks associated with investment fluctuations – as seen vividly in
the recent global financial crisis.


a new tax-financed public solidary pension component,
and in El Salvador there are ongoing discussions to introduce some re-reforms to the private system adopted
in 1998.
Over the years, the central topics of debate regarding social security pension privatization and its reversal have been coverage extension, administrative costs,

4. Social protection for older women and men

Box 4.6 (cont’d)
For this reason, the ILO supervisory bodies consider that DC schemes often may not meet the requirements of Convention No. 102. In light of the
diverse range of possibilities, it is necessary to
analyse carefully both the adequacy of and the risks
associated with each national system in its entirety.
Over recent decades, many reforms have attempted
to restructure the public PAYG defined benefit systems through the establishment of often privately
managed fully funded schemes based on individual
pension accounts, which has resulted in the reduction of social solidarity previously ensured through
redistributive mechanisms. Ever since, the ILO supervisory bodies have engaged in an intensive dialogue with the governments concerned on a broad
spectrum of issues concerning non-compliance with
ILO social security standards. They have observed in
particular that pension schemes based on the capitalization of individual savings managed by private
pension funds were organized in disregard of the
principles of solidarity, risk sharing and collective financing which are the essence of social security, as
well as in disregard of the principles of transparent,
accountable and democratic management of pension schemes featuring the participation of representatives of the insured persons. The Committee
of Experts on the Application of Conventions and
Recommendations (CEACR) pointed out in 2009
that these principles underpin all ILO social security
standards and technical assistance and offer the
appropriate guarantees of financial viability and sustainable development of social security; neglecting
them, and at the same time removing state guarantees, exposed members of private schemes to
greater financial risks.
Recently, however, the developments which followed the international financial crisis led to the

reaffirmation of these basic principles through the
emergence of a new consensus for a prosperous
world economy, of which social protection and good
governance now form an integral part, together
with greater involvement by governments through
strengthening of the rule of law. In this new development paradigm, a precondition to sustainable progress is seen to be the recasting of the regulatory
framework of the financial system, strengthening
public oversight and consolidating solidarity-based
social security systems. It is noticeable that one of
the main lessons of the economic crisis has been
the conclusion that, where the schemes were financed collectively and fully managed by the State,
in particular through PAYG financing, the immediate
impact has been small. In contrast, fully privately
funded schemes, where individual savings were invested in relatively volatile products, have sustained
severe losses. The failure of so many private pension
schemes to deliver decent pensions, not least due
to the losses sustained during the financial crisis,
has led many governments to undertake a second
round of significant reforms, allowing workers to
switch back to PAYG schemes and re-establishing
or reinforcing solidarity and income redistribution
mechanisms. It is therefore possible to observe a
certain reinforcement of the involvement of the State
and the reconstruction of solidarity mechanisms
based on the principle of collective financing as
major components of national social security systems. Besides improving social security administration, management and supervision, public systems
more readily abide by the governance principles set
out in ILO social security instruments, as observed
typically in the well-established social security systems of high-income countries.

return on investments, adequacy of benefits, fiscal
impact and governance. Coverage rates and benefit
levels were expected to increase, governance of pension management to improve, inequalities to decrease
and capital markets to develop with the new allocation
of funds, supporting new investments and economic
growth. The following points reflect the evidence after
three decades of privatization reforms.
Low coverage. Evidence suggests that the introduction of individual accounts increased neither coverage nor compliance rates (Bertranou, Calvo and
Bertranou, 2009). Coverage rates and benefit levels
stagnated or decreased in most countries introducing
8

individual accounts. Argentina, after introducing the
private system, experienced a 10 per cent drop in its
coverage rate between 1992 and 2004, while in the
Plurinational State of Bolivia coverage did not change
and stagnated at 12 per cent. Likewise, coverage rates
in Hungary, Kazakhstan and Poland failed to live up to
the high expectations and stagnated or even slightly decreased against the pre-­reform levels. Mesa-Lago (2004)
states that the weighted average of coverage in nine
countries declined from 38 per cent before the reform
to 27 per cent in 2002 (post‑reform).8
High administrative costs. In most cases the costs
rose to high levels, well above the pre-existing levels in

These include Argentina, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. It
should be noted that the absolute figures in term of coverage differ between publications, yet the overall trend is the same, indicating a clear
drop in coverage during and after the reforms.

Box 4.7 Reversing pension privatization in Hungary

96

The Hungarian pension system was historically
based on a Bismarckian public pension model. In
the early 1990s it consisted of a PAYG scheme, an
anti-poverty tier and a voluntary private pension tier.
While an overarching parametric reform programme
had been developed by the Hungarian Government
in the early 1990s, pension privatization promoted
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank had come to dominate the agenda by the
mid-1990s, so that Hungary adopted the Argentinian
“mixed” model in 1997. The system reform was
accompanied by parametric reforms, including a
gradual increase in the retirement age to 62 years for
both women and men until 2009.
Hungarian as well as international banks and insurance companies (including AXA, ING, AEGON,
Allianz and Erste) entered the Hungarian private
pension market in 1998. Initially, a 6 per cent
employee contribution was directed to the private
second pillar, while the state-run pension fund received the 25 per cent employers’ contribution. The
public pillar remained dominant, but private pension
contribution rates changed somewhat over time according to political cycles. Future pensioners were
planned to receive 75 per cent of their annuities
from the PAYG pillar and 25 per cent from their individual private accounts.
Around the mid-2000s it became clear that the
positive impact that was expected to emerge as a
result of the privatization was not materializing. No
substantial positive effect on the Hungarian financial markets nor on employment rates and economic
output was observed. At the same time, the costs of
transition from the solely PAYG to the mixed system
increased from 0.3 per cent of GDP in 1998 to
1.2 per cent by 2010, leading to additional borrowing

from the IMF and an overall increase in debt. Real
yields of private pension funds lagged behind even
conservative expectations, due to high administrative
costs that rose above 10 per cent.
Intertwined internal and external economic and
political factors contributed to the reversal of pension privatization in Hungary, with the re-nationalization taking full effect in 2011. The driving factors
behind the reversal were the sharp fall in GDP and
revenues during the global economic crisis, and the
fact that a new conservative Government (Fidesz,
or Hungarian Civic Alliance) intended to use private pension assets to pay off the emergency loan
provided by the IMF in 2008. The Government
first redirected private pension contributions to
the State for an interim period of 14 months, and
later created unfavourable conditions that made
private pension fund membership very unattractive. As a result, 97 per cent of members opted by
2011 to be solely enrolled in the public scheme.
Accumulated assets were transferred to the newly
created Fund for Pension Reform and the Decrease
of the Deficit.
The Fidesz cabinet implemented its reform
agenda in an extremely short time. Opposition parties, trade unions and private pension funds were
not consulted. As part of the reform, the Government
eliminated early retirement and separated disability
benefits from the old-age pension scheme.
By 2012 Hungary had returned to its pre-1998
mandatory pension system. Despite the attempt
to correct the defects of the privatization process,
Hungary’s pension system still had major design
flaws. Concerns regarding the sustainability and adequacy remain unaddressed and will require action
in the years ahead.

the old public systems. There is extensive documentation of the high rates of administration of individual
account systems, explained by the effect of high management fees and high premiums for financing survival
and disability insurance. The direct consequence was a
significant reduction in the net rate of return for contributors, affecting the net value of return on investments, while the profits of the management companies
were very high. This unforeseen rise in administrative
costs in the privatized pension systems resulted in significant pressure on the benefit levels and their popularity. In El Salvador, the management cost of the
public system before the reform (as a percentage of the
worker’s wage) was 0.5 per cent, but rose to 2.98 per
cent in 2003 following the privatization. The highest
management costs emerged in Mexico and Argentina,

where they increased to 38 and 32 per cent of contribution payments respectively. According to Mesa-Lago
(2004), the non-weighted average of management costs
as a percentage of contributions in 11 Latin American
countries was 26 per cent in 2003. Even in Chile, the
percentage level of the total administrative cost initially rose from 2.44 per cent of the contributory salaries in 1981 to 3.6 per cent in 1984, and only declined
to 2.26 per cent in 2003, 22 years after the reform. In
Poland, distribution fee levels remained unregulated
until 2004 and some pension fund managers charged as
much as 10 per cent of the contribution value.
Lower pension benef its and replacement
rates. The shift from DB to DC systems in the privatization process had major implications on replacement
rates. The risk of financial market fluctuations was left

4. Social protection for older women and men

to pensioners, who thus risked losing their total life savings if financial markets collapsed, as happened during
the global financial crisis. A study by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) highlighted a decline
in replacement rates in the Chilean pension system
from 1990 to 2000, when half the private system participants received a declining minimum pension (Crabbe,
2005). Borzutzky and Hyde (2016) further state that
replacement rates were particularly low among women
as a result of low female participation and that overall pension performance in Chile was weak, resulting
in inadequate pensions. A financial (actuarial) assessment of the Argentinian pension system conducted by
the ILO in 2004 projected a drop in replacement rates
of about one-third. Further, Cichon (2004) concluded
that average pension amounts were likely to gravitate towards the minimum levels; according to Crabbe (2005),
an increased proportion of the population would fail
to qualify for the minimum pension, and as a result
the reformed pension systems would fail to fulfil their
purpose as old-age income protection. Altiparmakov
(2014) concludes that private pension funds in Eastern
Europe have realized rates of returns that are lower and
more volatile than the corresponding PAYG rates of
return, even before the financial crisis strongly affected
market returns. Last but not least, Ebbinghaus (2015)
points out the deteriorating effects of the private pension pillar due to lack of crediting contribution years
for child-rearing and long‑term care, and the interruptions in contribution years as a result of an increasing
share of atypical non-standard employment (e.g. freelancing) and premature job termination. All in all, pension privatization as observed in Eastern Europe and
Latin America has resulted in a deterioration of the
pension replacement rate and an erosion of the core idea
of a social contract based on solidarity, redistribution
and adequacy.
High fiscal costs. In most cases, the main source
of motivation for the introduction of private pension
systems was the fiscal pressures created by public pension systems, whether due to the existence of financial
deficits or pension liabilities in the long term. According to the evidence, however, the reforms failed to deliver an improvement in fiscal and financing terms, and
financing the transition towards individual accounts exacerbated pre-existing fiscal pressures in most countries.
The transition costs associated with moving from a DB
to a private DC system were vastly underestimated in
all countries, sometimes because no sound analysis
was carried out at all, sometimes because calculations
were based on unfounded optimistic assumptions. The

halt or substantial reductions in contributions to the
public system generated much higher transition costs
than expected, inducing additional fiscal pressure and
rising levels of debt. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, transition costs were 2.5 times the initial projection. Debt levels in Chile were still 4.7 per cent of
GDP in 2010, 30 years after the reform (Mesa‑Lago,
2014), while in Argentina the public system was running a deficit of 3.3 per cent of GDP by the year 2000,
with around 1.5 per cent of GDP accounting for contributions diverted to the private system (Kay, 2014).
In Hungary, the transition costs of the reform put a
fiscal burden on the Government that increased from
0.3 per cent of GDP in 1998 to 1.2 per cent by 2010. In
Poland during the period 1999–2012, the cumulated
costs of transfers to the second pillar were estimated
to be 14.4 per cent of 2012 GDP, accompanied by approximately 6.8 per cent of GDP consumed by servicing additional public debt.
Lack of social dialogue. A number of normative
ILO instruments establish the need to ensure social
dialogue and representation of protected persons in
social security governance bodies. Most structural reforms that privatized pensions in Central and Eastern
Europe and Latin America were implemented with
limited social dialogue, which later led to legitimacy
problems (Mesa-Lago, 2014). Prior to the reforms,
most public pension funds had some form of tripartite
administration through representatives of workers, employers and the government. The privatization eliminated such participation in the private system, despite
the workers being owners of the individual accounts
(in Chile, small AFPs initially had such representation,
but it eventually disappeared). Likewise, in Hungary,
the tripartite administration of the public system continued immediately following the reform but was later
abolished. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, the
original privatization was undertaken against strong
opposition from the Ministries of Labour and Health
as well as trade unions, leading to public demonstrations. In Argentina, in the framework of the discussions to return to public pensions, the Government
initially encouraged major debates including all key
actors in 2002/03, but moved very quickly and without any consultations when introducing the re-reform
measures in 2007 and 2008. It announced the project to re-nationalize the pension system at the end of
October 2008 and the new Pension Act was passed
without major changes and approved in both Chambers of Congress only a month later (Hujo and Rulli,
2014). Even though widely supported, the main actors

97

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

concerned by the reform, such as pension funds (Administradoras de Fondos de Jubilaciones y Pensiones,
AFJPs) and unions, were left with no time to react and
there was no scope for formal participation in the process (ibid.).
4.9.2 Turning back to public pension systems

98

The fiscal pressures created by private systems were a
major justification for reversing the privatization of
pensions. The wave of pension privatization reversals
coincided with the 2008 financial crisis. This increased
pressure on countries that had already been coping
with external fiscal constraints. In addition, countries
that wanted to join the Eurozone had to cope with the
Maastricht criteria regarding debt and fiscal deficits.
As a consequence of unmet expectations and the fiscal
challenges, many countries elaborated ways to reverse
their policy measures undertaken in the 1990s. Argentina terminated the individual accounts of its members
and beneficiaries during the global financial crisis in
December 2008 and transferred all funds to the PAYG
scheme under the newly established Argentine Integrated Pension System (SIPA). Hungary officially nationalized private pension assets and eliminated the
second private pillar in 2011, returning to its pre-1998
mandatory PAYG public pension system (see box 4.7).
In 2013 the Government of Kazakhstan merged the
ten existing private pension funds with the state-run
PAYG fund, forming the Unified Accumulation Pension Fund which is controlled by the Kazakhstan
National Bank. In 2014, the Government of Poland
transferred government bonds held by the private
funds to the public ZUS system, leaving the Private
Pension Fund Administrators with portfolios largely
in equities and thus substantially reducing the share
managed privately. In 2016, the Czech Republic completed a full reversal, terminating its individual saving
accounts system (Adascalitei and Domonkos, 2015).
As we saw earlier, in other countries, such as E
­ stonia
(2009), Latvia (2009), Lithuania (2009) and Slovakia
(2012), contribution rates to the private system were reduced, redirecting the financing to the public defined
benefit systems (Kay, 2014).

4.10 Ensuring income security for older
persons: The continuing challenge
Agenda 2030 calls for achieving substantial coverage of
the poor and the vulnerable and for the construction of
comprehensive and universal social protection systems.
Great progress is being made globally in terms of
extending legal and effective coverage of older persons.
The trend, however, shows strong variations, with major
coverage deficits persisting in most of the developing
world. Depending on the specific regional and country context, the major obstacles in extending coverage
to older persons include: lack of political will, which is
however imperative in supporting the development of
a well-functioning pension system; lack of fiscal space
for the financing of pension systems and to prioritize
expenditure in social protection measures for old age in
the long term; high levels of informality, in particular
in low- and lower middle-income countries; and the
challenge of building trust among contributors and
beneficiaries.
A positive trend throughout the developing world is
the proliferation of non-contributory pension systems.
However, schemes are often too narrowly targeted, leaving many people unprotected. A challenge for these
countries is to transform their systems into universal
ones in order to guarantee a floor of income security for
all older persons, leaving no-one behind.
Many developing countries (including those in demographic transition) have been able to extend their
contributory pension systems. In the Latin American
region, for example, developments in pensions during
the last decade include both the extension of tax-funded
social pension schemes and the expansion of pre-existing contributory schemes. The latter are linked to a set
of formalization policies. The main challenge for these
countries is to consolidate the labour market policies
that have made possible the formalization and extension of social insurance coverage, while protecting the
fiscal space already allocated to non-contributory and
partially contributory schemes.
While in most parts of the developing world the
focus is on extending coverage, discussions in high‑ and
upper middle-income countries focus on pension adequacy issues and financial sustainability, and on how
to maintain the systems. With ageing demographic
structures and mature pension systems, the main challenge in most developed countries is maintaining a balance between adequacy and sustainability. Trends in
recent years have been dominated by the introduction
of cost-saving reforms with a fiscal objective, by raising

4. Social protection for older women and men

the retirement age, reforming pension formulas and
reducing the overall level of benefits, as well as by diversifying the sources of funding for old-age income
security. Fiscal consolidation policies dominate the discussions around social protection systems, putting at
risk the social pact and the principles on which social
security systems were founded.
Pension privatization in the 1990s in Eastern and
Central Europe and Latin America brought many
promises, including higher benefit levels, extension of
coverage and lower fiscal costs. Yet, as expectations were
not met and the privatized schemes widely underperformed, often leading to reduced coverage and benefit
adequacy, the reversal of the pension privatization in

the 2000s reintroduced or strengthened the public
schemes based on the concept of defined benefits, with
elements of solidarity and redistribution.
It is worth highlighting that against the odds and
in spite of all the challenges faced by pension systems
around the world, great progress has been achieved in
income security of the older person, in particular in
terms of coverage extension.
In order to comply with the SDGs, countries must
double their efforts to extend system coverage, including the construction of social protection floors that
reach the most vulnerable older persons, at the same
time as progress is made towards improving the adequacy of benefits.

Towards universal
health coverage

101
KEY MESSAGES
nn
Universal health coverage (UHC) providing access to at least essential health care including
long-term care (LTC) protection (which, in addition to health services, comprises professional social care) is central to achieving the SDGs, particularly SDG 3 on UHC. However,
there are large gaps throughout the world. As a result, millions of persons, including the
majority of people living in rural areas and older persons, are left without any coverage and
access to needed quality care.
nn
Rural–urban disparities are staggering: 56 per cent of the global rural population lacks
health coverage as compared to 22 per cent of the urban population. Many of the excluded
are indigenous people and people with severe diseases such as AIDS. These serious inequities are compounded by health workforce shortages: rural areas are short of a further 7 million skilled health workers to deliver quality health care, compared to a shortfall of 3 million
health workers in urban areas. Also, deficits in per capita health spending are twice as
high in rural areas as in urban areas. Consequently, it is the place of residence that largely
determines whether people live or die; for instance, figures on rural maternal mortality are
2.5 times higher than those on urban maternal mortality. Globally, the most deprived of
health coverage and access to needed health care is the rural population in Africa.
nn
Significant efforts are also needed in respect of the large and steadily growing group of
older persons suffering from the gaps in coverage and access to LTC due to the fact that
the majority of countries throughout the world do not provide any LTC protection to older
persons. As a result, more than 48 per cent of the world’s population is not covered at all,
with women most seriously concerned. Another 46.3 per cent of the older global population
is largely excluded from LTC due to narrow means-testing regulations that force persons
aged 65 and over to become poor before they become eligible for LTC services. Only
5.6 per cent of the global population lives in countries that provide LTC coverage based
on national legislation to the whole population.
nn
Many health and care workers lack decent working conditions in the public and private
sectors alike, both within and beyond the health sector. Working conditions often do not
respect human rights, including labour rights, social protection coverage, occupational
safety and participatory processes through social dialogue.


World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

KEY MESSAGES (cont’d)
nn
Achieving the SDGs will require the extension of health protection by ensuring equity in
access to quality care and solidarity in financing, as well as providing decent working conditions and transforming unpaid work linked to withdrawals from the labour market into
paid jobs.
nn
In the absence of a sufficient number of skilled care workers, an estimated global 57 million unpaid “voluntary” workers are providing the bulk of LTC work. The large majority of
them are women who have given up their own jobs, income and social protection to provide
informal care for family members. Filling the global LTC workforce shortages (estimated at
13.6 million full-time formal LTC workers) will provide access to urgently needed quality
services and support the transformation of unpaid work into decent jobs.

102

nn
The current gaps offer considerable employment potential. Achieving the SDGs by extending
coverage and addressing the workforce shortages in health and LTC will contribute to full
employment based on millions of new decent jobs to be created. Indeed, each investment
in the creation of one job in a health occupation such as a physician or a nurse has the
potential to result in the creation of 2.3 jobs for workers in non-health occupations in
the country’s broader health economy, such as workers in the pharmaceutical industry or
those providing administrative, maintenance or laundry services, thus boosting inclusive
and sustainable economic growth as targeted in SDG 8.

5.1 ILO Conventions and other international
standards on health protection: An
enabling framework to achieve the SDGs
Health protection, both direct and indirect, is essential for achieving most of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). An enabling framework providing legal
health coverage, sufficient public funding and an adequate supply of health workers enjoying good working
conditions to provide quality services, has the potential
to reduce mortality and increase the health status of the
population (WHO, 2017). It thereby contributes to inclusive economic growth based on higher productivity
and the creation of decent jobs for health workers currently needed worldwide, with a view to achieving universal health coverage (UHC).
However, greater efforts and new health protection policies based on a “sustainable and resilient path”
(UN, 2015b) are needed to achieve the SDGs by 2030.
Cross-sectoral strategies and approaches are required,
given the interlinked social, health and economic targets; these range from poverty reduction highlighted
in SDG 1 and UHC targeted in SDG 3 to inclusive
growth and decent work (SDG 8), gender equality
(SDG 5), reducing inequality (SDG 10), and justice and
strong institutions (SDG 16). Enabling policies also
need to consider changing environments such as demographic ageing, economic developments impacting

negatively on the financing of health protection, workforce shortages and migration patterns resulting in
­inequities and barriers to access to needed care.
SDG-supportive policy frameworks, including
normative guidance for progress, are available in ILO
Conventions and Recommendations and other international standards (see box 5.1). Most relevant for the
health-related SDGs are the ILO Conventions and
Recommendations focusing on minimum standards
for social security (Convention No. 102), national
social protection floors (Recommendation No. 202)
and medical care (Medical Care Recommendation,
1944 (No. 69), and Medical Care and Sickness Benefits Convention, 1969 (No. 130) (ILO, 2017b). Other
ILO Conventions, such as the Nursing Personnel Convention, 1977 (No. 149), also play an important role.
Together with the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (UDHR), these international instruments
aim at universal health protection based on guaranteed access to health care for all in need through at
least essential health care, prevention and maternal
care. Access should be free of all barriers, be they financial, cultural, discriminatory or age-related, and should
meet the criteria of availability, acceptability and quality. In addition, the relevant ILO Conventions and
Recommendations highlight the need to embed health
protection in broader social security schemes and systems, for example providing income support for all

5. Towards universal health coverage

Box 5.1 Supporting universal health coverage: ILO Conventions
and Recommendations and other international standards
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR),
1948 and the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), 1966 set out:
• the right to the “highest attainable standard of
physical and mental health” (ICESCR, Art. 12(1))
and to “a standard of living adequate for the
health and well-being of himself and his family, including … medical care” (UDHR, Art. 25(1));
• the right to “social security, including social insurance” (ICESCR, Art. 9), “in the event of … sickness,
disability … or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control” (UDHR, Art. 25(1)); and
• the right to “conditions which would assure to all
medical service and medical attention in the event
of sickness” (ICESCR, Art. 12(2d)).
The ILO Medical Care Recommendation, 1944
(No. 69), emphasizes that “medical care service
should cover all members of the community, whether
or not they are gainfully occupied” (Para. 8) and provides comprehensive guidelines for the provision and
delivery of medical care, particularly the essential features of a medical care service and the entitlement of
persons covered, as well as the scope, organization,
quality, funding and administration of medical care.
The Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), states that medical care needs
to be provided “in respect of a condition ­requiring
medical care of a preventive or curative nature”
(Art. 7), in cases of “morbid condition”, that is, ill
health (Art. 8) and in maternity (Art. 8). Medical care

• general practitioner care, including domiciliary visiting;
• specialist care at hospitals for inpatients and outpatients, and such specialist care as may be available outside hospitals;
• essential pharmaceutical supplies, as prescribed
by medical or other qualified practitioners;
• hospitalization where necessary; and
• pre- and postnatal care for pregnancy and childbirth and their consequences, either by medical

practitioners or by qualified midwives, and hospitalization where necessary.
The Medical Care and Sickness Benefits Convention, 1969 (No. 130), and its accompanying Recommendation (No. 134), outline a more advanced
set of standards for medical care than Convention
No. 102, extending the benefit package to include
dental care, medical rehabilitation (prosthetics),
medical aids such as eyeglasses, and services for
convalescents. Convention No. 130 also mandates
those member States that have ratified the Convention to increase the number of persons protected,
extend the range of medical care provided and extend the duration of sickness benefit.
The Social Protection Floors Recommendation,
2012 (No. 202), stipulates that national social protection floors should be established consisting of
basic guarantees ensuring at a minimum that, over
the life cycle, all in need have access to essential
health care and to basic income security (Paras 4
and 5), including sickness benefits. According to the
Recommendation:
• the principles of universality and entitlement to
benefits prescribed by national law should apply
(Para. 3);
• all residents and children (Para. 6) should be
entitled to “access to a nationally defined set of
goods and services, constituting essential health
care, including maternity care, that meets the criteria of availability, accessibility, acceptability and
quality” (Para. 5(a)), without risk of “hardship and
an increased risk of poverty due to the financial
consequences of accessing essential health care”
(Para. 8 (a));
• social protection floors should be established by
member States with a view to “building comprehensive social security systems” incorporating “the
range and levels of benefits set out in the Social
Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952
(No. 102), or in other ILO social security Conventions and Recommendations setting out more advanced standards” (Para. 17).

includes extending coverage and access to health protection based on rights rather than charity. National
legislation is the backbone of equitable access. It should
ensure fair financing methods, adequacy of benefits,
gender equality and non-discrimination as well as
social inclusion. Implementing related legislation requires that quality care be delivered through a sufficient number of skilled health workers enjoying decent
working conditions.

Despite significant investments in health protection,
including in HIV/AIDS programmes, over the past
years, and efforts to extend coverage in many countries
at all income levels (box 5.2), large gaps towards the
achievement of the SDGs remain, particularly regarding SDG 3 on UHC. Thus, for many people throughout the world equitable access to health care for all has
not been achieved. As a result, health security crises
such as the recent Ebola outbreak in Africa could not
be tackled adequately by the countries concerned, given
the lack of efficient and effective health protection and
an unprecedented shortage of health workers which left
the majority of the population in these countries without care. In addition, the lack of investment in health
protection has resulted in foregone decent employment for workers, particularly health workers, as well as
missed targets on inclusive growth (SDG 8).
Related SDG gaps towards UHC, particularly inequities in coverage and access to needed care, can be
illustrated by focusing on specific population groups,
particularly rural populations and older persons. These
groups include particularly vulnerable subgroups such as
indigenous people and people living with HIV/AIDS.
Unfortunately, global, regional and national data on
health coverage and access to services of specific populations are very scarce, and where they exist at all they are
hardly comparable globally. Against this background,
the ILO has developed specific databases highlighting
inequities, for instance on rural and urban populations
(Annex IV, table B.13) as well as older persons’ unmet
LTC needs (Annex IV, table B.14). They focus on assessing the key dimensions of coverage and access to
health care based on Recommendation No. 202 (ScheilAdlung and Bonnet, 2011): legal coverage, affordability – particularly in terms of out-of-pocket payments
(OOP), availability of care based on a sufficient number
of skilled workers delivering quality services, and financial protection.
Further, with reference to SDG 8 on decent work
and economic growth, estimates of the employment
potential of investments in UHC are made available in
a global supply chain approach, meaning all activities
within and across countries that are required to provide
and deliver health-care goods and services in the public
and private sectors (Annex IV, table B.15). This includes
supplying and transforming raw materials, such as those
used for medicines, into final products through various
phases of development, production, distribution and
delivery.

5.2.1 The rural/urban SDG gap towards UHC:
Global and regional assessment
For all population groups, including rural populations,
the right to health protection is key for equity in access
to health care. We find, however, that the global deficit
in rural coverage is 2.5 times higher than that in urban
areas (figure 5.1): in the world’s rural areas 56 per cent
of the population remains without legal health coverage, while for urban populations the deficit amounts
to 22 per cent. Often, vulnerable subgroups such as indigenous people and people living with HIV/AIDS are
particularly concerned.

The largest exclusions of rural populations are observed in Africa and Asia (figure 5.2). In Africa, more
than 80 per cent of the rural population as compared
to some 60 per cent of the urban population is excluded from the right to health protection. In Asia,
56 per cent of the rural population compared to 24 per
cent of the urban population remains without legal
coverage. Thus, while in Africa the percentage of the
population excluded from legislation is highest, the inequities between rural and urban populations are greatest in Asia. In all regions, however, the rural population
is experiencing significant inequities in legal coverage
compared to the urban population.
One of the reasons for the rural/urban SDG gap relates to imbalances in health workforce shortages, causing high inequities in access to health services for rural
as compared to urban populations. In fact, rural areas

globally lack about 7 million health workers as compared to 3 million in urban areas (figure 5.3).
As a result, more than half the world’s rural population lacks effective access to health care due to the
shortage of health workers (figure 5.4). The situation
is most severe in Africa, where 77 per cent of the rural
population as compared to 50 per cent of the urban
population lacks access to needed services for this reason.
The multiple exclusions of rural populations from
access to health care are reflected in the need for substantial OOP in order to receive services, particularly in
low- and middle-income countries (figure 5.5). The highest OOP, exceeding 50 per cent of total health expenditure (THE), are made by rural populations in Africa
and Asia, in countries such as Chad, where OOP represent 80.4 per cent of THE paid by rural populations

compared to 45.2 per cent paid by urban populations;
or Pakistan, where the respective shares represented by
OOP are 70.9 per cent and 42.2 per cent (table 5.1).
The high amounts of OOP spent by rural populations are also due to the fact that rural areas are experiencing a significant underfunding that exceeds by far
the related figures in urban areas: it is estimated that
the lack of financial resources in rural areas results in
the exclusion from adequate health protection of 63 per
cent of the rural population as compared to 33 per cent
of the global urban population (Scheil-Adlung, 2015a).
The global assessment reveals gaps in progress
towards the SDGs: rural populations are experiencing more severe exclusion and deficit than urban

populations. At country level, these inequities may be
more or less distinct, as observed in the country studies
of Cambodia and Nigeria (box 5.2).
Given the evidence on inequities and gaps in access
for global rural populations, it can be concluded that
achieving the SDGs, particularly SDG 3 and SDG 1,
will require enormous efforts from governments, social
partners and other decision-makers in all countries
worldwide. Successful policies to reduce the rural/
urban divide will require equity-based strategies to
extend health protection to rural areas, and coordination with other policy sectors to alleviate poverty,
enhance income generation and create employment opportunities for health workers in rural areas.

5. Towards universal health coverage

Box 5.2 National perspectives on rural/urban gaps and inequities
in health protection: Cambodia and Nigeria
Primary health care is delivered in Cambodia through
a district-based system, and quality of care and health
financing are persistent challenges. This is particularly
the case for the rural population, which constitutes
about 80 per cent of the total population.
Over the last 20 years, the national Government has
attempted to address these issues, e.g. through the
1996 Health Financing Charter, which aimed at regulating the fee level for the use of health services.
However, the Government assumes that only a small
proportion of public health funding actually reaches
the service delivery level, still resulting in high levels
of OOP and a further expansion of the private sector.
Concerns about the cost and quality of public health
services have led to the growth of the private health
sector and the low utilization of necessary health services. Attempts have been made to address these
chronic problems, including setting up Health Equity
Funds, and several have been successful, but initiatives often operate at a local level only.
Consequently, high deficits in all dimensions of coverage and access are observed, whereby on all indicators used – gaps in legal coverage, exclusion due
to workforce shortages, financial deficits, OOP and
maternal mortality ratio (MMR) – the rural population
of Cambodia is significantly more concerned than
the urban population (figure 5.6). The most striking
finding relates to the huge urban/rural gap in terms
of OOP as a percentage of total health expenditure,
which can be considered as a symptom of public
health funding being less likely to reach the service
delivery points in rural areas than in urban areas.
In common with many other African countries,
Nigeria is experiencing rapid urbanization, with about
half its current population living in urban areas. Three
decades of political instability and economic crisis

have led to a deterioration of the health system and
poor performance on national health indicators.
Public spending on health in Nigeria is low, even
relative to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and
governance of the health sector is weak, with the result that a large private sector has developed and the
majority of health services are supplied by private providers. While the supply of human resources for health
is relatively high compared to other African countries,
planning and management tends to be poor (Kombe
et al., 2009), and thus the distribution of the available
health workers is rather inequitable.
This situation is reflected in the national assessment
based on the ILO health access indicators (figure 5.7).
They reveal:
• extremely low levels of legal coverage;
• a high staff access deficit compared to other subSaharan African countries;
• a very high financial deficit;
• high levels of OOP; and
• high levels of maternal mortality.

We observe that on three of the five indicators (staff
access deficit, financial deficit and maternal mortality),
the rural population of Nigeria experiences a worse
situation than the urban population. For the remaining
two indicators (legal coverage and OOP), there is virtually no difference between urban and rural areas.
In the case of legal coverage, this is because hardly
any Nigerian citizens have legal coverage, whether
they live in urban or rural areas. In the case of OOP,
the result may be indicative of an inadequate public
health system in both urban and rural areas, leading
to both types of dwellers being dependent on private
providers.

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

5.2.2 Global and regional LTC coverage

108

Another area of concern regarding the SDG gaps relates
to long-term care (LTC). LTC is mostly needed by older
persons with limited ability to care for themselves due
to physical or mental conditions and includes, for example, assistance with daily living activities, medication
management and basic health services. Despite population ageing throughout the world, the LTC needs
of older persons – an ever‑growing part of health and
social services – are largely ignored by politicians in
both developing and developed countries and, where
they are available at all, hardly meet the core requirements regarding rights to related social protection,
availability and affordability of quality services and
public funding. This is reflected in the large absence of
social protection schemes and systems focusing on the
LTC needs of the older person. The few countries that
offer related services at all often link them to income
testing and social assistance approaches and thereby
ignore the largely unaffordable and unavailable service
offer (even for those who are better off). As a result,
female family members are often pushed out of the
labour market to provide care for their relatives.
Among the reasons for ignoring urgently needed
LTC is the perceived availability of this “free” care to
be provided by unpaid female family members. However, this is an illusion: family care involves significant
costs, including income foregone by caregivers and their
associated risk of impoverishment later, due to a lack of
social protection during times of care, for example in
case of sickness, accident or old age. Further, providing
LTC requires more than compassion: it requires skilled
workers to deliver quality services, as well as coverage of
the related expenditure.
Similar to the financial and organizational approaches to health protection, LTC protection can be
financed through taxes or contributions, or both, and

can be based on social insurance schemes as in Germany, or on national systems as in Sweden. An overview
of common organizational and financial approaches to
providing LTC can be found in table 5.2.
Globally, most LTC needs can be expected to arise
in countries and regions with a high percentage of
older persons (aged 65+) among the population. Currently, the highest share of older persons globally can
be found in Asia and the Pacific (53 per cent), followed
by Europe (23 per cent), the Americas (17 per cent) and
Africa (7 per cent) (figure 5.8).
The assessment of legal coverage – the right to LTC
enshrined in national legislation – remains a dream for
most of the world’s elderly: a coverage gap for the SDGs
of up to 100 per cent is found in selected countries in
all regions. These include: in Africa, e.g. Algeria, Ghana
and Nigeria; in the Americas, e.g. Argentina, Brazil and
Canada; in Asia and the Pacific, e.g. India and Thailand; and in Europe, e.g. Slovakia and Turkey. Very few
countries, mostly in Europe, provide universal coverage.
They include countries such as Belgium, Denmark and
Germany; and in Asia, Japan (figure 5.9).

As a result, 48 per cent of the global population has
no social LTC protection and another 46.3 per cent is
largely excluded from coverage. Further, where coverage
is provided, often narrow means-testing regulations and
rigid eligibility rules hinder effective access to needed
services (Scheil-Adlung, 2015b).
However, also the availability of LTC for those who
are protected and can afford it is very limited due to
the workforce shortages of skilled LTC workers. Globally, only very few formally employed LTC workers are
available to deliver care to those in need. They amount
to about 11.9 million workers and are distributed inequitably: in Africa we find only 0.1 million workers;

in Asia and the Pacific 4.5 million; in the Americas
3.4, and in Europe 3.9 million. Recent estimations
have found that these numbers are insufficient by far
to serve all in need. In fact, the shortage of workers, at
13.6 million, exceeds the number of existing workers
(figure 5.10) if using a relative threshold of 4.2 formally
employed full-time workers (FTE) per 100 persons
aged 65 and more.
Consequently, more than half of older persons
worldwide have no access to LTC due to the insufficient number of skilled LTC workers needed to deliver
services. The percentage of exclusion is highest in Africa
(92.3) and lowest in the Americas (14.7) (figure 5.11).

Box 5.3 LTC protection of older persons in Ghana

110

In Ghana, a significant need for LTC has been observed. More than 40 per cent of the population
aged 75 and over stated that they needed at least
some kind of assistance (He, Muenchrat and Kowal,
2012). This was based on the fact that 88.1 per cent
of those aged 70 and over suffer from at least one
functional disability; 63.4 per cent have difficulties
moving around; 35.8 per cent encounter problems
with self-care in their daily life; and 74.3 per cent
report difficulties with cognition.
As the number of older persons aged 65 and
above will double within the next 35 years, the need
for LTC will increase and the traditional approach of
family member support will no longer be sufficient,
even if the extended family continues to be perceived
as responsible for providing help for older family
members with LTC needs. The family support system
is increasingly compromised by the processes of
modernization and globalization, for example when
younger people migrate to urban areas or other destinations outside the country. As a result, family ties

have already become weaker, and particularly in
urban areas a gradual shift from extended towards
nuclear families has been identified (Tawiah, 2011).
Today, 10 per cent of older persons aged 65 and
above already live alone (Ghana GSS, 2013).
These data indicate the urgent need for LTC services, but no legal entitlements for older persons to
access such services exist in national law (table 5.3).
Further, no public funding has been made available
so far and a public LTC system providing access to
quality care provided by formal LTC workers does not
exist. As a result, 100 per cent of the population aged
65 and over is excluded from coverage and access to
quality care provided by formal LTC workers. A total
of 37,436 formal LTC workers would be needed to
close the gap. The private sector has reacted to
the vacuum by offering home-based LTC services
to the few who can afford them (ibid.). Institutional
care for the elderly has been provided as a charity by
HelpAge Ghana, an international NGO, but remains
unavailable in most regions of the country (ibid.).

5. Towards universal health coverage

The situation at country level is illustrated in box 5.3
taking the example of Ghana.
Given the serious worldwide shortage of skilled
LTC workers, an estimated 57 million unpaid “voluntary” workers are filling the gap and provide the needed
care. Often, they are women providing LTC to family
members and have pulled out of the formal labour
market to provide services (Scheil-Adlung, 2016).
Due to the low coverage rates and often insufficient benefit levels to cover the real costs, OOP occur
in nearly all countries that provide LTC protection to a
varying extent. In fact, the share of the older population
in such countries experiencing OOP is estimated to be
very high, ranging up to 86.5 per cent, e.g. in Belgium
(table 5.4) and often reduces household income significantly (Scheil-Adlung, 2015b).

5.3 The employment potential
of investments in UHC
Achieving the SDGs and UHC will not be possible
without a sufficient number of workers with decent jobs
producing and delivering health care – not only doctors
and nurses but also workers in other occupations such
as administration or maintaining health facilities. In
improving the health of people in need, such workers
also contribute to higher productivity and thus economic growth.
The world is currently experiencing an unprecedented shortage in the health workforce, resulting
not only in lost improvements of the health status
of millions of people but also in foregone economic

growth due to lower productivity and employment opportunities. Currently, large parts of these shortages are
filled by unpaid “care workers”, often women, who provide care to older family members and others.
Transforming these jobs into formal work provides
the opportunity to achieve better health outcomes and
generate millions of jobs and economic growth. The
jobs required for activities within and across countries
to produce the goods and services needed are part of
national health economies and global health protection
supply chains. The expression “global health protection
supply chains” refers to the various economic activities
within or across countries and economic sectors that
are required to produce and provide goods and services
for health objectives such as UHC, transforming the
raw materials for medicines into final products through
various phases of development, production, distribution
and delivery.
If jobs are combined with decent salaries, social
protection and rights at work, they will generate considerable returns on investments specifically in countries with large health coverage deficits and informal
labour markets. Further, huge gains on investments
can be expected from revealing the economic potential of female workers who withdrew from the labour
market to provide care to family members in the absence of skilled health workers. Thus, investments in
health protection can be considered as a sustainable
domestic source of employment that creates inclusive
economic growth.
The workforce shortage currently leads to the exclusion from access to health care of 84 per cent of the total
population in low-income countries. In lower-­middleincome countries the deficits result in access gaps for
more than half the total population (figure 5.12).
The workforce gap includes not only workers in
health occupations but also workers in non-health occupations such as IT specialists, administrators and
workers in cleaning jobs, as well as the large group of
unpaid workers providing formal or informal care.
These groups together form the workforce of the health
economy and span many economic sectors beyond the
health sector, e.g. the pharmaceutical sector and the
service industries.
Current employment in the global health protection supply chain is estimated at 234 million, of which
about 100 million are working in Asia and the Pacific,
62 million in Europe and Central Asia, 44 million in
the Americas and 14 million in Africa (figure 5.13).
Workers in non-health occupations are a larger group
(46 per cent) than those in direct health occupations

(30 per cent of all workers in the supply chain). In addition, 24 per cent of workers are unpaid “voluntary”
workers in non-health occupations.
As the current numbers of workers are insufficient
to achieve UHC, significant efforts must be made to fill
the large gaps and shortages observed. This requires investments in the development of the needed workforce
and the provision of a sufficient number of decent jobs
in the formal economy.

The current employment potential to fill the gaps
and meet UHC needs is estimated globally at about
50 million paid workers calculated on median values of
workers per population (figure 5.14).1 About 18.3 million workers in health occupations and 31.7 million workers in non-health occupations are missing
worldwide.
In other words, each investment in a doctor or nurse
should result in jobs for 2.3 workers in non-health occupations to ensure that health objectives are achieved.
Thus, the usual assumption that investments in jobs
to deliver health protection are relevant only for doctors and nurses, for example, cannot be confirmed. In
fact, the employment stimulated is more important in
respect of workers in non-health occupations (often
with low salaries) delivering services in administration,
cleaning and maintenance of facilities, transport, retail
and wholesale within and beyond the health sector.
By 2030, world population growth will require
additional workers in all occupations to deliver UHC:
globally, 27 million additional workers in health occupations and 45.5 million additional paid workers in
non-health occupations.
In total, the current and future employment potential for workers in paid health and non-health occupations in the public and private sector of the global
health economy amounts to 122.3 million jobs. Further, it will be important to transform the work of the
existing number of unpaid “voluntary” workers into
formal paid work, filling the current workforce shortages indicated by the fact that they have given up their

own jobs and income, reduced their working time
or taken early retirement in order to care for family
members. Thus, the total global employment potential
amounts to 183.7 million workers.
However, the missing workers and their jobs are not
equitably distributed around the world: particularly affected are low- and lower-middle income countries in
Africa and in Asia and the Pacific. The majority of jobs
will need to be created in Asia (43 million jobs) and in
Africa (32 million) (figure 5.15).
Against this background, we can conclude that
investing in health protection will not only improve
health outcomes but will also generate millions of jobs
in national health economies, as well as in the global

health protection supply chains required to produce
the goods and services needed for UHC. Creating the
needed jobs and combining them with decent salaries,
social protection and rights at work will generate important returns on investment, particularly in countries with large health coverage deficits and informal
labour markets. Further, huge gains on investment can
be expected from harnessing the economic potential of
female workers who have withdrawn from the labour
market to provide care to family members in the absence of skilled health workers. Thus, investments in
health protection can be considered as a sustainable
domestic source of employment that creates inclusive
economic growth.

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

5.4 Policy priorities to achieve
universal health coverage
Successful policies for achieving the health- and poverty-related SDGs as well as the SDG 8 on decent
work and sustainable growth require a policy shift towards inclusive legislation on health protection including LTC, its implementation as well as labour market
policies that aim at decent working conditions for all
workers involved in the delivery of care – be they paid
or unpaid, in health or non‑health occupations. There
should be a particular focus on the following aspects.
5.4.1 Extending social protection and access
to health and LTC, and providing
universal coverage

114

Achieving universal health protection should be the
key policy objective when aiming to progress towards
UHC. It should be anchored in inclusive legislation
and implemented with a view to fixed timelines aiming
at the progressive realization of coverage and access to
health care. Fragmented implementation of such legislation and inefficient design might exclude large parts
of the rural or older population.
Sustainable progress also entails support for policies that particularly address rural and old-age poverty
and aim to close the gaps in social protection coverage
and income support; it further requires enabling labour
market policies to transform informal economies into
formal economies.
The principle of underlying policies to achieve
universality is equity. Equitable access requires non‑­
discrimination (e.g. by place of residence or age) and
meeting core requirements such as responsiveness to
specific needs. It also requires respect for the dignity of
all people. Further, maldistribution of health spending,
e.g. regarding the rural/urban distribution of the workforce and infrastructure for LTC, needs to be avoided.
In addition, universality and equity call for solidarity in financing and fairness in burden-sharing for
health protection. This entails risk-pooling based on
fair financing mechanisms such as tax funding and
contribution-based social or national health insurance
schemes. It is important that the funds generated or
made available are sufficient to ensure quality services
to all in need.
Moreover, financial hardship due to OOP, resulting in an increased risk of poverty, should be excluded
by providing adequate benefits and no or limited OOP

to make services affordable. Thus, the financial consequences of accessing health care should be carefully considered to avoid barriers to access and thus inequities.
Finally, policies need to ensure continued income
generation or make income support available to address the worst forms of health- and LTC-related impoverishment. This entails coverage and access to social
protection benefits ranging from paid sick leave, pensions and unemployment schemes, to other forms of
income support such as social assistance programmes.
Such income support is necessary to ensure equitable
access to needed services.
5.4.2 Creating decent jobs for a sufficient
number of health and LTC workers
When aiming to achieve the SDGs, it is important to
increase the availability of needed services and thus the
number of skilled health and LTC workers. They need
to be distributed in an equitable way within and across
countries in order to ensure UHC and sustained economic growth.
This requires the consideration of national and
global health labour market dynamics and a particular
focus on the low retention rates, for instance in rural
areas. To meet (future) needs and ensure the accessibility of health-care services in rural areas it is crucial to
train, employ, remunerate and motivate a rural health
workforce that is sufficiently large and skilled to provide quality health care for all in need. Related policies
often rely on migration and the recruitment of health
workers from other countries. However, this cannot
be considered a viable option, given the large gaps to be
filled. More promising are policies focusing on developing the health workforce in each country, with a view to
training and employing more health workers.
Health workers in rural areas should be provided
with decent jobs, including adequate wages that reflect
the hard and often painful work, and incentives to work
in rural areas where working conditions are typically
more disadvantageous. This can be addressed by prioritizing investment in infrastructure, equipment and
supplies for those levels and areas which most fall short
of the norms. Investments in workplaces are thus required, so that health workers can provide quality services with adequate equipment and supplies.
Employment opportunities should be created and
linked to meeting national health objectives such as
UHC. This involves thresholds estimating the number
of workers needed per population, respectively older

5. Towards universal health coverage

persons. Such thresholds can serve as a reference for
adequate service delivery; at the global level adequate
thresholds for health care are estimated at 4.1 full-time
paid workers per 1,000 persons and 4.2 for LTC per
100 persons aged 65 and over (Scheil-Adlung, 2015a,
2015b). This includes an adequate skill mix and training opportunities for health workers.
However, relevant policies and investments in job
creation should not be limited to achieving higher numbers of jobs, but should also consider decent working
conditions for workers in both health and non-health
occupations. Decent working conditions include adequate wages and are underpinned by rights at work
such as freedom of association, equal remuneration, nondiscrimination, social protection and social dialogue.
5.4.3 Ending the practices of unpaid work of
family members to fill workforce shortages
in LTC, and of voluntary community health
workers with minimal or no skills
It is crucial to transform health and LTC work provided informally and without pay due to the lack of
workers to fill decent jobs in the formal sector. This
concerns voluntary, often unskilled community health
workers who are unable to provide quality health care,
as well as those giving up jobs to provide LTC to family
members and others.
Such policies will allow many women workers to
return to the formal labour market and contribute
to inclusive economic growth. At the same time this
will create acceptable living conditions for those who
currently provide informal care, as well as preventing
poverty and promoting gender equality. The most efficient and effective ways of formalizing such care work
are the creation of decent jobs that provide adequate
wages, and skills development for the provision of quality care.
Still, those who decide to provide care informally to
family members and others also need to be supported.
Given population ageing, it is to be expected that a growing share of the workforce must balance caregiving with
paid employment. Combining these two roles currently
presents a challenge for many informal care workers,
often resulting in a higher degree of work–family conflict than for workers without care obligations. Possibilities of combining paid work with family care imply the
availability of support mechanisms ranging from cash to
in-kind benefits for caregivers, and should include rights
to leave and social protection.

5.5 Universalizing health coverage:
Recent trends
SDG 3 requires that all countries strive towards universal health coverage. An analysis of recent trends shows
that many countries have already worked towards
this objective by extending health coverage and access
through the development of health protection strategies, legislation and investment of significant amounts
of funds aimed at providing better access to quality
health and LTC services.
This concerns countries in all regions of the world,
including low-income countries such as Chad and Togo
which have invested in extending health coverage of the
population. But since it takes time to fully implement reforms, statistics often reflect the results only several years
later. Countries which have made significant progress towards achieving universal health coverage include China,
Colombia, Rwanda and Thailand (see box 5.4).
At the same time, setbacks are observed throughout
the world, including in high-income countries. Some
developments are often thought to be in line with financial consolidation measures and more general austerity
policies. However, such measures should be assessed in
terms of the negative impacts of ill health for the economy at large, particularly as regards falls in productivity, which as a result might be more costly than the
savings achieved. Given the ageing of the populations
throughout the world, the future will involve growing challenges to health and LTC schemes and systems requiring even higher expenditure than at present.
Policy-makers therefore need to consider whether shortterm financial adjustments are not undermining longterm investments in health.
Further, austerity policies show significant negative
impacts for the population, as they may force people into
poverty due to high(er) OOP and lack of income during
periods of sickness, as well as a worsening health status.
The most frequently observed measures to contract
health protection coverage (table 5.5) include:
• reductions in health service packages, risking consequent negative health impacts and thus higher
health expenditure at a later point in time, and
• limitations of legal coverage, resulting in exclusion
and inequities in access to health services.
Against this background, the intended objective and
expected impact of the measures such as increased efficiency of programmes and rationalization of public
spending can hardly be achieved. In fact, additional

115

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Box 5.4 Universal health coverage: China, Colombia, Rwanda and Thailand
In recent years, many countries progressed towards
universal health coverage, such as China, Colombia,
Rwanda and Thailand. Their health-care systems are
based on a combination of public health care, contributory schemes for workers in the formal sector
and partially contributory schemes for workers in
the informal economy, thereby fostering solidarity
and social inclusion.

116

In China, the number of people covered by health
insurance increased tenfold between 2003 and 2013
and now represents 96.9 per cent of the population.
Health insurance is provided through three main
schemes: for urban workers, for urban residents and
for rural residents. The first scheme provides a comprehensive benefit package that covers about 81 per
cent of insurable costs. The two latter schemes are
voluntary insurance schemes that cover more than
half the insurable medical costs up to a limit and
reach 1.1 billion people. As a general rule for poor
families, the Government covers part or all of their
OOP. The level of OOP as a share of national health
expenditures declined from 60 per cent in 2001 to
34 per cent in 2013, but needs further improvement.
Colombia is one of the recent cases in Latin America
where progress has been made in extending health
protection. The health system is based on the principle of universality, which obliges all citizens to
join either the scheme for those with contributory
capacity or the subsidized scheme for low-income
workers. Members of both schemes are entitled to
the same benefits. This has helped to achieve high
legal coverage rates and reduce OOP. Affiliation to social health insurance is estimated to have increased
from 25 per cent in 1993 to 96 per cent in 2014.
OOP fell to 15.9 per cent of national total health expenditures in 2011, and the share of live births attended by skilled health staff reached 99.2 per cent.
Rwanda has made significant efforts to develop its
health-care system at the national and community

levels, making it possible for most people to access
affordable health care: 96 per cent of its population was covered by the various health insurance
schemes in 2011, most of them (91 per cent) through
community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes.
Progress in coverage in Rwanda was achieved
through political commitment by a decentralized and
strong network of health facilities and health workers,
and the use of cultural elements of collective action
and mutual support. The CBHI schemes subsidize
the contributions for poor and vulnerable people,
which has helped to extend coverage to otherwise
excluded groups. They have greatly contributed to
improving health standards in Rwanda, including increased life expectancy and reduced child and maternal mortality. The experience of Rwanda shows
that progress is possible for low-income countries,
even when the vast majority of people live in rural
areas and are part of the informal economy.
Thailand implemented its Universal Health-care
Coverage Scheme (UCS) in 2001, consolidating several health insurance schemes and thereby reaching
a large number of previously uncovered people,
particularly in the informal sector. The objective of
the scheme is “to equally entitle all Thai citizens
to quality health care according to their needs, regardless of their socio-economic status”. This goal
is based on the universality principle: the UCS was
conceived as a scheme for everybody and not as one
targeted to the poor, vulnerable and disadvantaged.
As a tax-financed scheme, it provides free health
care at the point of service. The benefit package is
comprehensive and includes general medical care
and rehabilitation services, high-cost medical treatment and emergency care. As a universal scheme,
it controls the cost and ensures the financial sustainability of the scheme by fixing the annual budget and
putting a cap on provider payments. The scheme
has encouraged the development of health infrastructure and increased access to health services.

costs may occur due to a lack of sufficient quality treatments at both individual and national level. Moreover,
such measures may impact on the resilience and longterm stability of health protection schemes and systems
and thus worsen the social, economic and financial situation in the longer term.
Despite the globally increasing health needs due,
among other reasons, to demographic ageing, related
protection often remains inequitable, where it exists
at all. The situation is worsened by extreme workforce
shortages. In many countries, major barriers to accessing needed services include significant public underfunding and high OOP. Against this background,

all efforts must be made to set health protection and
LTC – particularly for older persons – high on the
global and national policy and development agendas.
This involves financing reforms generating sufficient fiscal space based on public funds, and minimizing OOP. Financing should be based on large risk pools
such as taxes or income-related contributions to ensure
burden sharing and sustainability. Quality services and
benefits at an acceptable standard should be “affordable”. Further, the development of adequate health and
LTC workforce is required.
In this context, returns on investment should be
considered, for example due to the often forgotten

“silver economy”, in addition to job growth for formal
workers and increases in employment rates for related
sectors, and contributions to GDP.
Finally, it is of key importance to embed health
and LTC strategies into broader social protection floor

strategies in order to ensure financial protection for
all in need, as well as coordinated social and economic
policies that reveal the full potential of returns on investment and contribute to efficient and effective LTC

Monitoring progress
in social protection:
Regional trends

KEY MESSAGES
nn
This chapter presents regional trends in social protection and provides an
SDG baseline at regional and country level for the SDG indicator 1.3.1.
nn
In Africa, despite notable progress in the extension of social protection coverage,
only 17.8 per cent of the population are covered by at least one cash social protection benefit (SDG indicator 1.3.1). Regional variations are large, with coverage
ranging from 48.0 per cent in South Africa to below 10 per cent in a number
of West African countries. Significant progress has been achieved for old-age
pensions, now covering 29.6 per cent of older persons in Africa, but reaching
or approaching universal coverage in Botswana, Cabo Verde, Lesotho, Mauritius,
Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland and Zanzibar (United Republic of
Tanzania). On the other hand, only 15.9 per cent of Africa’s children receive
child or family benefits, and wide coverage gaps remain in the areas of maternity protection, unemployment protection and disability benefits. Despite greater
efforts to invest in non-contributory cash benefits, only 9.5 per cent of vulnerable
populations in Africa receive them; the development of social protection floors is
therefore an urgent priority.
nn
In the Americas, the development of progressively comprehensive social protection
systems over many years has resulted in 67.6 per cent of the population being effectively covered by at least one cash social protection benefit (SDG indicator 1.3.1),
contributing to the reduction of inequality in many countries. Child or family cash
benefits now reach about two-thirds of children (66.2 per cent), cash maternity
benefits reach 68.6 per cent of new mothers with newborns, disability benefits
reach 59.4 per cent of persons with severe disabilities, and old-age pensions are
paid to 70.8 per cent of older persons. Unemployment protection, however, lags
behind, with only 16.7 per cent of unemployed persons receiving unemployment
benefits. It is worth noting that some countries have achieved universal social protection for children (Argentina, Brazil, Chile), universal coverage of mothers with
newborns (Canada, Uruguay), universal coverage of persons with disabilities (Brazil,
Chile, Uruguay, United States) and universal coverage for old-age pensions (Argentina, Plurinational State of Bolivia, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, United States).
While significant progress has been made, efforts to strengthen social protection
systems, including closing coverage gaps and reinforcing social protection floors as
well as enhancing the adequacy of benefits, remain a key priority in the region. 

KEY MESSAGES (cont’d)
nn
In the Arab States, limited data allow only a partial assessment of SDG indicator 1.3.1.
Compared to other areas of social protection, coverage for old-age pensions is relatively
well developed, yet only slightly more than a quarter (27.4 per cent) of the region’s older
persons receive an old-age pension. Limited pension coverage is likely to persist for future
pensioner generations, as less than one-third of the region’s current labour force (32.9 per
cent) contributes to a pension scheme. Positive developments include the introduction of
a social insurance scheme for workers in the private sector in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory, the establishment of unemployment insurance schemes in Bahrain, Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia, and enhanced coverage for maternity protection in Iraq and Jordan. However,
given the limited size of the formal sector in some countries and the large social needs, the
extension of social protection floors to vulnerable groups is a critical priority. In addition,
the region continues to face significant challenges, including the repercussions of the
ongoing conflicts in the Syrian Arab Republic and in Yemen.

120

nn
In the Asia and the Pacific region, recent years have seen a significant acceleration of the
extension of social protection coverage, contributing to strengthening social protection systems and building social protection floors. So far, though, only 38.9 per cent of the population in the region is covered by at least one social protection cash benefit. Wide coverage
gaps exist with regard to child and family benefits, except in Australia and Mongolia, which
have achieved universal coverage. Progress has been made in the extension of maternity
benefits, yet only one-third of mothers with newborns (33.4 per cent) receive cash maternity benefits. Similarly, for unemployment benefits, despite recent policy reforms in Viet
Nam and other countries, only 22.5 per cent of the region’s unemployed persons receive
unemployment benefits. Only a small minority of persons with severe disabilities (9.4 per
cent) receive disability benefits, pointing to a need to attach greater attention to this area.
Significant progress has been made regarding old-age pensions, particularly through the
introduction of non-contributory and partially contributory schemes leading to universal
coverage in China, Japan, Maldives, Mongolia, New Zealand and Timor-Leste; as a result,
the majority (55.2 per cent) of older persons in the region now receive a pension, although
adequacy of benefits remains a concern.
nn
In Europe and Central Asia, social protection systems, including floors, are traditionally
well developed and have achieved high effective social protection coverage under SDG indicator 1.3.1, compared to other regions. More than four in five persons (84.1 per cent) are
covered by at least one social protection benefit, with several countries reaching universal
coverage. Child and family benefits reach 87.5 per cent of children on average, given that
more than 20 countries in the region have achieved 100 per cent coverage. The large
majority of mothers with newborns (81.4 per cent) receive maternity cash benefits, yet
significant coverage gaps remain in Central and Western Asia. Coverage ratios for unemployment benefits are considerably lower: only 42.5 per cent of unemployed persons
receive such benefits. Much higher coverage levels are recorded for disability benefits
(86.7 per cent of persons with severe disabilities) and old-age pensions (95.2 per cent of
older persons), reflecting a long-standing commitment to universal social protection, not
only in high-income countries and EU Member States, but also in Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. However, ensuring the adequacy of pensions and other
social protection benefits in the light of demographic change and short-term austerity fiscal
pressures remains a priority.

6. Monitoring progress in social protection: Regional trends

6.1 Africa
6.1.1 Regional social protection challenges
and priorities
Africa is the continent where the greatest proportion
of the population does not have access to social protection and adequate health care, and where human
needs are largest. The experience of sub-Saharan
Africa with social development in the period between
1981 and 2005 was far from positive, with an additional 176.1 million people falling into severe poverty
(­Adesina, 2010).
Over the past two decades, Africa has experienced
robust economic growth at an average annual rate of
4.5 per cent. Policy-makers have started to re-examine social protection systems. African systems have a
high degree of heterogeneity and generally low levels
of coverage. Statutory social security schemes exist in
all countries but coverage is very limited, confined to
workers in the formal economy.
Universal non-contributory pension schemes have
been successfully developed in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Seychelles, Swaziland and Zanzibar (United Republic of Tanzania), among others. A number of other
countries, such as Algeria, Cabo Verde, Mauritius and

South Africa, have achieved universal coverage by a mix
of contributory and non-contributory programmes.
These universal schemes were “home grown”, developed by innovative African governments. Additionally, many countries have also developed cash transfers
in recent decades, often with significant donor support
(Mkandawire, 2015; Deacon, 2013). Some countries
have adopted life-cycle approaches to cash transfers,
with attention to different categories of vulnerable
groups and not focusing only on the extreme poor: examples include social transfers directed at minimizing the effects of HIV through transfers to orphans
and vulnerable children (OVC) and households headed
by older persons, and more recently cash transfers directed to food-insecure households. Currently there
is increased focus on ensuring that cash transfers are
complemented by adequate social and care services
(nutrition, prenatal and postnatal care, rehabilitation
services). Overall, social protection has become an essential element of national development strategies,
and African countries are advancing in the extension
of social protection, aware of the major needs in the
region (box 6.1).
However, after two decades of relatively steady
growth, in the past three years the average growth
rate in Africa has declined significantly. Despite the

Box 6.1 Africa’s commitment to extend social protection to all
The 2015 Addis Ababa Declaration on Transforming
Afric a through D e cent Work for Sust ainable
Development included in its continent-wide policy
priorities the extension of “social protection by establishing and maintaining national social protection floors based on the Social Protection Floors
Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202)”. The right to
social security for all is enshrined in the constitution
of the majority of African countries.
The Agenda 2063: The Africa we want, outlines
an African Union (AU) strategic framework for the
socio-economic transformation of Africa in the
next 50 years. The AU Agenda 2063 pursues the
goals of a “high standard of living, quality of life and
well-being for all citizens”, through the priorities of
affordable social security and protection for all; it
aims to increase incomes and provide decent jobs
for people of working age, leading to healthy and
well-nourished citizens, and affordable and sustainable access to quality basic necessities of life,
among others.
Social protection was affirmed as a key priority
area at the AU’s highest political level through
the adoption of the Declaration on Employment,

Poverty Eradication, Inclusive Development in Africa
by the 24th African Union Summit. The first fiveyear priority programme on employment, poverty
eradication and inclusive development covers six
key priority areas, including one on social protection, and has been linked to Agenda 2063 and the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development through
an alignment of indicators and targets. The AU is
assisting countries to incorporate the priority programme into subregional and national development
plans by the end of 2017.
The AU Executive Council has requested the
AU Commission to develop an AU Protocol on the
Rights of Citizens to Social Protection and Social
Security, which would be added to the African
Charter on Human and People’s Rights, a legally
binding document, and to elaborate a Social Agenda
for the AU Agenda 2063.
Moreover, SDG Target 1.3 on social protection has
been identified as a priority target in the contextualization process of the SDGs organized in several
African countries, notably Cabo Verde, Cameroon,
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sao Tomé
and Principe.

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Box 6.2 The demographic dividend and financing social protection in Africa
Africa is a young continent. The median age of its
population is 19 and in sub-Saharan Africa it is even
lower (18.4 years). This demographic dividend is a
positive factor for economic growth and financing
social protection. In Southern Africa, the adult
working-age population will increase relative to the
other age groups in the coming decades, while the
share of the elderly population will grow moderately,
and the number of youth will relatively decrease.
The growing working-age population offers the opportunity for increased production, while the declining overall dependency ratio means less demographic pressure on funding for social protection.
Higher spending per capita at constant spending
levels of GDP offers the opportunity to reach broader
segments of the population still uncovered, and

to improve the comprehensiveness and adequacy
of benefits.
In order to reap the benefits of such demographic
dividend, however, countries will need to increase
their current low levels of labour market participation
(especially amongst the youth) and bring down their
high levels of informal work and of unemployment
and under-employment. Cash transfers have been
shown to have positive impacts on production and no
negative effects on labour supply, but, on the whole,
existing support measures for after-school youth and
working-age people are insufficient. Likewise, policies for progressive formalization of the economy,
increased protection of informal workers and gradual
expansion of the tax/contribution base are largely
inadequate.

progress made in the extension of social protection, this
economic downturn may limit governments’ ability
to expand domestic funding of social protection systems. Even with the window of opportunity presented
by the demographic dividend in the region (box 6.2),
Africa faces a fiscal crunch that can hinder further development of social protection systems, even as a large
number of countries are in the process of extending coverage of contributory and non-contributory schemes.
In this context, African countries generally share
the following social protection priorities:
• The extension of social protection to workers in
the informal economy is one of the most pressing issues that States need to deal with. While most
people make a livelihood in the informal economy,
most of the existing contributory social protection
schemes cover only workers in the public sector and
the formal private sector (as well as their family
members), who represent barely 15 per cent of the
total population.
• The development of social assistance schemes
for those who cannot work, children, mothers with
newborns, persons with disabilities, older persons,
those without jobs, poor and food-insecure, needs
to be expedited to meet the needs of those who do
not have access to social insurance schemes. Despite
positive developments with regard to coverage of
social assistance programmes both by policy/law
and practice, only a few countries, such as Gabon,
Mauritius, Seychelles and South Africa, have largescale domestically funded non-contributory schemes
that provide people with basic income security.

• Capacity and institutional factors inhibit the effectiveness of social protection in Africa. They include lack of coordination, absence of rights-based
legal frameworks, financial constraints, or weak prospects of scaling up donor-led programmes, among
others. In this regard, the necessity to strengthen
institutions and capacity (SDG 16) is an increasingly important concern in Africa, as social transfer
programmes are rapidly being scaled up but remain
weakly institutionalized and integrated into comprehensive social protection systems. Social assistance programmes are not often backed by legal
frameworks and rights-based institutional and administrative mechanisms, for example allowing
beneficiaries to voice their grievances and appeal.
• Social protection in fragile States: Capacity and
institutional constraints are further aggravated by
the fact that some 40 per cent of African countries
are classified as fragile States and face a continuous
challenge in financing and administering social protection systems to improve the living conditions of
their sizeable populations. The lack of harmonization across regulations and operations fragments
their delivery and policy coherence.
• Social protection and resilience to climate shocks:
The potential role of social protection systems in
promoting resilience and responses to climate
shocks, to which the region is increasingly vulnerable, has become salient. A number of countries
in the region are integrating shock-responsive features in the development of social protection systems, for example allowing cash transfers to increase

6. Monitoring progress in social protection: Regional trends

coverage both horizontally and vertically in response to shocks, integrating resilient livelihood
support in social protection programming and enhancing coordination between social support and
emergency response systems.
• Social protection for migrant workers is a key
emerging policy area in Africa. Migration increases
the vulnerability of workers and families, who are
often not covered by any form of social protection
when they travel for work or return home. Eligibility to social assistance schemes is often restricted to
citizens or permanent residents, and the portability
of social insurance rights and benefits remains extremely limited.1

6.1.2 Effective social protection coverage:
Monitoring SDG indicator 1.3.1 in Africa
Africa will travel one of the longest distances in the world
towards the universal coverage of social protection by
2030. Most of its inhabitants have no access to social
protection systems, including floors (figure 6.1); effective
coverage – combining contributory and non-contributory schemes – is as low as 18 per cent of the total
population. There is significant dispersion across the continent; even the front runner, South Africa, is still only
half way through the set indicator of universal coverage.
Social assistance programmes cover on average a
small share of the population (and even of the poor or
extremely poor populations) and are in most cases targeted to households or individuals with limited or no
labour capacity (e.g. older persons, persons with severe
disabilities and, to a lesser extent, children). The limited
coverage of the active population under social assistance
schemes hinders the potential positive effects of these
schemes on economic development and productivity;
this has been extensively documented in the region
both at household level and in the local economy (Davis
et al., 2016). Additionally, schemes provide very low
benefits which are insufficient to guarantee minimum
income support.

With regard to contributory schemes, as mentioned earlier, only a small share of the working population – those formally employed – has access to formal
social security schemes for pensions, employment
injury, maternity and health protection. Workers in
the informal economy rely on individual coping strategies that are often costly and inefficient, and face the
risk of falling into poverty and deprivation at times of
hardship. In a number of countries (e.g. Kenya, Senegal,
South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia),
government and social security institutions are making
efforts to address social protection deficits in the

1
In May 2016, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Ministers of Employment and Labour adopted the SADC
framework on the Portability of Accrued Social Security Benefits within the Region (SADC Portability of Social Security Benefits Policy
Framework). The issue of portability is particularly important in the mining sector – the largest employer of migrant workers in the SADC
region (49.5 per cent) and the primary historical labour migration sector in this subregion, dating back to the 1950s. The majority of
migrants remain uncovered, as they are informal workers, from domestic workers to cross-border traders (Deacon, 2015). With regard to
the East African Community (EAC), in Nairobi a Draft Council Directive (multilateral social security agreement) for the Coordination of
Social Security Benefits was tabled for adoption by the EAC High Level Task Force (HLTF), stressing that the text should be regarded as
a regulation (directly applicable) and not a directive. Practical obstacles to the adoption and implementation of the directive/regulation lie
in the absence of social security funds in Kenya and Uganda; in 2011 both countries had provident funds. Recent conversion of these funds
may help greater integration and portability of benefits.

informal economy (Goursat and Pellerano, 2016). The
fragmentation across social security institutions, and
rigid social security administration and legislation, are
often constraining factors.

Effective social protection coverage for children is still
very limited: only 16 per cent of children in Africa receive child benefits. According to the data available,
40.8 per cent of African countries lack any child or
family benefit programme anchored in national legislation (but see box 6.3 for Senegal); and many of the
existing schemes and programmes cover only a small
minority of children – either poor and vulnerable children (in the case of means-tested programmes) or children of workers in formal employment (in the case of
most employment-related schemes) (figure 6.2). The
proportion of countries lacking such programmes is the
lowest of the developing regions, but at the same time
the proportion of countries where the benefits are related to formality is the highest of all regions (in those
regions where formality is considerably low).
A small number of countries have introduced child
grants (e.g. Ghana) or expressed the intention to do so
(Lesotho, Mozambique), in the form of an infant grant
to enhance the impact of social protection on child
poverty and early human capital development. Progress
with implementation and coverage expansion has been
limited, partly because programmes are embedded in
interventions targeted to poor or ultra-poor households

(e.g. Malawi, Namibia (see box 6.4)), and partly because
of continued scepticism on the part of policy-makers
about providing transfers to new parents (despite evidence, for example from Zambia, showing the remarkable impacts of this type of programme). None of these
ongoing schemes have matched the ambition and coverage of the Child Grant in South Africa (a model also
recently adopted in Namibia).

Box 6.3 National programme for family security in Senegal
The National Family Security Fellowship Programme
(PNBSF) is part of the vision of the Senegalese Head
of State in the field of social protection. It is based
on the reconstruction of solidarity and a redistribution of resources based on equity and social justice,
corresponding to useful forms of social assistance
which can mitigate the risks and shocks of poverty
for the most vulnerable.
The goal of the PNBSF is to contribute to the
fight against the vulnerability and social exclusion
of families through integrated social protection in
order to facilitate their access to social transfers and
to reinforce, among other things, their educational,
productive and technical capacities.
The modalities for the implementation of PNBSF are:
• the provision of family security grants of XOF
100,000 (CFA Francs) per year to strengthen the

livelihoods and educational and productive capacities of vulnerable families;
• the establishment of a consultation mechanism at
the national, regional and also at community level,
to take charge of social demand, for the benefit of
vulnerable families;
• strengthening the capacities of the actors involved
in the implementation of the programme, with a
view to improving the access of vulnerable families
to social services; and
• the creation of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to support families receiving family security
grants.
After a pilot phase in 2013, the programme has now
been extended over the whole country, covering
about 3 million persons.

6. Monitoring progress in social protection: Regional trends

Box 6.4 New social benefit
for vulnerable children in Namibia

Box 6.5 New contributory maternity benefit
in Rwanda

A new scheme was implemented in August 2015 in
Namibia: the Vulnerable Child Grant. This grant is
currently given to children whose parents have no
source of income or whose parents’ income is less
than NAD 1,000; children qualify up to 18 years
old. The intention is to progressively universalize the
grant. The benefit regulations are yet to be ­finalized
but 128,744 children were soon benefiting from
it, while the total number of orphans and vulnerable children benefiting from the grant system as
of March 2017 was 285,431. Beneficiaries receive
NAD 250.00 per month per child.

The Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB) has introduced a maternity leave benefit insurance scheme
to compensate all female employees absent from
employment due to pregnancy, giving birth and subsequently caring for the newborn child. According to the
provisions of Law No. 003/2016, mothers will no longer
face the hard choice of either taking 12 weeks’ leave
and losing 80 per cent of their earnings for six weeks,
or returning to work after six weeks to keep their income, as was the case before. The scheme introduces
12 weeks of fully paid leave during which monthly compensation equivalent to the mother’s last salary is paid.
According to the law, monthly contributions to the
scheme managed by the RSSB are to be 0.6 per cent
of the employee’s gross salary; both the employer
(public and private) and employee contribute 0.3 per
cent. This is a new social security scheme, whose establishment is part of the Government of Rwanda`s
commitment to allowing women workers to physically
recover, care for the newborn and avoid maternity
becoming a barrier to their contributions to national
development.

Source: ILO, based on national sources.

Maternity protection
Most women giving birth do not have access to maternity cash benefits. The majority of countries for which
data are available cover less than 20 per cent of childbearing women (figure 6.3). More specifically, provisions
for paid maternity protection exclude a large number
of women in both formal and informal employment,
with associated risks of income insecurity, maternal and
perinatal morbidity and mortality, and negative consequences for child development. The financing mechanisms (employer liability) increase female labour costs,
leading to discriminatory practices against women in the
labour market.

Some African countries have recently undertaken
efforts to move from employer liability to social insurance
coverage for maternity benefits (see box 6.5), a welcome
approach. Employer liability puts an unnecessarily high
and unpredictable burden on small and medium-sized
enterprises. It also adversely affects certain categories of
workers in the labour market, for example by increasing
the implicit cost of hiring women if maternity protection
is directly financed by employers. For this reason, several
countries have moved, or are considering moving, towards social insurance provision. In Zambia, there is ongoing discussion on the transit from employer liability to
a social insurance model for maternity protection.
Extensive support is required in the form of social
assistance for the majority of mothers with newborns; this
is a fairly cost-effective benefit attractive to policy-makers.

Effective coverage for working-age populations is relatively low. The regional estimate for the proportion of
unemployed persons receiving unemployment benefits
is only 5.6 per cent (figure 6.4), largely due to high levels
of informal employment and the lack of unemployment
protection schemes. Legal coverage ratios are also very
low, with 8.4 per cent of the labour force statutorily

covered (0.5 percentage points of which through noncontributory schemes) and with clear regional variations:
27 per cent of the labour force in Northern Africa is
covered but only 3.6 per cent in the sub-Saharan region.
Coverage of non-contributory social protection for
the “working poor” is in a large number of countries
delegated to public works programmes, empowerment
schemes and input subsidy schemes, as well as other
livelihood and support interventions. The latter are generally underfunded and have extremely low coverage.
The cost efficiency of public works interventions has in
some cases been questioned (e.g. in Malawi), although
there are also positive experiences where public works
programmes have been more strongly integrated with
regular cash transfer programmes, and have included
sufficient investments in skills transfers and the quality of assets built. It remains questionable, however,
whether these instruments can provide a basic floor
of social protection for large masses of population in
a cost-efficient manner. New initiatives such as Cabo
Verde’s contributory scheme (box 6.6) have been set up
to address unemployment protection, while South Africa’s employment tax incentive (see box 6.7) attempts
to support employment and enterprises.

Box 6.7 New initiatives to strengthen
employment promotion in South Africa
In South Africa, an employment tax incentive (ETI)
was introduced with effect from 1 January 2014.
The aim of the ETI is to facilitate employment of
young jobseekers. Employers are able to claim the
incentive for a 24-month period for all employees
who qualify. In addition, an active labour market programme was developed with the Labour Centres,
including revamped job search and labour-matching
intermediation services combined with financial support in the form of training stipends and coverage of
costs related to job search to increase the placement
of unemployed persons.

Box 6.8 New Workers’ Compensation Fund
in the United Republic of Tanzania
The new Workers’ Compensation Fund ( WCF)
was established in 2015/16 to provide access to
employment injury insurance for more than 2 million
formal sector workers. The benefits covered include
medical aid, compensation for temporary and permanent disability, rehabilitation services, constant
attendance care grant, funeral grant and compensation to dependants of deceased employees. The
WCF was established by the Workers’ Compensation
Act of 2008 and applied to both public and private
employers for the 2015/16 tax year that began on
1 July 2015. Since 2015 all employers have been
required to contribute to the WCF. Whereas private
sector employers are required to contribute 1 per
cent of each employee’s wages, public sector employers must contribute 0.5 per cent of wages on a
monthly basis. Benefits started to be paid in 2016.

Employment injury protection
The reliance on employer liability and direct compensation, still a predominant form of protection for a
considerable range of risks in many parts of Africa, entails adverse effects for both workers and employers.
Positive developments include those in Malawi and the

United Republic of Tanzania. The latter introduced a
social insurance workers’ compensation scheme in 2016
(box 6.8), while Malawi is in the middle of the implementation planning stage. In Lesotho and Botswana,
an employment injury insurance is under consideration
(Mpedi and Nyenti, 2016).

Disability benefits
Effective social protection coverage for persons with
disabilities is relatively low. While the calculation of a
regional estimate is not possible due to data constraints,
the available country data show that, with the notable
exception of South Africa, only a minority of persons
with severe disabilities receive any social protection
benefit (see figure 6.5).

as ­Botswana, Lesotho, Mauritius, Namibia and Seychelles provide universal pensions to virtually all older
persons. In addition, social assistance schemes commonly include older persons among the target groups.
While most countries adopt varying forms of meanstesting in social transfers to the elderly, a number of
countries are in the process of introducing universal
social pension schemes (see box 6.9). Countries such
as Cabo Verde (see box 6.10) achieve close to universal
coverage through the combination of contributory and
non-contributory pensions. Other countries (e.g. Mozambique and Zambia) are gradually relaxing their targeting approaches to achieve quasi-universal coverage

Box 6.9 New universal pensions in Zanzibar
(United Republic of Tanzania), Kenya and Uganda

Box 6.10 Non-contributory pension scheme
in Cabo Verde

Zanzibar (United Republic of Tanzania) implemented
a Universal Pension Scheme (ZUPS) providing income
security to older persons in 2016. The universal oldage pension covers all Zanzibar residents from the age
of 70 onwards, provided that they were residents for at
least ten years between the age of 18 and the age of retirement. With time, it is planned to progressively lower
this age to the legal retirement age of 60. As a fully
universal beneficiary, a pensioner from the Zanzibar
Social Security Fund (ZSSF – social insurance) will
­cumulate both pensions, as well as any other sources
of income. However, the majority of the working population in Zanzibar have been in informal employment
and do not receive any benefit from ZSSF. The first
payment for the scheme for 21,263 older persons
was made in April 2016, each beneficiary receiving a
monthly pension of TZS 20,000 (US$9.2).

In addition to the existing contributory pension
scheme, in 2006 Cabo Verde introduced a meanstested social pension for persons aged 60 and over
and for persons with disabilities, a scheme resulting
from the merger of two non-contributory pensions.
Management has been devolved to the National
Centre for Social Pensions (CNPS). Beneficiaries
receive a monthly payment of CVE 5,000 (about
US$50), which is 20 per cent more than the poverty
line. In order to qualify for a social pension, elderly
persons must reside in Cabo Verde, be 60 years of
age or older, have an income below the official national poverty line, and not benefit from any other
social security scheme.
Social pensions cost about 0.4 per cent of GDP
and are fully financed by public funds, with coverage of the target population exceeding 90 per cent
(23,000 beneficiaries).
A mutual insurance fund has been set up under
the social pension scheme to subsidize the purchase
of medicines in private pharmacies up to an annual
ceiling of CVE 2,500 (about $25) per person. The
fund is financed by monthly contributions of the
beneficiaries, amounting to CVE 100 per pensioner.
It also provides a funeral allowance of CVE 7,000
(about US$70) in case of death of the holder.

In Kenya, the Cabinet Secretary of Finance, Henry
Rotich, announced in his budget speech on 30 March
2017 the launch of a universal pension in the country
in January 2018. People above the age of 70 will receive a monthly pension. The initiative will operate
alongside the existing scheme covering older people
over 65 who are poor and vulnerable. Older people
aged 70 and over will be entitled to health insurance
coverage through the state-run National Hospital
Insurance Fund. The official launch took place on
5 July 2017.
In Uganda, the Senior Citizens Grant is a universal
pension covering all older persons of 65 years and
above (but lowered to 60 years in the case of the more
vulnerable Karamojong region). The programme was
initially piloted in 15 districts. The Vulnerable Family
Grant, on the other hand, is paid to poor and vulnerable households that lack labour capacity. Under this
programme, UGX 25,000 per month is to be paid to a
qualifying senior citizen, and a total of 123,000 senior
citizens (65+ years of age) benefited under the pilot
phase. Following the successful implementation of the
pilot, in August 2015 the Government announced a
phased national roll-out to an additional 40 districts
over the next five years. With 20 new districts in the
financial year 2015/16, five new districts will be added
each year until financial year 2019/20.
While Botswana, Lesotho, Mauritius and Namibia
already provide universal pensions, other countries
are planning the universalization of their non-contributory pensions. In Tanzania Mainland, the debate
on the introduction of such a scheme has already
started. A proposal is being discussed in cabinet. In
South Africa, the proposal under the comprehensive
social security reform aims to remove the existing
means tests and universalize the Old Age Grant.

through light affluence-testing. In Northern Africa,
the extension of social protection is on the agenda
following the Arab Spring (box 6.11).
On the contributory side, there are persisting challenges with the conversion of provident funds and
establishment of social security pension funds in Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Uganda, South Africa and
Swaziland. Planned pension reforms that were expected to resolve problems of long-term financial sustainability and gradually increase pension benefits are
taking a long time to be implemented in some countries (e.g. Zambia).

Social assistance
Most African countries provide limited coverage
through social insurance, which leaves a large proportion of the population to be covered through non-contributory benefits, mostly social assistance (Cirillo and
Tebaldi, 2016; UNDP, 2016). The regional estimate
for Africa presented in figure 6.7 shows that fewer
than one in ten persons (9.5 per cent) considered as

6. Monitoring progress in social protection: Regional trends

Box 6.11 Northern Africa: Old-age pensions
essential for social justice after the Arab Spring
The Arab Spring questioned the emphasis on economic growth that had relegated pressing social
needs to second priority in many countries in
Northern Africa. Social policy is now increasingly
seen as the main instrument to achieve social justice, with a focus on full employment, universal social
protection and social services for all. The extension
of social protection is on the agenda of all post-Arab
Spring ­governments.
With regard to old-age pensions, the most important element in national social protection systems,
governments in the Northern Africa region have been
examining reforms to address both short-term cashflow problems resulting from the economic slowdown
affecting the region, and long-term sustainability.
Egypt: After cancelling a proposed systemic pension
reform from a defined benefit to a defined contribution system that led to riots in 2011, the Government
of Egypt, with the support of the ILO, has been considering parametric reforms to improve not only the
sustainability of its public pension system but also to
improve the design of the system in accordance with
international social security standards. Partially financed by a World Bank loan and by savings from the
energy subsidy reform, Egypt has launched Karama
(“dignity” in Arabic), a means-tested old-age pension
benefit for poor Egyptians above the age of 65. Social
assistance programmes have been targeting only the
poorest, but in 2017 national dialogue has begun to extend social protection floors. Despite the improvements
achieved by Egypt, it will be a long road until universal
social protection coverage is achieved. In particular,
there is a need to protect all older persons through a
guaranteed and universal basic pension, as well as a
need to ensure coverage for other vulnerable groups.
Tunisia: Social protection and pensions are one of
the four pillars of the new Tunisian Social Contract
(2013), and the 2014 Tunisian Constitution recognizes the right to social protection for all. The
Tunisian social insurance old-age pensions seem to
take the direction of parametric reforms, in which
the nature of the system is maintained. Financial
sustainability of the pension system has become a
particularly pressing issue since 2016; as a result of
the fiscal deficit and IMF programme, there are pressures to introduce adjustments to deal with the shortterm financial imbalance of the pension system. In
the context of ILO assistance to the country, the
pertinence of the current social dialogue process for
social security reform is noteworthy.

through its social grant schemes. Social assistance also
reaches more than 10 per cent of the population in
Malawi, Niger and Zambia.
The extension of social protection floors to vulnerable groups is an urgent priority in Africa. As
presented earlier, a significant number of cash transfer
programmes have been developed in the region. In a
number of countries, these programmes are gradually
transiting from pilot (externally funded and, in some
cases, implemented) interventions to fully embedded
national social policy instruments. This poses a number
of common challenges regarding the institutionalization of social assistance. At the policy level, critical
questions arise in relation to the role of cash transfers
vis-à-vis other components of the social policy systems
(e.g. complementarity and linkages with service-based
interventions, emergency response and social insurance
mechanisms).
Design issues have also emerged in a number of
problems related to targeting approaches (Brown,
­Ravaillion and Van De Walle, 2016; Kidd, Gelders and

129

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Bailey-Athias, 2017), which has led to questioning the
role of social assistance in the broader social contract,
a trend towards universal individual entitlements observed across the region, and continued resistance to
the extension of income support for the working poor,
reflected by the renewed focus on strategies to “graduate” beneficiaries out of social assistance.
Countries need to strengthen governance and institutional mechanisms for the implementation of social
protection through decentralized government systems,
as well as to build capacity to develop stronger mechanisms for accountability, performance management,
monitoring, institutional and programme coordination.
Among the critical topics for scaling up social assistance
is the issue of financing, discussed in the next section. It
is imperative that governments identify new sources of
financing social protection to extend coverage.

6.1.3 Social protection expenditure,
excluding health
The regional estimate for social protection expenditure
in Africa as a whole, excluding health, stands at 5.9 per
cent of GDP, while that for Northern Africa is slightly
higher at 7.6 per cent of GDP, compared to 4.5 per cent
in sub-Saharan Africa (figure 6.8).
Social protection expenditure for children remains
low, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (0.8 per cent of
GDP) considering that the proportion of children aged
0–14 years in the population is 43 per cent (the highest
among regions) (figure 6.9).
The region has the smallest proportion of workingage population in the world. The proportion of expenditure as a ratio of GDP directed to this group is low, but
higher than in most Asian and Arab countries.
As in all regions, the lion’s share of the non-health
social protection expenditure is on the older population;
Africa shows the highest concentration of expenditure
on this group (65.6 per cent) even though it has the
lowest proportion of older persons among the regions
(3.8 per cent). More than 60 per cent of the non-health
social protection expenditure goes on old‑age benefits,
representing around 1.3 per cent of GDP (the lowest
among regions since at 3.8 per cent of the population
the share of older persons is lower than elsewhere).
The recent period of “bonanza” in Africa’s economic
growth has ended, with a number of countries showing
a more constrained fiscal position. In the current downturn, some countries are adjusting their expenditures.

bill, including for civil servants working in the social
sectors, are the main adjustment measures being considered across sub-Saharan Africa, followed by targeting of
social protection benefits (often reducing coverage) and
pension reforms. A discussion is presented in Chapter 7.
The removal of subsidies is prevalent in virtually all
African countries, from Angola to Zambia. This could
be a source of financing for the extension of social protection; however, the removal of universal subsidies
that benefit the whole population is often accompanied by a safety net consisting of cash transfers that

are narrowly targeted to the poorest, and is insufficient
for achieving the SDGs. For example, countries such as
Egypt, Kenya, Mozambique or Tunisia are phasing out
their energy subsidies that support all citizens. Only
the poorest are to be compensated by narrow-targeted
safety nets; the majority of the population, although
on very low incomes, will not be compensated, will
suffer a net loss of income and thus become more vulnerable. A number of food subsidies were phased out
too early, at a time when food prices were very high.
For this reason, the removal of subsidies has led to
in protests and riots in many countries (Ortiz et al.,
2015). A discussion is presented in Chapter 7. Cost
savings from subsidy removal should be used to expand
the social protection system for all, including floors, as
agreed in the SDGs.
Under fiscal pressure, more than 10 governments in
the region are considering pension reforms, as reflected
in the discussions with the IMF. They include Côte
d’Ivoire, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, United Republic
of Tanzania, Tunisia and Zambia, among others. But
the short-term fiscal pressures should not be an obstacle to progress in achieving the 2030 Agenda. There
are options to expand the fiscal space for social protection even in the poorest countries (Ortiz, Cummins
and Karunanethy, 2017). Countries must consider the
feasibility of the different financing options though
national dialogue. Social dialogue is best to articulate

optimal solutions in fiscal policy and the need for job
and income security.
6.1.4 Regional outlook
Most African countries have made social protection a
priority in their development strategies. Thus, national
social protection policies and plans have been adopted or
are being developed in almost all African States. Future
years will therefore be devoted to the following priorities:
• Extend social protection to workers in the informal economy as a way of formalizing and improving
their working conditions.
• Develop social assistance schemes for those who
cannot work, children, mothers with newborns, persons with disabilities, older persons, the poor with
or without jobs, and the food-insecure.
• Implement universal health coverage systems.
• Review national social protection policies (for example in Kenya, the new Social Protection Investment Plan 2030), combining non-contributory and
contributory schemes to reach universal coverage.
Identify new strategies to expand fiscal space for
social protection and secure adequate financing of
social protection systems, including floors.

131

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

• Strengthen social protection legal frameworks and
improve regulatory frameworks.
• Develop capacity and institutional strengthening,
particularly in fragile States, including better coordination in the social protection schemes.
• Improve access to social security for migrant workers
from Africa, including portability of benefits.
• Enhance resilience to climate and other shocks, integrating resilient livelihoods support in social protection programming and improving coordination
between social protection and emergency response
systems.

6.2 Americas

6.2.1 Regional social protection challenges
and priorities
Social security systems in Latin America and the Caribbean have evolved since the beginning of the twentieth
century in a fragmented and stratified way, creating
gaps in their coverage and inequalities in the scope and
adequacy of their benefits. Structural constraints on
their economies and the high incidence of labour informality have meant that in many countries the performance of social protection is undoubtedly unsatisfactory.
However, the last 15 years have been a fruitful period of
reforms and progress in deferred areas of social policies
and social protection, a phenomenon largely associated
with the positive changes experienced in the labour
markets of the region and also with the introduction
of innovations in terms of social protection (ECLAC,
2016). As a result, the incidence of poverty has declined drastically during the last decade, even more rapidly than in other regions of the world (Ocampo and
Gómez-Arteaga, 2016).
During the last 15 years, countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have experienced significant
progress in social protection due to the extension of
contributory schemes, associated with the recovery
of employment and also as a result of the expansion of
non-contributory social protection schemes financed
through taxation. Progress is reflected in both contributory and non-contributory coverage indicators.
Social protection and the good performance of the
labour market have been key to reducing poverty. Significant gaps still persist, however, due to regional
heterogeneity in terms of the adequacy of benefits,

effective coverage, public expenditure on social security and system performance. There are also certain
restrictions on the extension of the fiscal space for the
extension of coverage.
Problems linked to fragmentation, stratification
and lack of articulation and coordination between
programmes and institutions of the sector also exist.
Some groups and sectors are excluded from social protection or have very low effective coverage, such as
microenterprise workers, self-employed workers, and
rural and domestic workers, among others. Expanding
coverage to certain “difficult -to-reach” populations is
considered key for reducing gender and race or ethnic
gaps. Due to various constraints, effective coverage of
rural populations is a major regional challenge (ILO,
2016l).
The increase in coverage in the region is aligned
with the Sustainable Development Goals, in terms of
expansion of social protection, including health. But
there is great regional heterogeneity in system configuration, security levels, extent of coverage, public expenditure on social protection and performance. As a
result, regional challenges are very diverse, depending
on the country and the subregion. In those countries
with lower levels of development, the main challenges
have to do with the construction or extension of social
protection floors, the creation of fiscal space for social
protection, and the strengthening of social protection institutions. In countries in intermediate development, the main objectives are the consolidation of
the social protection floors, the extension of social
security to difficult-to-cover groups in the context of
formalization policies, and institutional coordination (Bertranou, Casalí and Schwarzer, 2014). On
the other hand, in the more developed countries of
the region, the main challenges are economic sustainability, maintaining levels of coverage and financing, deepening the formalization policies to continue
extending contributory coverage and improving the
quality of social protection spending.

comprehensive social protection systems, challenges
remain in the provision of universal coverage.2
There is a marked divergence in coverage levels
between Northern America and Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAC) (see figure 6.10). Developed economies in Northern America, represented by Canada
and the United States, tend to have higher coverage
rates, based on their higher level of economic development and social investment. Canada represents a good
example, but in the United States one in four persons
of the population does not have access to any kind of
social protection in cash benefits. Compared to Northern America, many countries in LAC still display considerable coverage gaps, with on average 40 per cent of
the population uncovered. Even more evident is the
marked disparity in coverage across countries in LAC.
While the positive example of Uruguay demonstrates
that higher coverage rates can also be achieved in countries that are at a lower stage of their economic development, in countries such as the Plurinational State of
Bolivia and Colombia, 60 per cent of the population is
still unprotected.

In most countries in the region, the provision of
social protection for children remains a challenge (see
figure 6.11). More than one-third of all children between
the ages of 0 and 14 are not covered. Some countries in
LAC have strengthened their efforts towards universal
coverage, such as Argentina, where around 85 per cent
of all children have effective access to the child allowance. In other countries where child benefits are provided through non-contributory means-tested schemes
only, for example in Costa Rica and Ecuador, coverage rates are lower, at 18 and 7 per cent respectively.
Effective coverage rates of more than 90 per cent are
achieved only in Brazil and Chile, both of which combine contributory and non-contributory means-tested
schemes. In Northern America, where data are available
only for Canada, the coverage is limited, estimated at
less than 40 per cent of all children aged 0–14.

Maternity protection
Effective coverage by maternity cash benefits stands
above the world average of 41 per cent; it is estimated
that 68.6 per cent of women in employment receive maternity benefits (figure 6.12). However, the differences
between countries are considerable, and challenges to
achieving universal coverage remain in a number of
countries. While effective coverage of 100 per cent of
employed women is reached only in Canada and Uruguay, around 50 per cent of women in employment receive maternity benefits in the Plurinational State of
Bolivia. At the other end of the spectrum, the levels
of exclusion in Guatemala and Paraguay are very high,
with more than 85 per cent of all women in employment not receiving maternity cash benefits.

Unemployment protection
Compared to other contingencies, the proportion
of persons of working age in the region who are unemployed and receive unemployment benefits is rather
low. In the majority of countries reviewed, less than
45 per cent of unemployed workers actually receive unemployment benefits (see figure 6.13). The only positive
outlier is Barbados, where 88 per cent of unemployed
persons receive benefits under the mandatory social

insurance scheme. In contrast, only 28.5 per cent of the
unemployed in Northern America receive unemployment benefits, with coverage in Canada estimated at
40 per cent and in the United States at 28 per cent. This
indicates that higher-income countries do not necessarily have higher coverage for unemployment benefits.
In LAC, unemployment protection schemes cover an
even smaller share of all unemployed persons (12 per
cent). Some countries in LAC such as Chile and Costa
Rica have implemented unemployment savings schemes
based on individual accounts, normally not guaranteeing a periodic payment. There is still some way to go
to achieve universal coverage, considering that 55 per
cent of unemployed workers are not protected against
the loss of income in the event of unemployment. In
Colombia and Ecuador, only a small minority (under
5 per cent) of unemployed workers receive unemployment benefits.
This can be partly explained by the fact that most
unemployment protection schemes are limited to salaried workers, hence leading to low effective coverage
rates in countries with a high share of non-standard
workers to total workers. In other countries, for example in Ecuador, the low coverage can be explained
by the provision of unemployment protection through
lump-sum benefits rather than periodic cash benefits.

6. Monitoring progress in social protection: Regional trends

Disability benefits

Old-age pensions

Social protection coverage for persons with severe disabilities varies between and within subregions (see
figure 6.14). Northern America leads amongst the subregions with a coverage of 96.7 per cent, with the United
States foremost, having achieved universal coverage. In
contrast, in Canada only two-thirds of persons with
severe disabilities have access to disability benefits. In
LAC, most countries have statutory disability schemes,
but the coverage varies significantly, with a difference
between the highest and the lowest, the Plurinational
State of Bolivia and Brazil, of more than 90 points.
While in countries such as Brazil, Chile and Uruguay,
over 90 per cent (in some cases, 100 per cent) of persons
with severe disabilities actually have access to disability
benefits, in others, such as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Guatemala and Peru, less than 5 per cent of persons
with disabilities receive a disability benefit.

In disaggregations by age group, older persons are
found to be the most widely covered population in the
Americas. Almost all countries have old-age pension
schemes anchored in national legislation. The difference in effective coverage of older persons between the

Americas (86 per cent of the target population) and the
global front-runner, Europe and Central Asia (95 per
cent of the target population), amounts to only 9 percentage points, whereas for other contingencies such
as unemployment the difference is around 25 points.
As shown in figure 6.15, in Northern America all older
persons above pensionable age receive cash benefits.
Both Canada and the United States provide universal
old-age pension coverage. In LAC, 71 per cent of older
persons receive an old-age pension, which is slightly
higher than the world average of 67 per cent. Yet significant inequalities persist in the subregion. Coverage
ratios of 100 per cent are found in Aruba, the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Guyana, where periodic cash
benefits are provided for older persons. In 23 countries
in the subregion at least 50 per cent of older persons
actually have access to old-age pensions which provide
them with a certain level of income security during old
age. However, old-age pension schemes in LAC are still
at a relatively early stage of development compared to
Northern America. For example, in Nicaragua around
one-fourth of older persons have access to old-age pensions; in Peru, fewer than one in five (19 per cent) older
persons receive a pension; and in Haiti only one in
100 older persons receives an old-age pension.

Social assistance
In terms of coverage of vulnerable populations, the figures are slightly different than for the population as a
whole (see figure 6.16). Northern America and LAC
both have a long way to go to achieve universal coverage by 2030. In the majority of countries in the region,
vulnerable populations face greater challenges than
others in accessing social protection systems – in other
words, the share of vulnerable populations covered by
social protection is even lower than that of the total
population. The share in Northern America is even
lower than in LAC, although the proportion of the
total population covered by social protection is higher
than in LAC. For example, the United States has significantly lower coverage of the vulnerable population
(31 per cent) among the total beneficiaries (76 per cent).
Likewise, in LAC, on average 39 per cent of vulnerable populations among the total beneficiaries (61 per
cent) have access to social protection systems. In Chile,
Colombia and Ecuador, fewer than one in five vulnerable persons benefit from social protection. Canada is
the only positive outlier in the region: almost the entire
vulnerable population is covered by social protection.

6.2.3 Trends in social protection expenditure,
excluding health
The level of total social protection expenditure, excluding health, in the Americas stands at roughly 10.4 per
cent of GDP, while that of Northern America is slightly
higher at around 10.6 per cent of GDP, compared to
9.7 per cent of GDP in LAC (see figure 6.17). The variation across countries is considerable. Brazil, Chile,
Uruguay, the United States and Canada top the list of
countries with higher levels of social protection coverage and expenditure. At the opposite end of the scale,
higher-income and middle-income countries such as the
Bahamas, Grenada and Guatemala allocate less than
3 per cent of their GDP to social protection expenditure, falling below the social protection expenditure
levels of several low-income countries.
Looking at the composition of non-health social
protection expenditure, it can be seen that a substantial amount of public social expenditure in the region
is directed at the older population, as in all the regions
in the world (see figure 6.18). This is the case for countries such as Brazil, the United States and Uruguay,
where social protection expenditure for older persons

accounts for around 50 per cent of total social protection expenditure. The distribution of social protection expenditure is more balanced in countries such
as Canada and Chile, while some others, including the
Plurinational State of Bolivia, Dominican Republic and
Paraguay, place more emphasis on providing social protection for working-age persons.
Even though the working-age population makes up
around two-thirds of the population in the Americas,
social protection expenditure for this group accounts
for a very small proportion of the total non-health

social protection expenditure. Many countries, such
as the Bahamas, Dominica, Panama and Saint Lucia,
reflect this trend. In these countries, less than 20 per
cent of total social protection expenditure is allocated to persons of working age. However, a significant number of countries in the region allocate more
of their resources to respond to the income security
needs of working-age persons than to older persons or
children; for example, Belize, the Plurinational State
of Bolivia, Dominican Republic and Paraguay spend
more than 60 per cent of their resources on the social
protection of working-age people and on general social
assistance. The number of countries in the Americas
(16 out of 34) that concentrate their social protection expenditure on working-age people is relatively
high compared to other world regions. For instance,
in Europe and Central Asia, only four countries allocate more non-health social protection expenditure to
working-age persons than to older persons.
As in all other regions, a very small share of nonhealth public expenditure is directed towards the social
protection of children. Public social protection expenditure for children takes the highest proportion of
GDP in Chile, at 1.7 per cent, followed by 1.5 per cent
of GDP in Argentina, but accounts for only 0.1 per
cent of GDP in Saint Lucia and 0.02 per cent of GDP
in the Dominican Republic. Some countries such as
Cuba, Grenada and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela neither have a social protection programme for
children anchored in national legislation nor spend resources on wider social assistance programmes ­targeted
to children.
Public social protection expenditure for children in
LAC amounts to only around one-tenth of public social
protection expenditure for older persons, even though
the share of children in the total population is significantly higher: children make up 25 per cent of LAC’s
total population and older persons 7.6 per cent. In
Northern America, 20 times as much is spent for social
protection of older persons than for children, although
children represent a larger share of the total population.
In general, the low expenditure levels for children compared to other population groups point to a significant
underinvestment in social protection for children. This
may have devastating effects on child poverty and other
indicators of children’s well-being such as nutrition
rates, particularly in regions with relatively high shares
of children in the total population. Despite significant
declines, the incidence of child poverty in LAC remains
high (Lucchetti et al., 2016). If the resources allocated
to the social protection of children are not increased,

negative effects are likely to occur in the future – that
is, the future workforce is likely to be limited in realizing its full economic and social potential.
Though the Americas as a region experienced
a decade of high economic growth that generally allowed the extension of social protection, a number of
countries in Central America and the Caribbean were
in a worse fiscal position and considering adjustment
reforms, such as pension reforms under discussion in
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica,
Nicaragua and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Subsidy reform affects eight countries across the region,
including the Plurinational State of Bolivia, El Salvador, Guyana, Paraguay and Nicaragua and Suriname;
reducing subsidies could be a source of funding for the
extension of social protection coverage (a discussion is
presented in Chapter 7). Containing the public sector
wage bill, including for civil servants working in the
social sectors, is another frequent short-term austerity
measure affecting Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Grenada, Jamaica, Mexico and Suriname, among others
(Ortiz et al., 2015). In 2016, a new government in Brazil
opted for a 20-year freeze in public expenditures which
is expected to have negative social impacts and affect
progress towards the achievement of human rights.3

It is important that these short-term adjustments do
not undermine progress towards achieving the SDGs.
Government expenditure cuts are not inevitable during
adjustment periods; there are alternatives to expand
fiscal space for social protection, even in the poorest
countries. In fact, there is a wide variety of options to
expand fiscal space and generate resources for social
investments, all supported by the United Nations and
international financial institutions (Ortiz, Cummins
and Karunanethy, 2017). Countries must consider the
feasibility of the different financing options through
national dialogue. Social dialogue is best to articulate
optimal solutions in fiscal policy and the need for job
and income security.
6.2.4 Regional outlook
During the last few years there have been important
changes in the characteristics and scope of social protection systems in the Americas region. Thanks to the favourable evolution of the labour markets, accompanied
by expansion of the fiscal space for social protection,
almost all the countries have extended their non-contributory programmes, complementing the similarly

The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, Philip Alston, warned on 9 December 2016 that Brazil’s
20-year public expenditure cap will breach human rights (OHCHR, 2016).

6. Monitoring progress in social protection: Regional trends

greater coverage achieved by contributory schemes. As
a result of advances in labour institutions, a number
of countries have expanded their legal coverage to new
groups of workers and improved the indicators of wage
employment and formalization. Labour administration,
labour inspection, and innovations in collecting social
security contributions have played a critical role in explaining this performance. However, coverage, administrative and financing gaps persist in many areas.
In order to achieve the SDGs, good progress on
social protection in the region must continue, addressing the following priorities:
• Increase the levels of formalization of the economy,
thus guaranteeing a double impact, on adequacy
and on effective coverage, extending social insurance schemes to difficult-to-cover groups such as
rural workers, the self-employed, domestic workers
and migrant workers, among others.
• Expand the effective coverage of social protection
for children and other vulnerable groups by closing
the remaining gaps in access to cash transfers and
improving adequacy.
• Design and implement strategies to increase fiscal
space and improve the distributive impact of fiscal
policy, in order to support improvements to social
protection systems.
• Extend legal and effective coverage of unemployment protection systems.
• Guarantee the effective access of the population to
health services and reduce the fragmentation, including in terms of rights, in health systems.
• Ensure the sustainability of contributory pension systems, without affecting adequacy, and increase the coverage of older persons through mixed
schemes (contributory and non-contributory).
• Reduce fragmentation and internal segmentation
of benefit schemes, and improve the coordination
of social protection policies among them and with
other social policies.
• Implement effective mechanisms to adapt social
protection policies to technological, demographic
and climatic changes.

6.3 Arab States
6.3.1 Regional social protection challenges
and priorities
While the need for social protection is widely recognized, the fundamental human right to social security
remains unfulfilled for a vast majority of the world’s
population, including in the Arab States.
Although most Arab countries have established
social security programmes and institutions over the
last decades, effective social security coverage remains
low as most social insurance schemes cater only to
public and private sector workers with regular contracts, while other categories of workers, including in
new forms of work, are excluded from coverage. High
rates of informality, low female labour market participation and high levels of unemployment contribute to
the effectively low social protection coverage rates, particularly for women (no more than 10 per cent in most
countries).
While all countries offer subsidies on goods (notably on commodities such as oil and food) and some
targeted cash transfers, the effectiveness of these measures in reducing poverty and vulnerability is limited.
Most cash transfer and safety net programmes are not
rights-based; they are small in scope, fragmented, with
limited coverage and benefits, yet often imply heavy administration costs. Scattered resources allow for only
small transfers to beneficiaries, and some households
in need are excluded because they do not meet specific eligibility requirements (ESCWA, 2014). Zakat
funds,4 charities and faith-based organizations also
play an important role in the delivery of social protection in the region. Although little information is available, it is estimated that religious organizations spend
tens of millions of US dollars, benefiting thousands of
people (Jawad, 2014). Non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) also provide means-tested benefits to certain
categories of recipients in particular locations, mainly
through school and hospital networks, as well as cash
and in-kind transfers to poor households. They have
gained in importance as major humanitarian aid providers during the refugee crisis.
The message from the global economic and financial crisis of 2008 about the valuable dual role of social
protection in providing income security to the vulnerable and preserving social cohesion in periods of crisis
or failed economic policies, was reinforced in the region

Zakat is a religious duty for Muslims whose wealth exceeds a certain threshold, and involves donating 2.5 per cent of one’s wealth.

following the Arab Spring uprisings. This was the case
in sustaining growth and protecting the populations in
the Arab States from adverse effects of food, fuel and financial shocks (ILO, 2014a). Most Arab countries have
introduced or expanded their social protection measures since 2010, including the countries that were not
visibly affected by the uprisings. However, most of these
measures, aimed at securing social stability and a recovery strategy in conflict countries, still fall short of addressing structural challenges and strengthening social
protection systems.
The refugee crisis and political instability (e.g. in
Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen), fiscal consolidation measures, as well as corruption and nontransparency (Ottaway, 2016), are jeopardizing the
efforts made to extend social security coverage.
In addition, the conflicts in the region and related
refugee crises have negatively affected the social protection systems in many of the Arab States, given the
already weak existing social protection administrations (Jawad, 2015). Lebanon, for example, is hosting
more than a million refugees, the highest per capita
concentration of refugees in the world (Renda, 2017).
The number of people living below the poverty line in
Lebanon has risen by 66 per cent since 2011, and according to World Bank estimates, 170,000 Lebanese
became poor between 2011 and 2014. Also, almost
350,000 Syrian refugees residing in Lebanon are estimated to be unable to meet their minimum survival
needs, and around 350,000 Lebanese live on less than
US$1 per day (Kukrety, 2016).
Given the low social protection coverage rates in the
Arab States, due to the structural weaknesses of the systems and exacerbated by political instability, there is an
urgent need to develop national social protection floors
which provide a minimum income security to all those
in need.
Social protection is explicitly mentioned as a key
instrument for the achievement of SDGs 1, 5 and 10,
in addition to SDGs 3 and 8. In the case of the Arab
States, one of the prerequisites for reaching these goals
is the establishment of an effective and efficient partnership between the multiple stakeholders: governments, employers’ and workers’ organizations, including
those in the informal economy, and civil society. However, one of the challenges for achieving the SDGs is
the limited margin of freedoms in the region, specifically freedom of association, expression and peaceful
assembly. Furthermore, to be effective in monitoring
5

See https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/vnrs/.

the SDGs, nationally generated data will be required
for the majority of the indicators. This will be a challenge, given the lack of standardized data collection
methods in most of the Arab countries. This may be the
reason why only two countries from the region, namely
Jordan and Qatar, presented a SDGs Voluntary National Review Report (VNR) at the High-level Political
Forum for Sustainable Development in July 2017.5 Not
only does the absence of poverty data for most Arab
countries restrict any monitoring of the achievement
of the SDGs, but the data available do not always correspond to other sources. Thus, political will is the important missing piece in achieving the SDGs.
The region is also facing unprecedented levels of
forced displacement of individuals due to recent conflicts and the resulting humanitarian crises. The war in
the Syrian Arab Republic alone has produced millions
of refugees, over 1.5 million of whom are registered in
neighbouring Jordan and Lebanon (UNHCR, 2017a).
Meanwhile, the conflicts in Iraq and Yemen have displaced millions of people across those two countries,
while Yemen hosts over a quarter million refugees fleeing the Horn of Africa (UNHCR, 2017b, 2017c).
In most cases, those seeking refuge abroad are not
eligible to participate in the social protection programmes of their host country. Instead, the welfare
of the region’s displaced populations is often the responsibility of humanitarian actors. But as many of the
region’s crises become protracted, other solutions are
being sought to help address the longer-term needs of
these populations, including income security in old age.
Together with partners such as UNHCR, the ILO is
exploring ways in which some long-time refugee populations can gain access to certain national social protection programmes, such as health insurance and essential
services, with budgetary support from the international
community.
6.3.2 Effective social protection coverage

Overview of national social security systems
Only a few countries in the Arab States, such as Jordan,
have developed coherent national social protection
policies. In most countries social protection remains
fragmented, relying on a variety of tools such as public
employment and social insurance for a few in formal
employment, and subsidies and safety nets for those

without formal employment contracts (see tables 6.1
and 6.2). Also, in most countries of the region the range
of social insurance benefits is limited to old-age, disability and survivors’ pensions, as well as employment injury
benefits, while only Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia have unemployment insurance schemes in place.
In addition, most countries have no maternity insurance schemes, and the responsibility for paying women’s
salaries during maternity leave rests with the employer.
Entitlements to cash benefits for sickness or family allowances are even less common. Most Arab countries
also lack effective health protection mechanisms; as a
result, catastrophic health expenditure remains a critical
factor contributing to vulnerability and poverty.
Many countries in the region offer some kind of
tax-financed social assistance programmes, but these
programmes are not rights-based and thus benefits are
granted on a discretionary basis, as opposed to being
based on clear rights and entitlements. Another issue
for these social assistance programmes is their funding,
which is often decided on an ad hoc basis, creating a

high level of insecurity for institutions and beneficiaries
alike. Finally, austerity measures in most non-GCC
(Gulf Cooperation Council) countries force governments to reduce or cut social subsidies. The savings
from these subsidy cuts, however, are not redirected to
strengthen social protection measures; as a result, they
are contributing to greater vulnerability and poverty.

Old-age, disability and survivors’ benefits
With most programmes dating back to the 1960s and
1970s, all countries in the region have at least one mandatory social insurance scheme established to provide
income security in old age, or in case of disability or
death (see also table 6.1 above), typically limited to
those working in the public sector (e.g. civil servants,
teachers, judges, military and security personnel) and
those working in the formal private sector on regular
contracts. Lebanon is the only country in the region
without a pension scheme for private sector workers.

The Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) adopted its
first ever old-age, disability and survivors’ pension legislation for private sector workers in 2016 (see box 6.12)
and is currently setting up an independent social security institution for the implementation of this new
pension scheme.
The statutory pensionable age hovers around a relatively young age of 60 years, compared to other regions,
and is often lower for women. The age for early retirement pensions in the Arab States is also far below the
world average: in many countries workers can retire as
early as age 45, with at least 20 years of contributions.
The majority of these schemes are financed by social
insurance contributions paid by workers and employers
as a fixed percentage of employees’ salaries, and in some
cases with additional support from the state budget.
Contributions range from 14 per cent of workers’
monthly earnings in Iraq to 21.1 per cent in the Syrian
Arab Republic.
In line with the implicit social contract between
citizens and the State, and given the large number
of young contributors and few pensioners, pension
schemes in the region provide rather generous retirement conditions and benefit levels. For example, the
replacement rates of old-age, disability and survivors’
pensions vary between countries due to difference
in accrual rates (e.g. 2 per cent per year of service in
Bahrain and 5 per cent per year of service in Qatar).
Maximum pensions are paid up to 100 per cent of
former earnings, as in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian
Arab Republic and Yemen (table 6.3). Also, entitlement conditions are rather generous. Both, however,
have proved unsustainable over time and several countries (e.g. Jordan) have already embarked on a reform of
their pension schemes.
As the mandatory pension schemes of the region
are limited to formal sector workers, they leave out
many categories of workers, such as temporary or
casual workers, informal workers, agricultural workers,

domestic workers, migrant workers, and large segments
of the self-employed. Only a few countries, such as Bahrain, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, make it possible for
self-employed workers to participate voluntarily in the
statutory pension scheme. While pension coverage in
the GCC countries is restricted to national workers,
citizens of one GCC country working in another GCC
country are mandatorily covered by the social security
legislation of their home country.
The limitations of the pension schemes of the
region are also reflected in the low regional legal coverage rate amounting to 31.4 per cent of the labour
force (see figure 6.19). The low rate also ref lects a
significant gender gap in social protection coverage that can be observed in the labour markets of
the region, with coverage rates for women often just

half of those for men, or even lower. Rising informal
employment as well as high youth unemployment
rates – the highest regional average in the world at
more than 31 per cent – also contribute to low pension coverage. Young women are even more penalized, as their labour force participation rate amounts
to only 13.5 per cent, while their unemployment rate
stands at 49 per cent.6
Jordan and Saudi Arabia have the highest pension
coverage of their labour force, at 52 and 50 per cent
respectively, while other GCC countries have considerably lower coverage rates due to the high numbers
of foreign workers, mainly from Southern Asia and
South-Eastern Asia, who do not enjoy social security
coverage and have to leave the country when their work
permit expires. This is also reflected by the higher percentage of pension beneficiaries above statutory retirement age compared to the percentage of contributors
in GCC countries (figure 6.20). Closing the coverage
gaps for migrant workers thus remains a significant
challenge in GCC countries where migrant workers
make up the majority of the population. One of the
countries where pension coverage has increased during
the last few years is the Syrian Arab Republic, as social
security is recognized in times of conflict as a reliable
source for providing income security.

Estimates from ILO, Trends Econometric Models, November 2016.

Non-contributory or social pensions are rare in
the region. Existing non-contributory cash benefits
for older persons, provided by governments or NGOs,
are often not based on clear rights and entitlements
but provided on a discretionary basis. Due to lack
of coordination and effective management information systems, some people may have duplicate coverage and others might lack coverage. In addition, these
schemes are usually dependent on government budgets, thus frequently leaving those most in need without
adequate protection. One notable exception is Iraq,
which in 2014 introduced a social assistance scheme
for older citizens with limited incomes and no access to
another form of pension. Combined with its social insurance, the scheme has helped to increase the effective
coverage rate for older persons receiving some form of
pension. Similar schemes elsewhere could help reduce
the gender gap in pension coverage by supplementing or substituting for lopsided social insurance entitlements. However, attention should also be paid to
benefit levels, which are often considerably lower in
social assistance programmes than in social insurance
schemes.

Employment injury protection
Most countries in the region have social insurance
schemes, which cover risks associated with work-related
accident and illness. Employers are responsible for contributing to mandatory employment injury schemes,
with contribution rates typically ranging from 1 to
4 per cent of workers’ monthly earnings. Some countries, such as Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar and United Arab
Emirates, still rely on employer liability provisions as
the basis for employment injury protection. As all GCC
countries except Oman provide employment injury coverage either through their statutory social insurance
scheme or through employers’ liability schemes not only
to national workers but also to their foreign workforce,
coverage is relatively high, ranging from 80 to more
than 90 per cent. In contrast, elsewhere in the region
less than half the workforce is legally covered, mainly
due to the high number of self-employed and informal
sector workers (table 6.4).
While some form of employment injury protection
exists in all countries, actual access to it is often elusive,
owing largely to incomplete enforcement of existing
labour legislation.

Unemployment protection

144

Despite rapid economic growth over the past decade,
the aggregate unemployment rate for the Arab States
region is one of the highest worldwide at more than
10 per cent, and unemployment is even much higher
among the youth population, at 31 per cent.7 This challenge became more apparent following the global financial crisis and the drop in oil prices; coupled with
the social unrest associated with the uprisings, it has
prompted several countries in the region to introduce
a range of social and economic policies, including unemployment insurance and assistance benefits, aimed at
providing income security for workers during periods
of unemployment and economic downturn. While
Bahrain was the only one to establish a mandatory unemployment insurance scheme for the involuntarily unemployed looking for a job in 2006, Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia followed suit in 2013 and 2014 respectively, and
Oman and the United Arab Emirates are in the process of setting up such schemes for their private sector
workers. Jordan introduced an unemployment individual savings account scheme in 2010, which however is
not based on solidarity and risk-pooling.
The few existing unemployment insurance schemes
are financed by shared employers’ and employees’ contributions, which range between 1.5 and 3 per cent of
employees’ salaries. Unemployment benefits are mostly
paid for a period of up to six months at a rate of 60 per
cent of the employee’s last salary. Entitlement conditions to the benefit vary, but in all cases the unemployed
person must have contributed to the scheme for a certain period, be registered at an employment office, and
be capable of and available for work.
While legal coverage levels in some countries are
high, in practice effective coverage rates are much
lower. In Bahrain, for example, just 9.8 per cent of
the unemployed are receiving benefits from the social
insurance scheme. In many cases, those who are
7

self-employed, non-nationals or non-residents are not
eligible for benefits, or experience limitations to their
participation in the scheme. In some countries unemployed workers are also losing their entitlement to
benefits due to the practice of forced resignation or for
political reasons.
Furthermore, the persistently high youth unemployment rates in the region, particularly for young women,
suggest that economic expansion is not sufficient to solve
the youth unemployment challenge. Among the range
of policies that have been introduced, in particular by
GCC countries, are unemployment assistance schemes
which, coupled with skills development, aim to assist
first-time jobseekers to enter the labour market. However, some of the schemes have run into controversy, as
some of these jobseekers who are paid the benefit subsequently never work (Jones and Williamson, 2013).

Maternity protection
In the Arab States, maternity cash benefits are available mainly for workers in the public sector. While
practically all Arab countries have experienced a remarkable increase in female labour force participation
during the last two decades, women tend to be employed in the public sector, due to more favourable
employment conditions. Leaving aside other differences in employment conditions between the public
and private sectors in areas such as pay, hours of work
and intensity of work, an important aspect is the relatively generous maternity benefits available to women
in the public sector.
While most countries worldwide have included maternity provisions in their social insurance schemes, most
countries in the Middle East provide for paid maternity
leave as an employer liability in their labour codes. Such
arrangements may inadvertently discourage the hiring
of female workers, however, thereby contributing to the

6. Monitoring progress in social protection: Regional trends

Box 6.12 Extending social security in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT)
Only public sector workers (31 per cent of the labour
force) benefit today from social protection benefits in
the OPT, home to 4.8 million Palestinians. However,
the majority of workers in the private sector (53 per
cent of the workforce) are effectively not covered in
case of old age, disability or death, employment injury or maternity.
With support from the ILO, the framework of the
current social security system was developed in 2013
by the tripartite National Social Security Committee
headed by the Prime Minister, and in consultation
with workers’ and employers’ organizations and representatives of line ministries, as well as members of
civil society and academia. Taking into account the
existing laws (Civil Servant Pension Scheme (Law
of Public Retirement No. 7 of 2005), Labour Law
No. 7 of 2000), as well as the ILO Social Security
(Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102)
and international good practices, this framework aims
at a more effective approach to combating poverty
and social exclusion, while ensuring sustainability,
building on an ILO actuarial valuation.
In October 2015 the tripartite National Social
Security Committee finalized the new draft of
the Social Security Law, which was submitted in
November 2015 to the Council of Ministers for adoption. Between October 2015 and March 2016, the
Council of Ministers and President of the OPT introduced amendments to a new draft Social Security Law,
adopted in March 2016. However, these amendments
were not fully supported by Palestinian civil society or
aligned with the ILO recommendations. Subsequently,
a Ministerial Committee was established to study the
effects of the amendments introduced to the new law,

hold wider consultations and propose alternative provisions based on national consensus and with technical support from the ILO. On 26 September 2016,
the Council of Ministers endorsed the amendments to
the Social Security Law, which were in line with ILO
recommendations, international labour standards and
best practices, and they were signed into law by the
Palestinian President on 29 September 2016. The
new scheme extends old-age, disability and death
benefits, as well as employment injury and maternity
benefits, to private sector workers and their family
members. It aims to cover 82,646 workers in 2018,
rising to 336,440 workers by 2025.
The OPT and the ILO signed an Implementation
Agreement to support the establishment of the
Palestinian Social Security Corporation (PSSC). The
PSSC is legally charged by the new Social Security
Law No. 19 of 2016 to administer the OPT’s first
comprehensive social security system to cover all
private sector workers and their family members.
Social protection is one of the key areas of the
newly adopted Palestinian National Policy Agenda
for the ye ars 2017–22 and the for thcoming
ILO Decent Work Programme for the Occupied
Palestinian Territory (2017–20), which lays down as
one of its priorities the extension of social protection
to all those in need in the OPT. Social protection is
also among one of the six identified priorities of the
United Nations Development Agreement Framework
(UNDAF) of the OPT, which aims to alleviate the social and economic impact of the occupation. Social
protection programmes have proved to be key in developing countries’ efforts to reduce poverty and inequality, fight hunger and support inclusive growth.

low labour market participation among women – 26 per
cent relative to a global average of 56 per cent of the
labour force. Even where legal or regulatory frameworks
are in place, effective access to maternity benefits may be
limited in practice, particularly where women encounter obstacles to being protected under employer liability
schemes without state guarantees.
Several countries, namely Iraq and Jordan, as well as
the OPT (see box 6.12), have moved toward social insurance schemes where contributions are made by employers for male and female employees to finance statutory
maternity insurance schemes, distributing risk more
evenly so that the cost of maternity is “socialized” and
is no longer a direct cost to individual employers. This
approach removes some of the obstacles to the employment of women in the private sector, thereby enhancing women’s employment opportunities and reducing
the duality between employment in the public and the

private sectors, contributing to economic growth and
raising income security for women and their families.
In Jordan, the shift from an employer liability scheme
to the maternity insurance scheme may have contributed to a rise in the number of women of childbearing
age in the formal private sector workforce by more than
30 per cent (ILO, 2015e).
6.3.3 Trends in social protection expenditure,
excluding health
According to the latest available data, countries in
the Arab States region spend on average 2.5 per cent
of GDP on social protection, excluding health (see
figure 6.21), though with significant regional variation,
ranging from around 0.4 per cent of GDP in the Syrian
Arab Republic to 9.2 per cent in Kuwait. Considered

low, social protection expenditure in the region is partly
the result of a long-prevailing development model
which places absolute priority on economic growth in
detriment to redistributive policies. The Arab States
maintain a relatively large public sector as part of the
social contract between the State and the people.
Instabilities in the region have affected public social
security and health expenditure, mainly in the Syrian
Arab Republic, where it dropped from 3.2 per cent in
2000 to 1.9 per cent in 2010. Lebanon has been affected as well, with an overall decrease in expenditure
rates from 3.2 per cent in 1995 to 2.1 per cent in 2015,
and a drastic cut to 0.7 per cent in 2012 at the peak of

the Syrian crisis and the influx of refugees to Lebanon.
Oman saw a slight increase in expenditure on social security and health, from 3.7 per cent in 1995 to 3.8 per
cent in 2013.
A striking increase in expenditure has taken place in
Yemen, where the total public social security and health
expenditure was 1.4 per cent in 2000 and reached
9.6 per cent in 2012. In Bahrain the expenditure is on
a slight rise: from 3.6 per cent in 2015, it is expected to
reach 4.0 per cent within five years. As for Jordan, the
fluctuation of the expenditure percentage in the past
20 years led to 8.9 per cent of GDP being spent on total
public social security and health expenditure. Kuwait
too experienced variation in the expenditure percentage
on public social security: from 11.1 per cent in 1995, it
fell to 6.5 per cent within a ten-year period but then
rose again to 11.4 per cent in 2011.
It is however difficult to have a clear picture on the
composition of social protection expenditure in the
Arab States, due to limited data (see figure 6.22).
While the majority of governments scaled up social
protection interventions as a first reaction to the financial and economic crisis in 2008, and during the Arab
Spring, a more recent wave of reactions, this time influenced by the pressure from the international financial organizations, has focused on fiscal consolidation,
threatening some of the progress achieved in the past
decade and creating additional challenges for the expansion of social protection. Subsidy reform is the key adjustment measure in the region, as countries are under
pressure to reform their energy and, in some cases, food
and other subsidies. Jordan, Lebanon and Yemen (prior

to the conflict) were considering a reduction in energy
subsidies; Jordan also has substantial food subsidy programmes which are a key component of social protection systems and are now under discussion for reform.
Other common adjustment measures include wage bill
cuts/caps and labour market reforms. Joblessness is high
in the region and the public sector tends to be the largest employer, so reducing the wage bill is likely to have
negative social impacts (Ortiz et al., 2015).
6.3.4 Regional outlook
Social protection systems in the Arab States remain in
need of strategic reforms to extend coverage. Since the
1990s, economic reforms in the region have left social
protection as a secondary priority, with limited impact,
prioritizing fiscal consolidation and budgetary considerations while failing to ensure income security and
satisfy Arab aspirations. A clear and ambitious vision
is required to overcome the prevailing social protection
deficits. This vision should follow a universal but progressive approach and must be accepted by societies – an
outcome best achieved through social dialogue. Several
conditions are required to turn this vision into reality:
• Countries should focus on the development of comprehensive social protection systems, inclusive of
social protection floors for all, following a rightsbased approach; comprehensiveness includes the extension of personal coverage and at the same time
encompasses the widening of the range of benefits
so as to guarantee their adequacy for a life in decency and dignity.
• The aggregate level of public expenditure in social
protection needs to be significantly increased
through, for example, reallocation of public expenditure or increased revenues from improved tax
income and/or from social insurance contributions;
experience shows that social and political choices
and political will play a central role in these decisions, as evidenced by the fact that countries with
similar levels of economic development have significantly different levels of investment in social
protection.
• Contributory schemes need to be better adapted
to labour market characteristics, particularly to the
high number of workers in non-standard forms of
employment and informal employment; this adaptation calls for innovative policies, but also for joint
efforts from social security administrations and

labour inspectorates to improve the enforcement of
laws and compliance.
• Synergies between contributory and non-contributory schemes need to be strengthened through the
development of innovative policy solutions.
• Reforms need to ensure a fair balance between sustainability and adequacy, despite the increasing
pressure for governments to introduce fiscal consolidation measures.
• The design of social protection systems needs to acknowledge the specific challenges faced by women
in the labour market; systems should be designed so
as to take these into account, particularly for those
in informal and vulnerable employment.
• National legislations must ensure equal treatment
of national and migrant workers; countries should
develop bilateral and/or multilateral social security
agreements for the maintenance of migrant workers’
social security rights.
• For the countries in crisis situations, humanitarian
and development responses need to strengthen investment in social protection, in particular national social
protection floors, so as to mitigate the worst effects of
the crisis, to promote sustainable development and to
strengthen institutional capacities. In particular, with
support from the international community, sustainable solutions need to be found to guarantee a certain
level of income security and access to basic social services for forcibly displaced populations.
• Developments in national policies and legal frameworks should be complemented by improvements in
scheme management and administration and by the
provision of quality services, including at decentralized levels.

6.4 Asia and the Pacific
6.4.1 Regional social protection challenges
and priorities
High levels of economic growth, coupled with significant poverty reduction, have underscored recent
decades in the Asia and Pacific region. Despite this progress, 1.2 billion people in Asia and the Pacific are still
below the poverty line of US$3.10 (2011 PPP) a day,
inequalities within and across countries are widening,
and one in ten workers lives in extreme poverty (below

147

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

148

US$1.90/day). The decades-long development model
dominating the region prioritized economic growth at
the expense of redistributive policies. This has reduced
the fiscal space for social expenditure (Holliday, 2000);
consequently, a large share of the population was denied
the right to social protection.
The socio-economic impact of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, as well as the 2008–09 global crisis and later
recession, revealed the limitations of this developmental
model. Asian countries discovered that inadequate and
underdeveloped social protection systems had exposed
their populations to excessive vulnerabilities and undermined longer-term human capital investments. In
response, social protection has gained momentum in
the regional development agenda, with several countries
seeing it as an important pillar of their renewed inclusive growth models and taking concrete measures to
extend social protection to all (see box 6.13). There is an
emerging consensus on the positive link between social
protection and inclusive economic growth from the
point of view of the developmental role of the State in
enhancing employability and stimulating the economy
(Koehler, 2011; ESCAP, 2015).
Despite regional diversity, the general trend across
the region is positive, with several countries creating
new schemes or significantly extending the coverage
of existing schemes. The rapid extension of legal social
protection coverage, especially to the self-employed and
workers in the informal economy, together with the
effective introduction of contributory and non-contributory schemes for these workers and their families, have
been crucial features of this trend.
Notwithstanding the world recession, growth is projected to reach 5.5 per cent in 2017 and 5.4 per cent in
2018 in the Asia and Pacific region (IMF, 2017c). The
longer-term challenge lies in sustaining rapid growth
while ensuring greater inclusion, reducing precariousness of employment, increasing productivity and addressing the consequences of rapid population ageing.
Employment is becoming increasingly precarious, with a
rise in non-standard forms of employment – temporary,
part-time, despatch or contract labour (ILO, 2016m).
Informal employment remains high, especially in
South-Eastern Asia and Oceania and in Southern Asia,
where it reached 54.1 and 73.6 per cent respectively in
2015 (ILO, 2016n). These informal economy workers
have no or only very limited access to basic social security coverage. In many countries in Asia, social protection benefits accrue to those working in the formal

Box 6.13 ASEAN’s commitment to extend
social protection to all
The 2008–09 financial and economic crisis highlighted the role of social protection in mitigating the
risks of unfettered markets and preserving economic
and social stability in crunch periods. Between
2009 and 2012, a number of global fora advocated
for expanding social protection, including the United
Nations, the G20, and the 101th International Labour
Conference, which adopted Recommendation No. 202.
The Member States of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) were no different. During the
same period, as part of ASEAN’s regional integration
process, they advocated for improved social protection and progressive extension of coverage to all
following a life-cycle approach. In 2013, during its
23rd Summit in Brunei Darussalam, this led to the
adoption of the ASEAN Declaration on Strengthening
Social Protection by the ten ASEAN Heads of State,
pledging the completion of social protection floors as
a priority to achieve growth with equity.
Committed to actualizing this Declaration, in 2015
the Member States agreed on a Regional Framework
and Plan of Action for the Implementation. Increased
social protection is also a core priority of the 2016–20
Senior Labour Officials Meeting’s Work Programme.
Currently the Member States are defining a monitoring
framework to measure progress in extending social
protection, using relevant SDG targets and indicators.
This instrument will be used to gauge compliance of
the Member States with the 2013 Declaration.
In this context, over the past six years the ASEAN
Member States, via the ASEAN Secretariat, have
enhanced their collaboration on social protection
with the support of the ILO. In particular, ASEAN
has requested the ILO’s expertise and reference to
its standards for policy-oriented research on topics
such as current and future trends of pension systems, social protection of migrant workers, the
challenges of extending coverage to workers in the
informal economy, financing social protection and
monitoring social protection progresses.

and ADB, 2014; Ong and Peyron Bista, 2015, based on
documents released by the ASEAN Secretariat.

assistance. A large number of households (the so-called
missing middle) are covered by neither social insurance
nor social assistance. This missing middle usually works
in the informal economy, and is a vulnerable group in
urgent need of social protection support (ADB, 2013;
Samson and Kenny, 2016; Wening Handayani, 2016).
Ageing has become a main issue in the region
(box 6.14). Contrary to the developed economies in
Europe or North America, most countries in Asia and
the Pacific are ageing before instating robust social
protection systems. This puts additional pressure on

6. Monitoring progress in social protection: Regional trends

Box 6.14 Ageing in Asia
Rising living standards, including better nutrition, sanitation, health care and education, have dramatically
increased life expectancy in the region. In the half
century since 1960, life expectancy in Asia and the
Pacific has increased by nearly 30 years, almost double
the increase in European life expectancy in the same
period. While longer lives are undoubtedly a positive
development, since this is not matched by a concurrent increase in fertility, Asian countries are ageing at a
historically unprecedented rate. Where OECD countries
took 50–100 years to transition from young to old societies, Asian countries are taking just 20–25 years (World
Bank, 2016c). In fact, for some countries, such as Japan
and the Republic of Korea, ageing poses significant
challenges. One-fourth of Japan’s population is already
elderly. This is only projected to increase, with many
more entering the oldest (90 years and older) category
where health-care expenditure sees a sharp increase.
Viet Nam is also among the rapidly ageing countries:
life expectancy in 1990 was 70.4 years, rising to 75.6
in 2014. As a direct consequence, in 2008 there were
8.9 million people of pensionable age, and the number
is expected to reach 21 million by 2030. Many countries
have aged faster than they have become wealthy. Even
countries like Bangladesh and Lao People’s Democratic
Republic (Lao PDR), which currently have a burgeoning
youth population capable of yielding a significant demographic dividend in the coming years, will not be

immune from the ageing crisis. By the end of this century, Lao PDR’s old-age dependency ratio, for example,
is expected to rise sixfold (ILO, 2015f).
Already, the elderly poverty rate in the Republic of
Korea is the highest among OECD countries, nearly ten
times that of Spain which has a similar GDP per capita.
In Asia, where informality is a significant marker of the
labour market, this has tested the limits of contributory
models of financing social protection. The popularity of
tax-based financing has thus risen, especially in health
care. Asian governments will benefit from pursuing active labour market policies that boost productivity and
improve female labour force participation, adjusting social protection systems, especially pensions and health
care, and introducing new long-term care guarantees, to
address the new pressures they face.
A useful strategy that is already being deployed, albeit
sporadically, is heightened labour mobility. Intra-ASEAN
migration rose nearly fourfold in the last two decades
(ILO and ADB, 2014). By harnessing the benefits of regional migration – which provides a ready labour supply
and a capacity to contribute to social security – the
countries with older populations can offset the pressure
that ageing poses on their social security systems. Also,
given that developing countries are ageing as well, immigration itself will not be a total panacea. Policy-makers
will thus need to show considerable innovation and flexibility in addressing the multifaceted challenges of ageing.

families as well as additional financial strain on the
pension systems. In several countries immigration already plays an important role in softening the impact
of ageing.
Gender gaps in employment persist, as shown by the
low participation rates for women compared to men
(ILO, 2016n). In addition, women are more represented
in vulnerable forms of work, particularly unpaid family
work, which accounts for nearly one in five females employed in Asia and the Pacific (ILO, 2016m).
Although several countries have made some progress
in achieving a basic level of income security and medical
care for all citizens, decision-makers face several crucial
challenges, such as closing the coverage gap, improving
governance of social protection schemes, and creating
the necessary fiscal space for social protection policies.
Migrant workers working in the formal sector are
legally covered by existing national social security systems, but may face challenges in exercising their rights
to benefits, particularly in the case of old-age pensions.
The majority of migrant workers, confined in lowskilled and low-paid jobs in the informal sector, are
still excluded from national schemes in the countries of

destination. Some countries (such as Indonesia, Philippines and Sri Lanka) have developed specific schemes
to cover their nationals while they are working abroad.
6.4.2 Effective social protection coverage:
Monitoring SDG indicator 1.3.1
in Asia and the Pacific
In Asia and the Pacific, 38.9 per cent of the total population has effective access to at least one area of social
protection (see figure 6.23). One of the most notable
characteristics of the region is a dispersion in the current state of social protection coverage. The difference
in coverage between Australia and India, the highest
and lowest, is more than 70 percentage points. The
region includes countries that are still in the early stages
of building their social protection systems, and countries that already have comprehensive systems in place
(ILO, 2016n), hence displaying higher levels of coverage. Examples of the latter include Australia, Japan, the
Republic of Korea and New Zealand, where the share
of population covered for at least one contingency is

above 65 per cent. This situation is not exclusive to developed economies, though: China, Mongolia, Thailand and Viet Nam also have “comprehensive” 8 systems
in place. Mongolia and China cover 72 and 63 per cent
of their populations respectively in at least one area of
social protection. Some of these countries are global
references, due to the speed with which they have put
in place programmes with universal coverage, such as
universal pensions and health in China and Thailand,
and universal child benefits in Mongolia.
At the opposite end of the spectrum are countries
like India, where so far only 19 per cent of the population is covered for at least one contingency, or Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, where less than a third of the
population is covered for at least one contingency.

Child and family benefits
Social protection coverage for children in the region
is relatively low. However, some countries, such as
Australia and Mongolia, stand out as offering universal social protection coverage (see figure 6.24).9 Other
countries, such as Indonesia, Philippines and TimorLeste, have established conditional cash transfer programmes targeting families with children, but coverage
levels are relatively low: in the Philippines, coverage is a
mere 14 per cent.
Thailand combines a child allowance as part of
social insurance with the more recently introduced
Child Support Grant, a non-contributory means-tested
monetary transfer to families with children up to three
years of age. In countries such as Lao PDR or Cambodia, cash benefits for families with children are still
limited to some small-scale pilots, despite their positive
developmental impacts. Several countries in the region
do not provide for any family or child benefits anchored
in legislation. Fiscal consolidation pressures have also
questioned Mongolia’s universal child allowance but
the most recent decision from the Government is to
keep universal eligibility (see box 2.2).

6. Monitoring progress in social protection: Regional trends

Maternity protection
Social protection for maternity remains a challenge
(figure 6.25). On average, countries in the region cover
only one-third of women giving birth for cash maternity benefits. More remarkably, some of the countries
with high fertility rates face a significant gap to close
by 2030. Women in Bangladesh and the Philippines
give birth two to three times during their lives,10 but
only 21, respectively 9 per cent of women giving birth in
a given year receive maternity benefits. Mongolia is the
region’s only country with universal maternity protection. Myanmar and the Philippines are two of the countries where the coverage is below 10 per cent. Low levels
of coverage are found in countries where maternity protection is limited to workers in the formal economy.
Some countries have been extending social protection coverage to women in the informal sector through
cash transfers at the time of pregnancy and birth. This is
the case of the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana
in India, or the Maternal and Child Cash Transfer in
Myanmar. The latter was launched by the Myanmar
Government in 2017 and aims to gradually become a
universal transfer for pregnant women and children up
to two years old.
In a number of countries, maternity protection remains the sole responsibility of employers, who finance

The percentage of the unemployed that benefit from
unemployment cash benefits is still relatively low when
compared to other contingencies. This situation can in
part be explained by the fact that many countries in the
region have not prioritized the launch of unemployment benefits – a large number of them still make this
an employer liability through the use of severance payments upon termination of employment. This is the
case for Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Pakistan, Singapore and Sri Lanka.
Unlike for other contingencies, higher-income
countries do not necessarily show a significantly higher
coverage of unemployment benefits (see figure 6.26).

Unemployment cash benefits are mostly limited to
wage workers in the formal economy which, in a region
with high predominance of informal employment, affects coverage levels. Some countries, particularly in
Southern Asia, have opted to set up minimum employment guarantee schemes. This is the case of Bangladesh,
India and Nepal, which have established the right to a
minimum number of days of employment, especially in
rural areas.
Although unemployment benefits are one of the less
established social security areas in the region, the introduction of unemployment insurance schemes is gaining
momentum, with several countries, such as Indonesia,
Malaysia, Nepal and the Philippines, currently involved
in national dialogue on the design of such schemes
(ILO, 2016n).

Disability benefits
Effective coverage for disability benefits is highly diverse across the region, with Australia and Mongolia
achieving 100 per cent coverage of persons with severe
disabilities, New Zealand 80 per cent and Japan 56 per
cent. However, in Cambodia, India, Myanmar, the

action?ressource.ressourceId=54705

Philippines and Viet Nam, fewer than one in ten persons with severe disabilities are covered (see figure 6.27).

Old-age pensions
Old age is one of the contingencies with higher coverage in the region, yet the numbers hide significant
disparities between countries. China (see box 6.15 and
figure 6.28), Japan, Maldives, Mongolia, New Zealand
and Timor-Leste provide universal coverage. Australia,
Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong (China), Republic of
Korea and Thailand have coverage levels above 70 per
cent and are moving towards universal coverage. On
the other hand, in countries such as Bhutan, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Pakistan or Vanuatu, effective coverage
remains below 6 per cent of their old-age population
(see figure 6.29).
Countries that have reached broad coverage levels
have usually established tax-funded schemes (or social
pensions) to extend coverage rapidly to populations
with low contributory capacity. There is a gradual
but positive trend in the region in the implementation of social pensions. Even countries with less developed social protection systems are exploring the
launch of tax-based universal pensions. This is the case
of  ­Kiribati, Myanmar, Nepal, Samoa, Timor-Leste and
Viet Nam. Some of these countries opted for a gradual approach by starting with higher eligibility ages (in
­Myanmar the qualifying age is 90 and in Nepal it is 70),
with the plan to gradually extend the coverage to lower
age cohorts. In Viet Nam a universal social pension
scheme covers all older persons above 80 years of age;
the pension is means-tested for those aged 60–79 years.
Other elements that deserve to be highlighted are
the solutions that some countries have put in place to
integrate under the same scheme a contributory and
tax-based approach, particularly when it comes to ensuring the income security of those in the rural and informal economy.
With regard to contributory schemes, the region
also displays heterogeneity. In general, defined benefit
schemes prevail (as in the Republic of Korea, Thailand
and Viet Nam), but in a small number of countries the
main component of the system is a form of defined contribution scheme organized under national provident
funds (as in Fiji, India, Malaysia and Singapore), an old
legacy from colonial times.

6. Monitoring progress in social protection: Regional trends

Box 6.15 Universal pensions in China
made available to those already above retirement
age (over 60), even if they were not able to reach
the contributions required. They could get coverage
through one of two processes: they could make
lump-sum contributions to make up for any shortfall
for the vesting requirement of 15 years of contributions (World Bank, 2016c), or, if they had children,
they could avail themselves of a “family-binding”
policy that allows those with no contributions to receive the flat-rate pension as long as their workingage children contribute to the pension system. The
relatively low level of minimum contribution required, together with the fact that contributors can
choose their own level of contributions, also makes
the scheme attractive. For an annual contribution of
a minimum of RMB 100 per year, a working adult
is contributing to her/his own pension in the future,
while at the same time immediately guaranteeing
that her/his parents benefit from a pension of at
least RMB 70 per month. In addition, the local government is required to match part of the contribution, thereby increasing the pension.
Figure 6.28 China: Expansion of old-age pension
coverage, 2001–13
900
Number of people covered (in millions)

China is a particularly interesting case of how
political will, in conjunction with innovation, can
produce extremely fast processes of coverage
extension, even to groups with low contributory
capacity. Between 2009 and 2013, China tripled
the number of people covered by the old-age pension system, making impressive progress towards
its goal of achieving universal coverage by 2020.
The current state pension system comprises three
schemes: (1) pension scheme for urban workers;
(2) pension scheme for civil servants and government employees; and (3) pension scheme for rural
and urban residents not covered under the first two.
A critical innovation was the use of labour inspection to increase compliance and therefore extend
effective coverage. Based on unified information
systems for labour inspection and social security,
labour inspection services were able to ensure that
companies, whatever their size, have their workers
registered in the social security system.
Another innovation was the pension scheme for
rural and urban residents. It has two components:
(i) a solidarity component, a basic pension in the
form of a basic flat-rate benefit that is entirely financed by the Government; and (ii) an individual
pension component, financed by contributions
of the insured and supplemented by government
subsidies. Members contribute annually to the account, choosing voluntarily from different levels of
annual contribution rates ranging from RMB 100
to a maximum of RMB 2,000. The initial value of
the basic pension under the scheme is RMB 70 per
month, supplemented by the individual pension
component and possibly topped up by local governments at their discretion from their own revenues.
Participation in the system is voluntary, and residents become eligible for the pension after 15 years
of contribution to the system.
So how did the scheme expand so fast? By fully
subsidizing the flat-rate benefit, the Government
assumed a large share of the cost of the benefit,
making it more attractive to potential contributors.
A key innovation was that this flat-rate benefit was

Social assistance
In view of the relatively limited social insurance coverage in many Asian countries, social assistance benefits
potentially play an important role in protecting those
who are not covered by contributory mechanisms and
are therefore vulnerable to social risks. Yet social assistance coverage for vulnerable populations is uneven
across the region (figure 6.30). Australia delivers social
assistance benefits to the largest proportion of vulnerable populations (53 per cent), followed by Mongolia

(35 per cent). Bangladesh, with the lowest coverage
(4 per cent), and the rest of the countries leave more
than two-thirds of vulnerable populations without
access to any social assistance benefits. Extending social
protection floors is a critical priority for the region.

The level of social protection expenditure varies markedly between countries in the region, ranging from
15.2 per cent of GDP for Japan to 0.1 per cent for
Bhutan (see figure 6.31). Following Japan, Australia and
New Zealand, with 12.4 and 10.3 per cent respectively,
are the two other countries with relatively higher levels
of expenditure. This is in contrast to countries such as
Brunei Darussalam (0.2 per cent), Lao PDR (0.2 per
cent) and Bangladesh (0.9 per cent).
Although the mean social protection expenditure in
Asia and the Pacific is still as low as 7.4 per cent of GDP,
in general the regional trend in the recent past has been
positive. Indeed, the growing interest in social protection observed in recent decades in several countries has
resulted in greater public investment, with the majority of countries expanding the allocation of public resources to social protection. For instance, Thailand was
spending below 1 per cent of GDP in 2000, but by 2015
public expenditure on social protection was 3.7 per cent,
a more than threefold increase in 15 years. The major
increase took place between 2000 and 2012, when expenditure reached a peak of 4.4 per cent of GDP. China
is another example of a country with a significant positive trend. It almost doubled its expenditure in 20 years,

from 3.2 per cent of GDP dedicated to public social
protection expenditure in 1995 to 6.3 per cent in 2015.
Both countries constitute global examples of quick expansion of social protection coverage, particularly in the
area of social health protection and social protection coverage for older persons, providing close to universal coverage in both contingencies. Other countries that have
more than doubled their public expenditure in social
protection in the last 20 years are the Republic of Korea,
Nepal, Philippines, Singapore and Western Samoa.
The opposite trend has been observed in Brunei
Darussalam, Indonesia, Lao PDR and Pakistan, where
the percentage of GDP allocated to social protection
has been on a gradual decline since 2000 (ILO, 2016n).
Despite the reduced pace observed in recent years in
economic growth in the region, there has been no general
trend towards cuts in public social protection expenditure. This is probably because most of these countries
had relatively low expenditure levels to begin with.

However, other social expenditures, not included
in social security expenditures, have been cut in a
number of countries. The reduction of social subsidies
and cuts/caps to the public sector wage bill dominate
the list of austerity measures for Eastern Asia and Oceania. Subsidy reform is being considered in countries
such as Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand
and ­Timor-Leste. While energy subsidies are the main
focus, other reforms include cuts to crop subsidies for
farmers on remote islands in Kiribati and cuts to housing subsidies in the Philippines. In addition, 13 countries are considering cuts/caps to the public wage bill,
such as to civil servants, including those working in
social sectors (e.g. Lao PDR, Malaysia, most of the
Pacific islands, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam). Following
the standard set of adjustments occurring in countries undertaking fiscal consolidation (Ortiz et al.,
2015), Fiji, Indonesia, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau, among others,
are considering reforms to contributory pensions, and
Malaysia, Mongolia and Tuvalu are under pressure to
narrow-target their social protection schemes. Labour
market reforms are also on the agenda in at least five
countries in the region: Cambodia, China, Indonesia,
Timor-Leste and Tuvalu.
Traditionally, many Asian governments creatively
identified new sources of fiscal space to extend social
protection coverage and benefits. For example, Thailand
reallocated military expenditures for universal health,
Mongolia financed a universal child benefit from a tax
on mineral exports, and Indonesia extended social protection from a reform of energy subsidies (ILO, 2016p).
While a significant part of the extension of social protection in Asia is likely to result from contributions,
governments need to continue exploring new ways to
finance social assistance. A number of countries in the
region have significant reserves and still low levels of
taxation, which should be explored together with other
options to expand fiscal space, such as the elimination
of illicit financial flows (Ortiz et al., 2015), as part of developmental national dialogue processes.
With regard to the composition of social protection
expenditure, higher levels of expenditure are often associated with social protection for older persons. This is
the case for countries such as China, Japan, Myanmar,
Nepal, Palau, Thailand and Viet Nam. For these countries, the expenditure on older people is close to 50 per
cent of the total social protection expenditure.
In contrast, countries such as Australia, Indonesia
and Singapore present a more balanced distribution of
public expenditure (see figure 6.32).

6.4.4 Regional outlook
Looking at the existing regional social protection deficits and key challenges, it is clear that it will only be
possible to reach the objectives defined under the SDGs
if the countries in the Asia and the Pacific region intensify their efforts to extend social protection, with a particular focus on the following actions:
• Extend social protection to those in the informal
economy by a mix of contributory and non-contributory schemes with a view to achieving universal
coverage.
• Develop social protection f loors for those who
cannot work, such as children, mothers with newborns, persons with disabilities, older persons and
those who are poor and out of work.
• Increase the aggregate level of public expenditure
on social protection to extend social protection
coverage.
• Strengthen taxation systems for financing social
protection and explore innovative ways to expand
fiscal space for social protection.
• While extending coverage is the primary objective
in Asia, give attention also to benefit adequacy.

• Adapt the design and implementation of contributory schemes to the regional labour market
characteristics, including the preponderance of nonstandard forms of work.
• Promote innovative solutions, based on integrated
approaches that combine contributory and taxfunded schemes, that bring together concerns regarding the extension of coverage and the adequacy
of benefits.
• Invest substantially in the administration and management of schemes, including in the provision of
quality services at decentralized level.
• Accelerate progress towards achieving SDG
target 1.3 and related goals by prioritizing social
protection in the national development strategies.
• The way forward should include a reinforcement
of global knowledge exchanges and South–South
collaboration to ensure that countries can benefit
further from the wealth and diversity of global and
regional experiences.

6. Monitoring progress in social protection: Regional trends

6.5 Europe and Central Asia
6.5.1 Regional social protection challenges
and priorities
Social protection systems, including floors, are traditionally well established in the region and have
achieved high levels of coverage compared to other regions. However, there is significant variation in levels
of social protection expenditure, financing sources,
adequacy of benefits and the role of the social partners. Some countries, including most Member States
of the European Union, have mature and comprehensive social protection systems in place, typically comprised of well-established social insurance systems and
tax-financed universal social assistance schemes (European Commission, 2017a). In some countries, however,
fiscal consolidation measures may jeopardize the progress achieved. In other parts of the region, especially in
Central Asia, social protection systems face challenges
of limited coverage and inadequate benefit levels, alongside budget constraints and insufficient administrative
capacity, thus failing to lift people out of poverty and
informal employment (Gassmann, 2011).
Overall, national policy discussions reflect the fact
that social protection systems in the region are increasingly confronted with challenges of coverage, adequacy
and financial sustainability. The changing world of work
and population ageing are placing greater pressure on the
financial sustainability of social protection systems, and
on sustainable development as a whole. In particular,
the spread of non-standard forms of employment, including short hours, temporary contracts and low pay,
as well as the emergence of new forms of employment
(such as platform work) constitute a challenge for both
coverage and benefit levels, as many workers face significant coverage gaps at present and in the future (ILO,
2016b; Degryse, 2016). Young generations are under
particular pressure from demographic change and structural changes in the labour market, including the shift
to changing and non-standard forms of work, as well
as lasting effects of the global recession after the financial crisis. Reforms implemented thus far have left them
in a situation where they are likely to need to pay increasing contribution rates that will be required to fund
future expenditures on the growing number of pensioners; while on the other hand they may expect lower pension entitlements than today’s pensioners (European
Commission, 2017a). These possible outcomes need to
be addressed to ensure intergenerational fairness and
maintain social cohesion within the region.

Among these challenges are the inadequate benefit
levels in many countries which trap people in poverty,
even those engaged in employment (ILO, 2017f). For
example, child benefits in some countries in Central
and Eastern Europe are low, and thus have limited
impact on enhancing income security for families with
children (Bradshaw and Hirose, 2016). Moreover, although pension systems in many countries include a
universal social pension or a minimum pension, benefit
levels often fall below the poverty threshold and consequently fail to prevent poverty in old age (European
Commission, 2015c).
Some recent reforms have focused on strengthening social protection coverage for those who were
previously excluded or inadequately covered, such as
part-time workers or the self-employed (European
Commission, 2017b; ILO, 2016b). Other countries,
especially in Central Asia, have been rebuilding their
social protection systems since the 1990s’ transition to
market economies and are adapting them to current
circumstances, making significant efforts to close coverage gaps and strengthen the adequacy and sustainability of benefits (UNICEF, 2015b). Further efforts
need to be undertaken to build comprehensive social
protection systems.
A major debate in the region concerns old-age pensions. While many countries have achieved universal
social protection coverage for older persons, some face
sustainability and adequacy challenges. In the context
of fiscal consolidation, European governments have
made a number of changes to their public pension systems, such as the introduction of longer contribution
periods required for a full pension, the increase of the
statutory retirement age and its equalization for men
and women, and the decrease of benefit levels. Member
States of the European Union have prioritized measures to ensure the broad financial sustainability of pension systems, yet major concerns exist regarding the
adequacy of benefits (European Commission, 2015c,
2015d). For example, one concern is the adequacy of
prospective pension levels for women, considering their
shorter contribution periods on average and lower contribution levels (partly driven by persistent gender
wage gaps) throughout their life, as well as their higher
life expectancy. Also, as a result of parametric reforms
to public pension systems, future pensioners in many
European countries will receive lower pensions (ILO,
2014a), reducing the State’s responsibility for guaranteeing income security in old age.
In contrast, some countries in Eastern and Central
Europe have reversed the pension privatization reforms

157

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Box 6.16 The European social model, eroded by short-term adjustment reforms

158

Since 2010, fiscal consolidation or austerity policies
have focused on reforming pension and health entitlements to reduce the long-term financial obligations
of the State by way of avoiding “a rise in spending
as a share of GDP” (IMF, 2010a, p. 16; see also IMF,
2010b) and containing other spending, even though
adopting such policies was premature (ILO, 2014a).
While there is no single “European social model” in
a strict sense, this term has been used to describe
the collective experience of European welfare states,
embedded in a broader social contract, which contributed to economic growth and social progress particularly in the period after the Second World War.
In recent years, however, the European social model
has come under pressure; it has been depicted as
unaffordable and burdensome, ultimately reducing
competitiveness and discouraging growth. But adjustment measures have contributed to increases in
the poverty now affecting 86.8 million people in the
European Union and representing more than 17 per
cent of the population, many of them children,
women and persons with disabilities. The number of
children at risk of poverty or social exclusion stood
at 22.3 million in 2015, or 26.7 per cent of children
up to the age of 16. Some estimates foresee an
additional 15–25 million people facing the prospect
of living in poverty by 2025 if fiscal consolidation
continues (Oxfam, 2013). Higher poverty and inequality are the results not only of the severity of the
global recession and low employment rates, but also
of specific policy decisions targeting universal policies, curtailing social transfers and limiting access to
quality public services. The long-accepted concept

of universal access to decent living conditions for
all citizens has been threatened by a widening gulf
between more narrowly targeted programmes for
the poor and a stronger emphasis on individual savings for the middle- and upper-income groups. The
achievements of the European social model, which
dramatically reduced poverty and promoted prosperity in the period following the Second World War,
have been eroded since the crisis by short-term adjustment reforms.
The difficulties many Europeans face in attaining
and maintaining a decent standard of living, the
emergence of new and non-standard forms of informal employment and the preponderance of precarious and informal employment during the crisis,
have fuelled debates around the need to strengthen
Europe’s social dimension, focusing on the core question as to how governments will be able to create more
and better jobs and provide adequate social protection for all while ensuring fairness and social inclusion.
In this context, various efforts have been made to
develop new frameworks and innovative schemes,
both at national and European level. One example
is the European Pillar of Social Rights, launched in
2017. European policy coordination, however, continues to focus on growth and structural reforms
first, through mechanisms such as the EU Stability
and Growth Pact, the Macroeconomic Imbalance
Procedure and the European Semester (surveillance
missions initiated in 2009), sidelining social policies
and leaving the welfare of European populations as
a second priority, implementable at national level if
governments have sufficient funding.

of the 1990s and re-nationalized their pension schemes
fully or partially. In order to ensure their long-term sustainability, reform measures have been undertaken in
recent years. Greater emphasis is put on the contributory principle and benefit levels are more directly linked
to the contributions actually paid, thus giving rise to
concerns about benefit adequacy (Hirose and Hetteš,
2016). Some countries in Central Asia have begun to
introduce private pension schemes; for example, in 2014
Armenia introduced a funded pension system which is
mandatory for public sector workers but remains voluntary for those working in the private sector.

6.5.2 Effective social protection coverage:
Monitoring SDG indicator 1.3.1
in Europe and Central Asia
Compared to other regions, aggregate effective social
protection coverage (excluding health) in Europe and
Central Asia is relatively high, with 84 per cent of the
population covered (see figure 6.33). In many countries in
the region, particularly in Northern, Southern and Western Europe, comprehensive social protection systems are
in place to provide universal (or close-to-­universal) protection in at least one area other than health protection.
For example, in France, Kazakhstan and Sweden, the
entire population is covered by at least one social protection scheme. In other countries social protection coverage is incomplete; this is the case for example in Armenia,
Azerbaijan and Georgia, where less than half the population is covered for at least one social protection benefit.

Child and family benefits
While many countries in the region offer universal coverage for children, on average 88 per cent of all
children aged 0–14 have effective access to social protection benefits (see figure 6.34). Universal protection
is achieved in 21 countries through different means,
for example through universal schemes in Austria,
­E stonia and Finland, a combination of contributory
and non-contributory schemes in Belgium and the

Russian Federation, or non-contributory benefits in
­K azakhstan and Poland (see also figure 2.4). In contrast, effective coverage for child benefits is significantly
lower in A

have achieved high levels of effective coverage for maternity cash benefits. Maternity protection is one of the

the region. On average, 81 per cent of women in employment are covered by maternity cash benefit schemes
(see figure 6.35). The majority of countries, particularly
European Union Member States, provide maternity
cash benefits to all women in employment during maternity. Many countries have achieved universal coverage through social insurance schemes (for example
Austria, Belgium, Cyprus and Iceland), whereas others
(such as Croatia, Malta, Portugal and the United Kingdom) complement social insurance by social assistance
schemes. In Central Asia, maternity protection remains
a challenge. For example, in Azerbaijan, Georgia and
Kyrgyzstan, over 75 per cent of women in employment
still do not have access to maternity benefits despite existing social insurance schemes.

Unemployment protection
On average, 42.5 per cent of unemployed workers in
Europe and Central Asia receive unemployment benefits (see figure 6.36). The proportion is 57 per cent in
Eastern Europe, 46 per cent in Northern, Southern
and Western Europe, and only 12 per cent in Central
and Western Asia. The limited coverage ratios can be
explained by a number of factors, including high rates
of long-term unemployment in some countries, high
levels of informal employment in others, and the fact
that many unemployed workers do not register at the
employment offices. Among countries that complement
social insurance by unemployment assistance, Austria,
Germany and Ireland reach effective coverage levels
of 100 per cent of unemployed workers, while others
have lower effective coverage, ranging from 80 per cent
in Belgium, 73 per cent in the Netherlands and 62 per
cent in Malta to 45 per cent in Spain. In contrast, in
other parts of the region, particularly in Central Asia,
only a small minority of unemployed workers (12 per
cent on average) actually receive unemployment benefits. However, unemployed workers may still be eligible
for general social assistance benefits.

Disability benefits
The share of persons with severe disabilities that receive disability benefits is estimated at 87 per cent
(see figure 6.37). Comparison across the subregions
shows that Eastern Europe presents the highest coverage levels (close to 98 per cent), followed by Northern, Southern and Western Europe with around 92 per

cent, while in Central and Western Asia slightly more
than half the target population has access to disability
benefits. Most of the countries which achieve universal coverage provide disability cash benefits through
social insurance mechanisms (e.g. Belgium, Hungary
and Italy), a combination of social insurance and noncontributory universal benefits (e.g. Azerbaijan, Bulgaria and Latvia), or through means-tested schemes
(e.g. Armenia, Finland and Ireland). Others, such as
Georgia, rely exclusively on non-contributory benefits
(see also figure 3.25). In other parts of the region, particularly in Central and Western Asia, only half the
population with severe disabilities actually receives disability benefits.

Vulnerable population covered by social assistance (%)

Note: The number of vulnerable persons is estimated as (a) all children;
(b) persons of working age not contributing to a social insurance scheme
or receiving contributory benefits; and (c) persons above retirement age
not receiving contributory benefits (pensions). Social assistance is defined
as all forms of non-contributory cash transfers financed from general
taxation or other sources (other than social insurance). See also Annex II.
Sources: ILO, World Social Protection Database, based on SSI; OECD
SOCR; ILOSTAT; UNWPP; national sources. See also Annex IV, table B.3.

action?ressource.ressourceId=54717

the vulnerable population is achieved in countries such
as Belgium, Finland, France, Kazakhstan, Slovenia and
Sweden, elsewhere in the region a much smaller share
of the population is covered, as in parts of Central and
Western Asia. On average, one in three vulnerable persons is not covered by any social protection scheme (see
figure 6.39). There are however some positive trends in
the region, such as the gradual extension of social assistance benefits to families living in poverty in Kyrgyzstan
and Tajikistan.

Total social protection expenditure (excluding healthrelated expenditure) in the region is on average higher
than in other regions, estimated at around 16.5 per cent
of GDP allocated to social protection (see figure 6.40).
In many countries, ratios of social protection expenditure to GDP have increased, partly as a result of the
recession and higher unemployment rates (ILO, 2017f).
In other countries, expenditure on social protection as
a percentage of GDP has significantly decreased as part
of fiscal consolidation measures.
The variation between countries is significant: while
total social protection expenditure in Finland and
France reaches about 23 per cent of GDP, the Russian
Federation allocates around 11 per cent, and Armenia and Kazakhstan respectively 5.1 and 3.9 per cent
of their GDP to social protection. In fact, when comparing the subregions, Northern, Southern and Western Europe lead with an expenditure level of 17.7 per
cent of GDP, followed by Eastern Europe with 12.5 per
cent. In contrast, the expenditure level (9.0 per cent) in
Central and Western Asia is relatively low.
With regard to the composition of non-health social
protection expenditure, in the majority of countries a
significant share of expenditure is allocated to income
security of older persons (see figure 6.41), partly influenced by the demographic structure of the population.
Overall, Europe has the largest proportion of older persons in the world, yet there is significant diversity across
the region. While older persons account for 19.6 per
cent of the population in Northern, Southern and Western Europe, and 14.6 per cent in Eastern Europe, they
represent only 7.7 per cent of the population in Central
and Western Asia (see figure 4.4). Accordingly, the proportion of social protection expenditure allocated on
older persons varies considerably across the region.
Social protection expenditure on people of working age includes unemployment benefits, employment
injury benefits, disability benefits, maternity benefits
and general social assistance. Even though workingage persons form the biggest population group among
the total population, in some countries (for example
in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece,
Malta and Ukraine) expenditure on benefits for people
of working age accounts for only a small part of total
expenditure. In contrast, countries such as Armenia,
Belgium, Denmark and Finland present a more balanced distribution of social protection expenditure
across age groups.

This brief review of the state of social protection in
Europe and Central Asia has demonstrated that the
region has achieved laudable progress in building comprehensive social protection systems, including social
protection f loors, as set out in Recommendation
No. 202. However, significant gaps in coverage and
benefit adequacy remain, especially with respect to
ensuring adequate coverage for the self-employed and
those in non-standard forms of employment, including
the emerging new forms of work. In order to reach the
objectives defined under the SDGs, a particular focus
on the following actions will be essential:

Social protection expenditure on children varies
greatly across countries. Whereas it accounts for
roughly 3.8 per cent of GDP in the United Kingdom,
other countries allocate only a fraction of that amount
to child and family benefits. Expenditure on child
social protection is estimated at around 2.5 per cent
of GDP in Northern, Southern and Western Europe,
and 1.1 per cent in Eastern Europe (see figure 2.3). In
the case of Central and Western Asia, the low share
of public expenditure on child benefits (0.8 per cent
of GDP) is striking, considering the high proportion
of children in the total population; indeed, children
make up 25 per cent of the total population in the
subregion.
As child poverty is a significant challenge for the
region, the existing levels of social protection expenditure appear to be insufficient to respond adequately
to the income security needs of children and families,
including in the region’s high-income countries. This
is of concern particularly in Central and Western Asia,
where one in four persons is a child, as limited income
security for children can seriously hinder their development (UNICEF, 2015b, 2017).

• For those higher- and upper-middle income countries in the region which have already attained high
levels of coverage and benefit adequacy, it will be
essential to safeguard the progress achieved and
ensure that ongoing and future reforms do not jeopardize coverage and the adequacy of benefits, while
at the same time ensuring sustainable financing modalities based on an effective combination of contribution and tax funding. In this way, the challenge
of maintaining an equitable balance between benefit
adequacy and financial sustainability can be met.

• For those countries which still struggle with limited
coverage and low benefit levels, the priority will be
to extend coverage to the population groups not
yet covered, with a view to achieving universal coverage and at the same time ensuring that benefit
levels are adequate to meet people’s needs. In some
countries this will require increased efforts to fight
undeclared work and facilitate the transition to the
formal economy, and to ensure sustainable financing modalities based on a combination of contributions and general taxation.
• To accelerate progress towards achieving SDG target
1.3 and related goals, greater attention to closing
coverage and adequacy gaps is essential. A number
of countries have already prioritized social protection in their national voluntary reviews with a view
to achieving the 2030 Agenda, namely Azerbaijan,
Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Montenegro, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.

• Throughout the region more efforts will be required
to ensure that social protection systems adequately
cover people in all forms of employment, with particular emphasis on enhancing protection for the
self-employed and workers in non-standard forms
of employment, including new forms of employment. Innovative solutions are required to ensure
that social protection mechanisms are adapted to
the particular characteristics of these groups and to
labour market dynamics.

KEY MESSAGES
nn
SDG 1.3 commits countries to implementing nationally appropriate social protection systems for all, including floors, for reducing and preventing poverty. Despite significant
progress in recent years, only 29 per cent of the global population have access to comprehensive social security systems in all areas, from child benefits to old-age pensions, while
the rest are covered only partially or not at all.
nn
According to 2015 figures, the percentage of the global population effectively covered by
at least one social protection benefit (or SDG indicator 1.3.1) stands at only 45 per cent,
which means that more than half of the global population are not effectively protected in
any area of social protection. Social protection coverage for children is still insufficient: only
one in three children (35 per cent) are covered, pointing to significant underinvestment
in children and families. Only 41 per cent of women with newborns receive maternity
cash benefits that provide them with income security during the critical period. Income
security for unemployed workers is also a challenge, with only one in five unemployed
workers (22 per cent) receiving an unemployment benefit. Large coverage gaps exist also
for persons with severe disabilities: worldwide, only 28 per cent receive disability benefits.
Effective pension coverage for older persons stands at 68 per cent of all persons above
retirement age worldwide. Despite significant progress in the extension of social protection
coverage, many are left unprotected; renewed efforts are needed to realize the human right
to social security and achieve the SDGs.
nn
This report presents up-to-date data to monitor SDG 1.3, providing the 2015 baseline
for the SDG indicator 1.3.1. The report is based on the ILO World Social Protection
Database and the Social Security Inquiry, an ILO administrative survey regularly submitted
to countries. Monitoring progress in achieving the SDGs requires investment in national
capacities in the area of social protection statistics, including additional efforts at the
national, regional and international levels to improve the regular collection, analysis and
dissemination of social protection data.
nn
Moving forward towards universal social protection and achieving the SDGs will require
efforts in a number of areas. Extending social protection coverage to those in the informal
economy and facilitating their transition to the formal economy are key to tackling decent
work deficits and preventing poverty and vulnerability. More broadly, promoting inclusive
social protection systems, including floors, is a precondition for improving the living standards of vulnerable populations and achieving the SDGs. Yet this will only be possible if
the benefits provided meet the needs of the population and guarantee adequate levels
of protection. Greater efforts are needed to ensure not only universal coverage, but also
adequate benefit levels. This is also essential in tackling future challenges associated with
demographic change, the evolving world of work, migration, fragile contexts and environmental challenges, to ensure that social protection systems are well adapted to realize the
right of social security for all.

KEY MESSAGES (cont’d)
nn
Despite significant progress in the extension of social protection globally, a number of
countries have undertaken fiscal consolidation or austerity policies since 2010. These
short-term adjustments are affecting a number of public expenditures, among them social
protection spending. This is well documented for high-income countries, which have
reduced a range of social protection benefits; together with persistent unemployment,
lower wages and higher taxes, these measures have contributed to the rise in poverty now
affecting 86 million people in the European Union, representing more than 17 per cent
of the population. Depressed household income levels are leading to lower domestic consumption and lower demand, slowing recovery. Fiscal consolidation is not limited to Europe:
in 2018, 124 countries – 81 of them developing countries – will be adjusting expenditures
in terms of their GDP and will hover around those levels until 2020.
nn
It does not need to be a decade of austerity and budget cuts; fiscal space exists even in
the poorest countries. There is a wide variety of options to generate resources for social
protection; specifically, there are eight financing options, supported by policy statements of
the international financial institutions and the United Nations. It is imperative that countries
become proactive in exploring all possible financing alternatives to promote the SDGs and
their national development through jobs and social protection.
nn
At present, the world is united in the advancement of universal social protection. Strengthening social protection systems, including floors, is supported through the joint efforts of
the United Nations agencies at different levels, and through concerted joint efforts with
relevant international, regional, subregional and national institutions and social partners,
including the Global Partnership for Universal Social Protection.

7.1.1 Monitoring SDG indicator 1.3.1
at the global level
Social protection plays a key role in achieving sustainable development by guaranteeing that individuals
enjoy income security and have effective access to health
care. Despite significant progress in recent years, the
human right to social security is still not a reality for
many people in the world: only 29 per cent of the global
population have access to comprehensive social security
systems in all areas,1 while the rest are covered only partially or not at all. Within this overall figure, regional
variations are considerable. If the 2030 Development
Agenda is to be achieved, further efforts are required
to build social protection systems, including floors, in
order to fully harness the key role of social protection in
promoting social and economic development.

Building on the discussion in Chapters 1–6 of this
report, this section will summarize the key results for
SDG indicator 1.3.1 at the global level, and provide
further detail to the statistics published in the United
Nations Secretary-General’s 2017 report on progress
towards the Social Development Goals (UN, 2017c).
Effective social protection coverage in at least one
area stands at only 45.2 per cent of the global population (see figures 7.1 and 7.2). More than half the
global population is not effectively protected in any
social protection area. 2 Regional variation is considerable: in most countries in Europe and Central Asia,
as well as in Canada and Uruguay, more than 90 per
cent of the population is protected in at least one area.
In contrast, less than 30 per cent of the population
is protected in most of those countries in Africa for
which data were available, with the notable exception
of Egypt and South Africa. The Americas, with a regional estimate of 67.6 per cent of the population covered in at least one area, reflect the significant progress

Social protection includes child and family benefits, maternity protection, unemployment support, employment injury benefits, sickness
benefits, health protection, old-age benefits, disability benefits, and survivors’ benefits. Social protection systems address all these policy
areas by a mix of contributory schemes (social insurance) and non-contributory tax-financed benefits, including social assistance.

made in the extension of social protection coverage in
recent years. In Asia and the Pacific, the regional coverage estimate of 39 per cent of the population hides
large regional variations, with relatively high coverage
in countries such as Australia, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and New Zealand, and limited coverage
in some other countries in the region for which data are
available. This significant disparity in coverage generally
reflects the global trend that higher levels of social protection coverage are usually associated with countries
that have higher levels of economic development, yet
some countries, such as China and Uruguay, demonstrate that sustained efforts in extending coverage can
be successful at any level of development.

Progress in extending social protection coverage requires the allocation of an adequate level of resources
(see section 7.2.7 below). Only if countries invest a sufficient amount of resources, their social protection systems
can positively contribute to economic and social development, the realization of the right to social security
and the achievement of the SDGs. Underinvestment
in social protection, particularly in Africa, Asia and the
Arab States, constitutes one of the obstacles to inclusive
growth and sustainable development (figure 7.2).

Child and family benefits
Social protection benefits play a vital role in improving children’s healthy development and well-being by
enhancing income security for families, reducing and
preventing poverty and vulnerability, and facilitating
access to health and other social services. Yet social protection for children remains a significant challenge in
many parts of the world, as described in Chapter 2. The
global coverage estimate (see figure 7.1) shows that only
one in three children receives child or family benefits;
that is, 34.9 per cent of children receive benefits (SDG
indicator 1.3.1 for children), whereas two-thirds of all
children are not covered.
In Europe and Central Asia, 87.5 per cent of all
children between the age of 0 and 14 receive a child or
family benefit, yet with large regional variation; while
many countries in the region have achieved effective
universal child coverage, others provide child and family
benefits to less than 10 per cent of all children aged
between 0–14. The regional estimate for the Americas
shows that two out of three children receive a child or
family benefit, which is partly due to the extension of
cash transfer programmes there, yet benefit levels are
often modest. In the Arab States, the available data do
not allow for the calculation of a regional estimate. In
Africa, children constitute 43 per cent of the population, yet only 15.9 per cent of all children aged 0–14
receive child or family cash benefits. Similarly, in Asia,

the provision of social protection for children remains
a challenge, with the exception of Australia and Mongolia, although data constraints do not allow the calculation of a regional estimate. In many countries the
coverage of children aged between 0 and 14 receiving
cash benefits is as low as 30 per cent or even less.
A worldwide positive trend is the extension of coverage, with a significant number of governments announcing the extension of cash benefits for children.
However, fiscal consolidation pressures have pushed
several countries to reduce benefit levels or limit coverage of children, with negative repercussions on families.

Maternity protection
Pregnancy and birth are critical periods in the lives of
mothers and children, and are often characterized by
significant health and income risks. Maternity protection is essential for alleviating these risks for mothers,
and for giving children a good start in life, as explained
in Chapter 3. While significant progress has been
achieved with regard to access to maternity health care,
income security for pregnant women and new mothers
is lagging behind.
The large majority (59 per cent) of mothers with
newborns worldwide still do not have access to maternity benefit schemes (SDG indicator 1.3.1 for mothers
with newborns). In Africa, only 16 per cent of mothers

7. Monitoring progress in social protection: Global outlook

with newborns receive maternity cash benefits which
provide them with at least a basic level of income security during this critical period of their lives. In Asia
and the Pacific, effective coverage is significantly higher,
yet only one-third of all women in employment receive
maternity cash benefits, thus leaving two-thirds of
women unprotected. The challenges of extending coverage often relate to high levels of informal employment and the lack of appropriate maternity protection
mechanisms for women working outside the formal
economy.
The higher levels of effective coverage in Europe and
Central Asia (81 per cent) and the Americas (69 per
cent) are partly due to the fact that several countries in
these regions, particularly among the Member States of
the European Union, have achieved universal coverage,
yet major challenges persist in the remaining countries
to provide universal coverage for childbearing women.
In both developing and advanced economies, recent
progress has been made in extending maternity protection coverage through social insurance. The shift away
from employer liability is essential in removing disincentives for the employment of women. However, it is also
important to provide maternity protection for those
women working in the informal economy or in nonstandard employment who do not qualify for contributory benefits. In this context, some countries in Asia,
Africa and Latin America have introduced or extended
non-contributory schemes and programmes. Another
challenge relates to the improvement of benefit adequacy in both ensuring income security during maternity leave and providing access to maternal health care.

Unemployment support
Unemployment support is essential to ensure income
security in the event of job loss, and while seeking for
another job. It contributes to reducing and preventing
poverty, as well as to better job-matching and supporting
structural change of the economy (see section 3.3). Yet,
compared to other contingencies, access to unemployment protection is still very limited across the world.
Worldwide, only 22 per cent of unemployed workers
actually receive unemployment benefits (SDG indicator 1.3.1 for the unemployed), as discussed in Chapter 3.
Regional variation is large. Effective coverage stands
at 43 per cent of unemployed workers in Europe and
Central Asia, despite the region’s mature and comprehensive social security systems. Possible reasons
for the low coverage include the exhaustion of benefit

entitlements or non-fulfilment of entitlement requirements. In other regions, effective coverage ratios are
even lower, reaching 23 per cent of jobseekers in the
Asia and Pacific region, 17 per cent in the Americas and
6 per cent in Africa. The majority of countries in these
regions still lack effective unemployment protection
schemes. Even in those countries that have unemployment insurance schemes in place, the proportion of unemployed workers receiving unemployment benefits is
still relatively low, due to still relatively high levels of
informal employment.
Despite significant coverage gaps worldwide, some
countries, including low- and middle-income countries,
have extended access to existing or new unemployment
protection benefits and/or extended coverage to those
previously excluded. Other countries have expanded the
scope of protection by providing employment promotion measures such as skills development and employment services as part of an integrated package, and by
complementing unemployment cash benefits with training and other labour market policies. However, some
of these expansionary measures have given way to fiscal
consolidation measures that take the form of tighter entitlement conditions for unemployment benefits, lower
maximum benefit duration or reduced benefit levels.

Disability benefits
Disability benefits are key to ensuring employment,
income security and independent living for persons
with disabilities (see Chapter 3). Nevertheless, worldwide only some 28 per cent of persons with severe
disabilities receive cash disability benefits (SDG indicator 1.3.1 for persons with disabilities), with wide
variations across regions (see figure 7.1). While nearly
87 per cent of persons with severe disabilities receive
disability benefits in Europe and Central Asia, and
almost 73 per cent in the Americas, coverage in Asia
and the Pacific is limited to only 9.4 per cent of persons
with severe disabilities; comparable regional estimates
are not available for Africa and the Arab States.
Recent developments in this area include the extension of coverage in some countries in parts of Asia and
Africa through non-contributory disability cash benefits, either by mainstreaming disability in broader social
protection schemes or by creating specific schemes for
persons with disabilities. Despite this progress, other
countries are limiting coverage of their disability benefits as part of their austerity measures, leaving many
persons with disabilities without protection.

Old-age pensions

172

Old-age pensions play a vital role in ensuring income security in old age, preventing old-age poverty and maintaining income levels after retirement (see Chapter 4).
In fact, older people (65 years and above) are among
the most widely covered population groups compared
to children or persons of working age. Effective pension coverage stands at 68 per cent of all older persons
worldwide (SDG indicator 1.3.1 for older persons),
partly due to the fact that many countries have stepped
up their efforts in providing universal old-age protection, as shown in Chapter 4. Europe and Central Asia
and the Americas lead the global trend with, respectively, 95 and 86 per cent of the older population receiving an old-age pension. While almost all older persons
in Europe and Northern America receive pensions,
many countries, particularly those under austerity pressures, are struggling to find a balance between the adequacy of benefits and the financial sustainability of
their pension systems.
In Asia and the Pacific, the extension of coverage
in many countries, particularly in China, has contributed to a regional coverage ratio of more than half of
all persons over retirement age. Africa has also achieved
notable success, yet effective coverage still stands at
only 30 per cent of the population above retirement
age. Challenges in these countries in implementing, extending and financing pension schemes are more linked
to structural barriers, such as high levels of informal
employment, low contributory capacity and limited
fiscal space.
A positive trend in developing economies in recent
years has been the introduction of non-contributory
pensions, especially in countries with high levels of informal employment which face difficulties in extending contributory pension schemes, yet benefit levels are
often very low.

Social assistance
In recent years, non-contributory benefits have received
greater attention as a means of closing gaps in social
protection coverage and ensuring at least a basic level of
protection for all. But despite significant progress in the
extension of coverage through contributory schemes,
many people are left unprotected, largely due to high
levels of informal employment. Therefore, an additional
indicator reflects the proportion of the vulnerable
population, defined as all children and adults without

social insurance coverage receiving non-contributory
benefits, including social assistance. The global estimate
shows that only one in four persons (25 per cent) considered as vulnerable – children, persons of working
age and older persons not contributing to social insurance – receives a non-contributory benefit (SDG indicator 1.3.1 on vulnerable persons). While in Europe
and Central Asia, 67 per cent of vulnerable persons receive non-contributory benefits, this is the case for only
39 per cent in the Americas, 16 per cent in Asia and
Pacific and 10 per cent in Africa.
7.1.2 Building the statistical knowledge base
on social protection to monitor the SDGs
Monitoring progress in building social protection systems, including floors, and achieving the SDGs requires systematic investment in national capacities
in the area of social protection statistics. This necessitates additional efforts at the national, regional and
international levels to strengthen monitoring frameworks and the regular collection, analysis and dissemination of data and key indicators, including data
disaggregated by sex, age group and disability status,
so that these data can provide useful guidance for
policy-makers and other stakeholders. ILO Recommendation No. 202 includes a strong commitment by
governments and social partners to monitor progress
in extending social protection, including through participatory mechanisms.
Progress towards building social protection systems,
including floors, and the achievement of SDG 1.3, require greater attention to enhancing monitoring capacities in order to provide a solid evidence base for
policy-makers.
Reliable social security statistics based on a shared
methodology and agreed definitions, concepts and
principles regarding data to be collected are an important precondition for good governance and
policy-making. The lack of quality and up-to-date
social protection data and statistics is a serious problem
affecting most developing countries; it is a real stumbling block in identifying and closing gaps in social
protection. Standardized information regarding key
policy characteristics of these different social security
programmes, such as the number of people covered,
benefit levels and costs, financing sources, frequency
and quality of the provision offered, is lacking in many
countries. Tackling the problem requires a major effort
at both national and international levels.

7. Monitoring progress in social protection: Global outlook

The ILO has for decades been supporting its
member States in collecting, compiling and analysing
social protection statistics, including through the ILO
Cost of Social Security Inquiry since the 1940s, an administrative survey regularly submitted to countries
and guided by the International Conference of Labour
Statisticians.3 The ILO revised the Social Security Inquiry in 2015 to reflect the SDGs; the 2016 edition of
the SSI questionnaire is available online, together with
the SSI Manual (ILO, 2016c).4
The information received by the ILO SSI is compiled in the ILO’s World Social Protection Database,
complemented by other sources.5 At global level, the
database is the main source of information on social
protection, allowing the collecting, storing and dissemination of a comprehensive set of statistical data and
indicators on social protection worldwide. It contains
information on the configuration of national social protection systems; the cost, expenditure and revenues of
social protection schemes; and data on effective and
legal coverage, including recipients of social benefits and
benefit amounts.
Still, a greater effort is needed at all levels in order
to develop and maintain the system of indicators that
permit the monitoring of the SDGs related to social
protection. Countries should attach higher importance to the production of statistics and indicators, allocating greater efforts and resources to this goal. The
international community should support efforts in that
direction, including the provision of technical support
to developing countries on issues of design, implementation and capacity-building. Monitoring progress in
achieving the SDGs requires investment in national
capacities in the area of social protection statistics, including additional efforts at the national, regional and
international levels to improve the regular collection,
analysis and dissemination of social protection data.

7.2 Moving forward towards universal social
protection and achieving the SDGs
In order to accomplish the objectives of Agenda 2030,
an increase in effort is necessary to accelerate progress
in the extension of social protection as an investment in
people, and to ensure that the range and level of benefits provided adequately meet the needs of the population. More efforts are also necessary to ensure that
social protection systems are well institutionalized and
anchored in law and national development strategies,
that they rely on a stable and sustainable funding base,
and that they are effectively and efficiently governed
and managed.
The following sections address some specific challenges and opportunities for social protection policies
that need to be tackled to accelerate progress towards
the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development.
7.2.1 Extending social protection coverage
to those in the informal economy
and facilitating their transition
to the formal economy
About half the global workforce is in informal employment, and the large majority of these people face serious
gaps in decent work, including a lack of access to social
protection. This lack of protection traps workers and
their families in a vicious cycle of vulnerability, poverty
and social exclusion. It is a huge impediment not only to
their individual welfare and their enjoyment of human
rights (in particular the right to social security), but also
to their countries’ economic and social development.
Workers in the informal economy typically lack coverage through contributory mechanisms (social insurance and other contributory schemes), due to a variety
of factors including exclusion from legal coverage, weak
compliance, limited contributory capacities, low and

The Resolution concerning the development of social security statistics, adopted in 1957, is still the only internationally agreed
comprehensive framework for social protection statistics (ICLS, 1957).

The ILO World Social Protection Database complements the data received from the Social Security Inquiry, as far as possible on a
consistent basis, with a number of other international and regional data sources, notably the International Social Security Association’s
(ISSA) Social Security Observatory and the ISSA and SSA’s Social Security Programs Throughout the World (ISSA Social Security
Country Profiles), as a main source of information for calculating the figures on legal coverage. Other sources are (in alphabetical order):
the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) Social Protection Index (SPI); the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
(ECLAC) and other regional commissions of the United Nations; the Statistical Office of the European Commission (Eurostat) including
the Eurostat European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS); the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development’s Social Expenditure (OECD SOCX): the World Bank pensions and the Atlas of Social Protection Indicators of Resilience
and Equity (ASPIRE), and the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory and National Health Accounts.

volatile earnings, and complex administrative procedures. At the same time, workers in the informal economy
are often excluded from programmes explicitly targeted
towards poor individuals or households with limited
earning capacities. This leaves many informal workers,
many of them women, without effective coverage, as the
“missing middle” (ILO, forthcoming b; Ulrichs, 2016).
Enterprises benefit in several ways from covering
their workers. Better social protection for workers has
positive impacts on labour productivity and competitiveness through better access to health care, lower
absentee rates, higher employee retention and higher
motivation (Scheil-Adlung, 2014). For example, a recent
study found that in Viet Nam, firms which increased
their social security coverage by 10 per cent between
2006 and 2011 experienced a revenue gain per worker
of between 1.1 and 2.6 per cent and a profit gain of
around 1.3–3.0 per cent (Lee and Torm, 2017).
Social insurance is an important instrument in
pooling financial risks for enterprises, particularly the
risks of employment injury, maternity and dismissal.
Where employers can rely on social insurance mechanisms instead of being individually liable for the compensation of workers (employer liability), they can
better plan and manage financial flows and handle risks
in a more predictable way. For this reason, social insurance offers important benefits to employers, such as
maternity benefits, employment injury insurance and
unemployment insurance (e.g. Kuddo, Robalino and
Weber, 2015). Ensuring full social protection coverage
for workers therefore makes good business sense as it
helps to strengthen labour productivity and competitiveness and offers more business opportunities.
Extending social protection coverage to workers in
the informal economy also entails a number of benefits to society at large, particularly where these contribute to facilitating transition from the informal to
the formal economy. The expansion of social insurance
mechanisms to larger groups of previously uncovered
workers can help to achieve a better financing mix for
the social protection system, which alleviates pressures
on tax-financed social assistance benefits. It also shares
the burden of financing the social protection system
through contributions and taxes in a more equitable
way among those who have contributory capacity, and

ensures that contributions and taxes are in line with contributory capacities (ILO, 2013a; ISSA, 2016a). It also
helps to ensure the sustainability and adequacy of the
social protection system in the long run (ILO, 2014a).
Successful examples of the extension of social protection coverage to workers in the informal economy
have focused on two broad policy approaches:6
1. Extension of coverage through contributory mechanisms. In many countries, the extension of social protection to larger groups of the population has focused
mainly on employment-based social protection mechanisms (typically social insurance). This approach tends
to focus on specific groups of workers who are already
rather close to the formal economy and have some contributory capacity, and are therefore relatively easily
covered by employment-based social protection mechanisms. In many cases the extension strategy includes
not only a change in legislation, but also measures to
remove administrative obstacles to contributions by
facilitating administrative processes as well as adapting contribution rates and benefit packages. Examples
include the inclusion of domestic workers in maternity
and unemployment insurance (South Africa), occupation/sector-based mutual funds (Senegal), facilitating
micro enterprise registration and tax/contribution collection through monotax (monotributo) mechanisms
(Argentina, Uruguay, see box 7.1), and the inclusion
of self-employed workers in social insurance schemes
(e.g. Ghana, Kenya, United Republic of Tanzania).7
2. Extension of coverage through non-contributory
mechanisms (social transfers). In other countries, the
extension of social protection to larger groups of the
population has been pursued through a large-scale extension of non-contributory social protection mechanisms to previously uncovered groups, independently
of their employment status, and largely financed
through government revenue stemming from taxation,
mineral resource revenue or external grants, or by a
combination of contributions and taxes. This approach
could be summarized as the “extension of social protection independently of status”, based on the expectation
that by “investing in people” through social protection
which helps to facilitate access to health and social services, to enhance income security and to enable workers
to take greater risks, positive results on human capital

6
These approaches are reflected in both the ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202), and the Transition from the
Informal to the Formal Economy Recommendation, 2015 (No. 204).
7
However, the extension of social insurance coverage through voluntary mechanisms rarely leads to a substantial increase in coverage.
More promising are carefully designed mandatory mechanisms adapted to the particular characteristics and contributory capacities of the
target group.

7. Monitoring progress in social protection: Global outlook

Box 7.1 Extending social protection and facilitating transition
to the formal economy: Uruguay’s monotax
Monotax is a simplified tax and contribution collection mechanism for small contributors in Uruguay.
The microentrepreneurs who select this option,
as well as their workers, are automatically entitled
to the benefits of the contributory social security
system (except for unemployment protection).
Through the monotax mechanism, a single payment
covering taxes and contributions is collected by the
Uruguayan Social Security Institute (BPS), which

transfers the tax payments to the fiscal authority
and then uses the remaining share to finance social
security benefits for affiliated members and their
families. The monotax mechanism has proved an
effective tool to extend social security coverage
to self-employed workers, especially women, and
to formalize micro- and small enterprises (see
figure 7.3). Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador have developed similar mechanisms.

and productivity can be generated that facilitate the
formalization of employment in the medium and long
terms. Examples include cash transfer programmes for
children and families in Brazil and Mexico; social pensions in Lesotho, Mauritius, Namibia, Nepal, South
Africa and Timor-Leste; or the extension of health protection funded through a combination of taxes and contributions in Colombia, Ghana, Rwanda and Thailand.
7.2.2 Promoting inclusive social protection
systems, including floors
Social protection systems are among the key policy
instruments that policy-makers have at their disposal
to address inequalities and advance social inclusion.
Yet existing patterns of inequality, discrimination and
structural disadvantage are often reflected in social protection systems. For this reason it is essential to better
understand the drivers behind social exclusion, and to
design and implement social protection systems in such
a way as to mitigate and overcome marginalization,

discrimination and structural disadvantage, and promote social inclusion (Babajanian and Hagen-Zanker,
2012). Only if these drivers are understood and addressed in the design, implementation and monitoring
of social protection systems can these systems realize
their full potential in addressing inequalities and promoting social inclusion, and thus contribute to attaining SDGs 1, 5 and 10 (UN, forthcoming).
One of the areas where significant – yet not sufficient – progress has been made is ensuring gender
equality in social protection systems. Many studies have
pointed to the various ways in which social protection
systems can reflect and reproduce economic and social
gender inequalities, and have called for greater attention
to this issue (e.g. Sabates-Wheeler and Kabeer, 2003;
Kabeer, 2008; Jones and Holmes, 2013). For contributory schemes this concerns, for example, the ways in
which shorter and more often interrupted employment
careers, gender wage gaps and higher levels of informal
employment and engagement in unpaid work lead to
lower pension coverage and benefit levels for women.
In some countries, these issues have been addressed

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

176

through a better recognition of care work (Fultz, 2011;
ILO, 2016a) and enhanced minimum pension guarantees, although the greater reliance on private provision
may have adverse effects for women (see Chapter 4).
In non-contributory schemes, concerns about gender
equality have focused on the gender bias in conditional
cash transfer (CCT) schemes, which reinforce traditional gender roles (e.g. Molyneux, 2007), as well on
low levels of benefits, overly restrictive eligibility criteria
and targeting methods and other programme features
(e.g. Fultz and Francis, 2013; Plagerson and Ulriksen,
2015; Orozco Corona and Gammage, 2017).
The discussion of social protection for persons with
disabilities in Chapter 3 has demonstrated the double
challenge of ensuring inclusive social protection systems: on one hand, every component of the social protection system needs to be inclusive of persons with
disabilities, which requires the identification, analysis
and removal of possible barriers that could hinder their
effective access to social security; on the other hand,
the specific needs of persons with disabilities need to
be recognized and addressed, which may require a coordinated combination of cash benefits with benefits
in kind and services, enabling persons with disabilities
to continue independent living and participate fully in
education, employment and society at large. The guidance provided in Recommendation No. 202 is an important step forward towards ensuring inclusive social
protection for persons with disabilities in line with the
UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), 2006 (UN, 2015a).
Similarly, ensuring that social protection systems are
HIV-sensitive helps to overcome the policy and social
barriers that otherwise leave behind people living with,
at risk of or affected by HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS,
2017). This includes, among other things, the effective
combination of income support, where necessary, with
measures to ensure effective access to health care, meeting both HIV-specific and general needs, in line with
the ILO HIV and AIDS Recommendation, 2010
(No. 200), and Recommendation No. 202.
Ensuring the inclusion of indigenous women, men
and children in social protection systems is of major
importance, given that indigenous peoples are often
excluded, partly due to broader patterns of marginalization, discrimination and social exclusion. Social
protection systems should therefore not only alleviate
poverty and vulnerability, but also contribute to tackling the root causes of inequality and poverty, while
respecting indigenous peoples’ cultural integrity and
development aspirations. This requires a more ambitious

approach in the development of innovative means that
include the participation of the peoples concerned. In
this regard, recognition of and respect for indigenous
peoples’ collective and individual rights, including their
right to consultation and participation and to define
their own priorities for development, play a fundamental
role. Such an approach would reflect the guidance provided by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), 2007, as well as the
ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989
(No. 169), together with Recommendation No. 202 and
other social security standards (ILO, forthcoming e).
Significant progress has been made in recent years in
rendering social protection systems more inclusive, particularly through ensuring at least a basic level of social
security through a social protection floor. However,
greater efforts are necessary to ensure that social protection systems contribute to a transformative change that
reverses the underlying patterns of discrimination and
disadvantage and realizes the human right to social security for all (UNRISD, 2016).
7.2.3 Ensuring adequate benefits
While the world has achieved significant progress towards the extension of social protection coverage in
many areas, ensuring the adequacy of benefits remains
a major challenge for the coming years. As required
under SDG 1, social protection systems will have a significant impact on preventing and reducing poverty if
benefits are adequate and meet people’s needs. This concerns first and foremost the levels of cash benefits, yet
other aspects such as the range and scope of available
benefits, eligibility criteria and predictability of benefits
also play an important role.
Social protection benefits are an important source of
livelihood for millions of persons around the world and
play a key role in preventing and alleviating poverty. To
ensure that social protection systems fully meet their
objectives, it is essential that they are well designed, and
adequacy of benefits is a critical design element. Benefits
must be able to guarantee at least a basic level of social
security – a social protection floor – to ensure income
security and effective access to health care. Regularly
adjusting the level of benefits to offset increases in the
cost of living is also an important element when designing social protection systems.
Since poverty is multidimensional, individual wellbeing depends not only on the level of income, but also
on access to other social benefits and public services, all

7. Monitoring progress in social protection: Global outlook

arrangements including support to the poor and the
vulnerable, and intergenerational solidarity. ILO Recommendation No. 202 comprises a set of principles,
including, among others, a rights-based approach based
on entitlements prescribed by national law and the adequacy and predictability of benefits (ILO, 2014a).
Similar principles are contained in ILO Convention
No. 102, which sets out minimum standards for all
nine policy areas, including minimum standards for the
level of periodic cash benefits. Other ILO Conventions
and Recommendations provide guidance on specific
areas. For example, for old-age, disability and survivors’
pensions, Convention No. 128 and Recommendation
No. 131 set adequacy standards for pension benefits, including for their revision following substantial changes
in levels of earnings or costs of living. Annex III to this
report summarizes the minimum requirements for all
nine areas (see also ILO, 2017b).
Despite global progress in social protection, adequacy of benefits remains a major challenge. As shown
in figure 7.4, in countries such as Armenia, Belize, the
Plurinational State of Bolivia, Colombia, India and
Turkey the amount of the non-contributory pension
represents less than 50 per cent of the value of the national poverty line. Older persons receiving a social
pension in these countries are still poor.
If the level of benefits provided by social protection systems is insufficient in terms of minimum living
standards, this will jeopardize the achievements of the
poverty reduction goals of the 2030 Agenda. The adequacy of benefits thus plays a crucial role in strategies
for achieving the SDGs on social protection.

of them forming a floor of protection. For this reason, a
consideration of the adequacy of benefits should simultaneously include the access of recipients, i.e. families or
individuals, to an adequate mix of in-cash and in-kind
benefits such as education, housing, health care, longterm care, water and nutrition, among others (European Commission, 2015c).

minimum considered socially acceptable, vary across
societies and depend on the prevailing attitudes on
such matters as the distribution of responsibilities
between the State and the individual, redistribution

7.2.4 Tackling demographic change
Global demographic trends present a challenging scenario for social protection systems in various ways (ILO,
2013c). Trends are characterized by a number of complex phenomena: the world population will continue
to grow in coming decades, despite the continued decline in fertility rates. The world’s population will be
concentrated in the developing world, including older
people: by 2050, three-quarters of the world’s old-age
population will live in developing countries. Longevity will continue to increase significantly, reaching also
rural populations; as women live longer than men, and
their life expectancy grows faster, this will determine a
process of feminization of ageing.
In the developing world, the cohorts of the young
working-age population are large and will continue to

grow, creating a window of opportunity for the development and financing of social protection; in high‑income
countries, the opposite will happen. Globally, the fastest-growing age group will be people aged 80 and older,
so that this “oldest old” group will quadruple in the
next four decades. In the meantime, however, children
and youth are still a much larger group, requiring necessary investments.
Globally, the total demographic dependency ratio
will remain relatively stable over the next four decades:
while the global share of older persons will increase, particularly in Asia, the proportion of children will decline,
as shown in figure 7.5. However, these averages conceal very important regional differences. In Africa, a decline in the demographic dependency ratio is expected
because the increase in the proportion of older persons
will be more than offset by a reduction in the proportion of children and an increase in the proportion of the
population in working age. Similarly, in the Arab States
the demographic dependency ratio will decline because
the share of children will fall and the proportion of the
working-age population will rise slightly, thus compensating the expected greater share of older persons. In
Asia and the Pacific, a quite heterogeneous demographic
region, the demographic dependency ratio will remain
constant because the increase in the proportion of older
persons will be offset by a reduction in the proportion
of children, while a slight decrease in the proportion
of people in working age is expected. Similarly, in the
Americas the dependency ratio will remain more or less
stable, as the rise in the proportion of older persons will
be stronger than the reduction in the proportion of children, while the population in active age will decrease
slightly. Trends vary significantly in Europe and Central
Asia, where an increase in the demographic dependency rate is expected because although the proportion
of children will decline slightly, the rise in the number
of older persons will be accompanied by a reduction in
the share of working-age population. These large regional variations suggest that generalizations need to
be avoided, in particular the arguments of an “old-age
crisis” often used to precipitate pension reforms.
Understanding demographic trends is crucial for
implementing the 2030 Agenda, particularly for SDG 1
on poverty eradication. Poverty reduction efforts need
in particular to tackle child poverty and poverty in
old age. Countries must design policies appropriate to
their specific demographic context, avoiding focusing
reforms on the reduction of social welfare.

7.2.5 The future of work and social protection
The world of work is undergoing major changes. Digitalization and automation have facilitated the emergence of new forms of employment, such as work on
digital platforms, and have led in some countries to
an increase in on-call employment or other forms of
temporary and part-time employment, as well as dependent self-employment and temporary agency work,
often referred to as non-standard forms of employment
(ILO, 2016b, 2016q; ISSA, 2016b; Degryse, 2016). 8
While such forms of employment may provide greater
flexibility to enterprises, for workers they often translate into lower and volatile earnings and higher levels
of income insecurity, inadequate or unregulated working conditions, and no or limited social security entitlements (ILO, 2016b, 2017f; Matsaganis et al., 2016).
Such new forms of employment are not limited to highincome countries; in many middle-income countries,
e.g. China, India, Malaysia or Thailand, a growing
class of unprotected workers in new forms of employment now co-exists with a large number of workers engaged in traditional forms of work such as subsistence
agriculture.
Changing work and employment relationships,
alongside weakening labour market institutions, have
contributed to growing levels of inequality and insecurity in many parts of the world (Berg, 2015b), and
to weakening the implicit social contract in many societies (ILO, 2016b, 2016r). Growing precarization
calls for greater attention to employment, wage and
social protection policies to ensure that the fruits of
economic growth are shared on a more equitable basis
(ILO, 2016r). In this context, social protection and its
potential to reduce and prevent poverty as well as to address inequality remain as relevant as ever (SDG targets
1.3, 5.4 and 10.4).
Various policy options are being discussed on how
social protection systems can adapt to the changing
nature of work and close social protection gaps. For example, some governments have introduced measures to
extend social protection coverage to certain categories
of non-salaried and vulnerable workers, including those
with multiple employers (Hill, 2015), or to non-regular workers as well as those in self-employment (ILO,
2016b; European Commission, 2017b). Coverage of
workers in non-standard employment may also be improved by lowering thresholds regarding minimum
working hours, earnings or duration of employment,

179

180

allowing for more flexibility on contributions required
to qualify and on interruptions in contributions, and
enhancing the portability of benefits between different social security schemes and employment statuses to
ensure continued protection for those moving between
jobs (ILO, 2016b).
In addition, there is a renewed debate about a universal basic income (UBI) as a way of improving income
security in the face of uncertain availability of jobs. As
argued by proponents, it would guarantee a minimum
standard of living for everyone irrespective of employment, age and gender, and would give people the freedom and space to live the life they want. Its proponents
also argue that a UBI may contribute to alleviating
poverty while reducing the administrative complexity
and cost of existing social protection systems. A wide
range of proposals are being discussed under the label of
UBI, highly divergent in terms of objectives, proposed
benefit levels, financing mechanisms and other features.
Opponents of UBI proposals dispute its economic, political and social feasibility, question its capacity to address the structural causes of poverty and inequality,
and fear that it may entail disincentives to work. Moreover, it is argued that a UBI – especially neoliberal or
libertarian UBI proposals that aim at abolishing the
welfare state – may increase poverty and inequality and
undermine labour market institutions such as collective
bargaining.
Some basic income experiments have already started
or are planned in advanced and developing economies
alike. The currently most advanced pilot, in Finland,
implements a partial basic income for 2,000 selected
jobseekers (see box 3.12). Other developments include
small pilot programmes in India, Kenya and Uganda.
So far, though, no country has initiated a fully fledged
UBI as a main pillar of income support which would
be sufficient to guarantee a national social protection
floor. Recent calculations by the OECD (2017b) find
that a basic income at current social expenditure levels
would be likely to fall below the poverty line of a single
person, thus having a limited impact on poverty reduction. Questions about coverage, benefit adequacy,
affordability and financing modalities, as well as the
benefits and services that are kept along with a UBI
need to be further explored so that a basic income can
fulfil its intended purposes.
This vibrant debate on UBI strikes a chord with
many who are concerned about the increased economic and social insecurity, growing inequalities and
huge gaps in social protection coverage for the majority of the world’s population. In fact, the resurgence

of the UBI debate reaffirms the necessity and importance of providing every member of society with at least
the minimum level of income security essential to the
realization of human dignity. The positive effects attributed to UBI reflect some of the fundamental principles of social security: providing at least a basic level
of income security for all, in a way that protects and
promotes human dignity and allows people the breathing space to engage in meaningful and decent work and
to care for their families (ILO, 2012a; Behrendt et al.,
forthcoming).
These principles are also at the core of social protection floors, as defined by ILO Recommendation
No. 202. It is therefore not surprising that the UN
Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human
Rights has noted that a UBI would not be at odds with
the social protection floor concept (UN, 2017d). A nationally defined social protection floor guarantees at
least a basic level of income security throughout the life
cycle, which should allow life in dignity. Some governments may decide to realize the income security component of their social protection floor through UBI;
others may prefer to provide such guarantees through
other means, such as (other) universal benefit schemes,
social insurance schemes, social assistance schemes,
negative income tax, public employment or employment support schemes, in cash or in kind. It should
also be noted that Recommendation No. 202 reaches
beyond a basic level of income security, emphasizing
effective access to health care and other social services,
and highlighting the need to achieve higher levels of
social protection in line with Convention No. 102 and
other ILO social security standards. While UBI may
contribute to closing coverage gaps, its financial, economic and political feasibility poses important challenges. However, many governments have already
implemented universal benefit schemes for certain subgroups of the population. For example, tax-financed
universal old-age pensions and child family benefits essentially constitute a basic income for older persons and
children. In countries where such schemes are already
implemented, they have been very effective in filling
coverage gaps in social security systems and ensuring
at least a basic level of income security at a manageable
cost.
Universal coverage can also be achieved through the
combination of contribution- and tax-financed benefits. Strengthening tax-financed components within
a broader social protection system can contribute to
closing coverage gaps and ensuring at least a basic level
of protection. However, in order to fully meet people’s

social security needs, contributory schemes will continue to play a key role in ensuring wider scope and
higher levels of protection to as many people as possible,
as set out in Recommendation No. 202. The combination of contributory and non-contributory schemes
is essential in building a comprehensive social security
system with a strong floor of social protection. Further efforts are required so that social protection mechanisms will continue to serve as an instrument to ensure
social solidarity, based on the principles of risk pooling
and equity in regard to both financing and benefits. In
this context, it is crucial to consider the combination of
different mechanisms, appropriately financed through
taxes or contributions, to guarantee adequate protection and coverage (ILO, 2016b).
7.2.6 Short-term austerity setbacks
At the beginning of the global crisis, social protection
played a strong role in the expansionary response in a
first phase (2008–09), when 137 countries (or 73 per
cent of the world total) ramped up public expenditures,
and about 50 high- and middle-income countries announced fiscal stimulus packages totalling US$2.4 trillion, of which approximately a quarter was invested in
countercyclical social protection measures.
By 2010, however, premature budget cuts had become
widespread, despite the urgent need of vulnerable

populations for public support, starting the second
phase of the crisis (figure 7.6). In 2016, a major austerity shock of expenditure contraction was initiated
globally and is expected to last at least until 2020. In
2018, 124 countries – 81 of them developing countries – will be adjusting expenditures in terms of GDP;
the number is expected to rise slightly in 2020. This
short-term adjustment process is expected to affect
more than 6 billion persons or nearly 80 per cent of the
global population. Further, 30 per cent of countries in
the world are undergoing excessive fiscal contraction,
defined as cutting public expenditures below pre-crisis
levels, including countries with high developmental
needs such as Angola, Eritrea, Iraq, Sudan and Yemen
(Ortiz, Cummins and Karunanethy, 2017).
These short-term adjustments are affecting a number
of public expenditures, among them social protection
spending. Many have questioned whether the timing,
scope and magnitude of the current fiscal consolidation
trend are conducive to socio-economic recovery. This is
well documented for high-income countries that have
already reduced a range of social protection benefits.
Together with persistent unemployment, lower wages
and higher taxes, these measures have contributed to
increases in poverty, now affecting 86 million people
in the European Union,9 representing more than 17 per
cent of the population, many of them children, women
and persons with disabilities. The number of children
in Europe living in poverty and social exclusion grew

transfers.

by 467,000 from 2007 to 2014 (Cantillon et al., 2017;
Eurostat, 2017). The ILO estimates that future oldage pensioners will receive lower pensions in at least
14 European countries (ILO, 2014a). Several national
courts have found the cuts to be unconstitutional. The
achievements of the European social model, which dramatically reduced poverty and promoted prosperity
and social cohesion in the period following the Second
World War, have been eroded by these short-term adjustment reforms. Further, depressed household income
levels are leading to lower domestic consumption and
lower demand, slowing down recovery.10
Fiscal consolidation is not limited to Europe; many
developing countries are also considering the adjustment measures presented in table 7.1, including the
following:
• Eliminating or reducing subsidies. Overall, 132 governments in 97 developing and 35 high-income
countries are reducing subsidies, predominately on
fuel, but also on electricity, food and agriculture.
This policy is particularly prevalent in the Middle
East and Northern Africa, as well as in sub-Saharan
Africa. When basic subsidies are withdrawn, food
and transport prices rise and can become unaffordable for many households. This net welfare loss has
led to protests and riots in many countries.11 Higher
energy prices also tend to slow down economic

10

activity and thus generate unemployment. This is why
the elimination of subsidies has often been accompanied by the development of a safety net as a way of
compensating the poor; however, targeting only the
poorest is insufficient as it does not compensate vulnerable low- and middle-income households. While
reducing subsidies is a good opportunity to gain
fiscal space, it is important that the large cost savings resulting from reductions in subsidies are used
to develop comprehensive social protection systems,
including floors, to support the SDGs (box 7.2).
• Wage bill cuts/caps. Because recurrent expenditures
such as the salaries of teachers, health staff, social
workers and local civil servants tend to be the largest component of national budgets, an estimated
130 governments in 96 developing and 34 highincome countries are considering cutting or capping
the wage bill, often as part of civil service reforms.
This policy stance may translate into salaries being
reduced or eroded in real value, payments in arrears,
hiring freezes and/or employment retrenchment, all
of which can adversely impact the delivery of public
services to the population (Cornia, Jolly and Stewart, 1987; Chai, Ortiz and Sire, 2010).
• Rationalizing and targeting social protection benefits. Overall, 107 governments in 68 developing and 39 high-income countries are considering

For an analysis and discussion, see ILO, 2014a.
In recent years, protests over food prices have erupted in many countries, including Algeria, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Egypt, India, Iraq,
Jordan, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, Uganda and Yemen (Ortiz et al., 2015). Box 7.2 presents
information on riots and protests over the removal of energy subsidies. Careful analysis of the social impacts prior to the removal of food
and other subsidies is thus a key lesson to avoid generating further poverty and jeopardizing long-term human development.
11

7. Monitoring progress in social protection: Global outlook

Box 7.2 Lessons from using energy subsidies for social protection systems
Since 2010, reducing energy subsidies has been a
common policy considered by governments in 132
countries. The reduction of fuel subsidies is often
accompanied by the development of a basic safety
net as a way of compensating the poor, as in Angola,
Ghana and Indonesia. But when fuel subsidies are
withdrawn, food and transport prices increase and
can become unaffordable for many households;
higher energy prices also tend to slow down economic activity and thus generate unemployment. The
sudden removal of energy subsidies and consequent
increases in prices have sparked protests and violent
riots in many countries, such as Cameroon, Chile,
India, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Mozambique,
Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Peru, Sudan and Uganda.
There are several important policy implications that
must be taken into account:
Timing. While subsidies can be removed overnight,
developing social protection programmes takes a
long time, particularly in countries where institutional capacity is limited. Thus there is a high risk
that subsidies will be withdrawn and populations
will be left unprotected, making food, energy and
transport costs unaffordable for many households.
Targeting the poor excludes other vulnerable
households. In most developing countries, the
“middle classes” have low incomes and are vulnerable to price increases, meaning that a policy to
remove subsidies allowing only targeted safety nets
for the poor may punish the middle classes and lowincome groups.

Allocation of cost savings. The large cost savings
resulting from reductions in energy subsidies should
allow countries to develop comprehensive social
protection systems: fuel subsidies are large, but
compensatory safety nets tend to be small in scope
and cost. For example, in Ghana the eliminated fuel
subsidy would have cost over US$1 billion in 2013,
whereas the targeted social protection LEAP programme costs only about US$20 million per year, a
small fraction of the total savings. Policy discussions
contained in IMF country reports on Angola focus
on reducing fuel subsidies that benefit all Angolans
and instead introduce “a well-targeted conditional
cash transfer (CCT) scheme to protect the less fortunate with a subsidy amount of 50 percent of the
poverty line [that] would cost on an annual basis
around ½ percent of GDP, one eighth of the current
level of spending on fuel subsidies” (IMF, 2014b,
pp. 10 –11) – a lost opportunity to build a much
needed social protection system for all in Angola.
Subsidy reforms are complex and their social impacts
need to be properly assessed and discussed within
the framework of national dialogue, so that the net
welfare effects are understood and reforms are agreed
to before subsidies are scaled back or removed.
The reduction of energy subsidies is a good opportunity to develop social protection systems for
all, including floors, and other SDGs. Fuel subsidies
are generally large and should allow governments to
develop comprehensive universal social protection
systems for all citizens, not just the poor.

Sources: ILO, 2016p; IMF, 2014b; Ortiz et al., 2015.

rationalizing their spending on welfare by revising
eligibility criteria and targeting to the poorest, often
reducing social protection coverage, as presented in
different chapters in this report. Narrow-targeting
to the poor risks excluding large numbers of vulnerable and low-income households. In most developing countries, targeting to the poor increases the
vulnerability of the “middle classes” – the majority of whom earn very low incomes – along with
those just above official poverty lines (Cummins et
al., 2013). Rather than targeting and scaling down
social protection to achieve cost savings over the
short term, there is a strong case for scaling up in
times of crisis and building social protection systems for all.
• Reforming old-age pensions. As many as 105 governments in 60 developing and 45 high-income countries are discussing changes to their pension systems
such as reducing employers’ contribution rates,

increasing eligibility periods, raising the retirement
age and lowering benefits, sometimes with structural reform of contributory social security pensions. As a result, future pensioners are expected to
receive lower benefits, as presented in Chapter 4 and
other sections of this report.
• Labour reforms are being discussed by 89 governments in 49 developing and 40 high-income countries. Related reforms generally include revising
the minimum wage, limiting salary adjustments to
cost-of-living benchmarks, decentralizing and weakening collective bargaining, easing retrenchment
and flexibilizing employment protection procedures (ILO, 2012d). Labour market reforms are supposedly aimed at increasing competitiveness and
supporting businesses during recessions, partially
intending to compensate for the underperformance
of the financial sector. The available evidence suggests, however, that many of these labour reforms

183

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

will not generate decent jobs; on the contrary, in
a context of economic contraction they are likely
to generate labour market “precarization”, depress
domestic incomes and ultimately hinder recovery
efforts. Women workers are particularly hard hit by
such measures (van der Hoeven, 2010; Ghosh, 2013;
Berg, 2015a; Jaumotte and Osorio Buitron, 2015).
• Reforming health systems. Overall, 56 governments
in 34 developing and 22 high-income countries are
discussing reforms to their health-care systems, generally through increasing fees and co-payments as
well as introducing cost-saving measures in public
health centres, as presented in Chapter 5. Lower
quality and availability of health service provision
have led to worse health outcomes (Karanikolos et
al., 2013; Kentikelenis, 2017).

184

• A number of governments are also considering revenue-side measures such as privatizations and, most
frequently, raising consumption taxes or VAT, including on basic products that are consumed by all
households including the poor – hence, a regressive
policy.
United Nations agencies have pointed out the negative social and economic impacts of austerity or fiscal
consolidation (UN, 2012; ILO, 2014a; UNCTAD,
2011, 2016, 2017). Wage restraint and fiscal austerity in
most developed economies have lowered global aggregate demand, negatively affecting the developing world.
Projections using the UN Global Policy Model indicate
that the now generalized spending cuts will negatively
affect global GDP, estimated to be 5.5 per cent lower by
2020 and resulting in the loss of millions of jobs (Ortiz
et al., 2015).
These short-term adjustment measures must be additionally questioned in terms of their high human cost
and the fact that they are not conducive to the achievement of the SDGs. Ill-designed fiscal consolidation
measures threaten not only the human right to social security, but also the rights to food, health, education, and
other essential goods and services (UN, 2011; OHCHR,
2012a; Ortiz and Cummins, 2012; UN Women, 2015).
Fiscal consolidation policies are driven by a cost-saving
logic, and their negative social impacts on women, children, older persons, the unemployed, immigrants or
persons with disabilities, are viewed as collateral damage
in the quest for fiscal balance and debt service (CESR,

2012; Seguino, 2009). The UN High Commissioner
for Human Rights has warned that “austerity measures endanger social protection schemes, including pensions, thereby dramatically affecting the enjoyment of
the rights to social security and to an adequate standard of living” (OHCHR, 2013, para. 13), particularly
for vulnerable and marginalized groups, pointing to
States’ obligation to safeguard human rights, as well
as the obligation to ensure the satisfaction, at the very
least, of minimum essential levels of all economic, social
and cultural rights, including the right to social security
(OHCHR, 2013, esp. paras 36–71).
Alternatives to these short-term reforms, from pensions to health, are presented in different chapters of
this report. It does not need to be a decade of adjustment and budget cuts. Many countries softened their
policy stance in 2012–15, as shown in figure 7.6; and
most middle-income countries are boldly expanding
their social protection systems, a powerful development
lesson. Further, as presented in the next section on fiscal
space, there is national capacity to fund social protection in virtually all countries, even the poorest. Instead
of short-term austerity cuts, policy-makers should consider a wide variety of alternative options to expand
fiscal space and generate resources for social protection.
7.2.7 Fiscal space for social protection exists
even in the poorest countries
Today, at a time of fragile global recovery, fiscal consolidation and slow growth, the need to create fiscal space
has never been greater. Funding has been at the heart
of ILO tripartite discussions since 2011. The Managing Director of the IMF has repeatedly called for aggressive exploration of all possible measures that could
be effective in supporting growth and development,
making the best possible use of fiscal space.12 Given the
significance of social protection for human development and the SDGs, it is indeed imperative that governments explore all possible means of expanding fiscal
space to promote the SDGs and national development
through jobs and social protection.
There is a wide variety of options to expand fiscal
space and generate resources for social protection, even
in the poorest countries. Specifically, there are eight financing options, all supported by policy statements of
the international financial institutions and the United

7. Monitoring progress in social protection: Global outlook

Nations. They are described in full in joint work by
ILO, UNICEF and UN Women (Ortiz, Cummins
and Karunanethy, 2017) which presents multiple examples of governments around the world having applied these options for decades. These eight options to
expand fiscal space are:
1. Reallocating public expenditures. This is the most
orthodox approach; it includes assessing ongoing
budget allocations through public expenditure reviews, social budgeting and other types of budget
analyses; replacing high-cost, low-impact investments with those with larger socio-economic impacts; eliminating spending inefficiencies; and/or
tackling corruption. For example, Costa Rica and
Thailand have reallocated military expenditures to
universal health; Ghana, Indonesia and many other
developing countries have reduced or eliminated
fuel subsidies and used the proceeds to extend social
protection programmes (Duran-Valverde and Pacheco, 2012; ILO, 2016p).
2. Increasing tax revenues. This is clearly the principal
channel for generating resources. It is achieved by altering different types of tax rates – e.g. on consumption, corporate profits, financial activities, property,
imports/exports, natural resources – or by strengthening the efficiency of tax collection methods and
overall compliance. It is useful to analyse the incidence of taxes and transfers on social protection
(Bastagli, 2016). Many countries are increasing taxes
for social protection: for example, the Plurinational
State of Bolivia, Mongolia and Zambia are financing
universal pensions, child benefits and other schemes
from mining and gas taxes (ILO, 2016s); Ghana,
Liberia and the Maldives have introduced taxes on
tourism to support social programmes; Gabon has
used revenues from VAT on mobile communications
to finance its universal health-care system; Algeria,
Mauritius and Panama, among others, have complemented social security revenues with high taxes
on tobacco; and Brazil has introduced a temporary
tax on financial transactions to expand social protection coverage (ILO, 2016t). Other countries have
launched lotteries to supplement social security
spending (e.g. China’s Welfare Lottery or Spain’s
ONCE Lottery for the social inclusion of the blind).
3. Expanding social security coverage and contributory
revenues. This is traditionally the way social insurance is financed (Cichon et al., 2004). Increasing
coverage and therefore collection of contributions
is a reliable way to finance social protection, freeing

fiscal space for other social expenditures. Social
protection benefits linked to employment-based
contributions also encourage formalization of the
informal economy: a remarkable example can be
found in Uruguay’s monotax (ILO, 2014g). Argentina, Brazil, Tunisia and many other countries have
demonstrated the possibility of broadening both
coverage and contributions.
4. Lobbying for aid and transfers. This requires either
engaging with the various donor governments or
international organizations in order to increase
North–South or South–South transfers. Despite
being much smaller than traditional volumes of official development assistance (ODA), bilateral (e.g.
from China) and regional South–South transfers
can also support social investments and warrant
attention. In the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of
the Third International Conference on Financing
for Development (2015), the world’s governments
agreed to address this challenge, at least in part,
through a “new social compact” whereby they agreed
to provide “fiscally sustainable and nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all,
including floors” (UN 2015e, p. 6). Member States
also committed to “strong international support for
these efforts” and to explore “coherent funding modalities to mobilize additional resources” (ibid.).
5. Eliminating illicit financial flows. Estimated at more
than ten times the size of all ODA received, a colossal amount of resources illegally escapes developing
countries each year. To date, little progress has been
achieved, but policy-makers should devote greater
attention to cracking down on money laundering,
bribery, tax evasion, trade mispricing and other financial crimes that are both illegal and deprive governments of revenues needed for social protection
and the SDGs.
6. Using fiscal and central bank foreign exchange reserves. This includes drawing down fiscal savings and
other state revenues stored in special funds, such as
sovereign wealth funds, and/or using excess foreign
exchange reserves in the central bank for domestic
and regional development. Chile, Norway and the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, among others, are
tapping into fiscal reserves for social investments;
Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global is perhaps the best-known case.
7. Managing debt: borrowing or restructuring existing
debt. This involves active exploration of domestic

185

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

and foreign borrowing options at low cost, including concessional, following careful assessment of
debt sustainability. For example, in 2017 Colombia
launched the first Social Impact Bond in developing
countries, and South Africa issued municipal bonds
to finance basic services and urban infrastructure
to redress financing imbalances after the apartheid
regime. For countries in high debt distress, restructuring existing debt may be possible and justifiable
if the legitimacy of the debt is questionable and/
or the opportunity cost in terms of worsening the
deprivation of vulnerable groups is high. In recent
years, more than 60 countries have successfully renegotiated debt and over 20 (e.g. Ecuador and Iceland) have defaulted on or repudiated public debt,
directing debt servicing savings to social protection
programmes (ILO, 2016u).

186

8. Adopting a more accommodating macroeconomic
framework. This entails permitting higher budget
deficit paths and/or higher levels of inflation without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability. A significant number of developing countries used deficit
spending and more accommodating macroeconomic frameworks during the global recession to
attend to pressing demands at a time of low growth
and to support socio-economic recovery.
Each country is unique, and all options should be carefully examined, including the potential risks and tradeoffs, and should be considered in national dialogue.
National tripartite dialogue with government, employers and workers as well as civil society, academia,
United Nations agencies and others, is fundamental in
generating the political will to exploit all possible fiscal
space options in a country and adopt the optimal mix
of public policies for inclusive growth and social protection. Often carried out under UN-led assessment-based
national dialogue (known by its abbreviation, ABND),
national social dialogue is best to articulate optimal solutions in macroeconomic and fiscal policy, the need for
social protection and investments in the SDGs.
7.2.8 Social protection for migrants
Migratory movements have been growing and diversifying over the past decades. The division between sending and destination countries is blurring; South–South

migration flows have substantially increased, although
the highest numbers of migrants are still to be found
in high-income countries (ILO, 2015g). The ILO estimates that among the approximately 244 million migrants in the world (UN, 2015c), 150.3 million are
migrant workers.
One of the major challenges people face when migrating is access to social protection, including health
protection. Restrictive legislation and administrative
regulations may limit migrants’ access to social protection, often due to a lack of coordination between
countries to ensure portability of rights and benefits.
Furthermore, their legal access to social protection may
not always translate into effective access, due to linguistic or other practical obstacles. Workers in the informal
economy in their host country, as in their country of
origin, are not recognized or protected by law and are
more likely to suffer from poor working conditions, exploitation, discrimination and a lack of representation,
often resulting in increased poverty, irregular migration and a lack of social protection. Women, who make
up 44.3 per cent of the total estimated migrant stock
(ILO, 2015g), face particular risks, for example in areas
of domestic work.
Decent work deficits and economic hardship are
among the key drivers of migration. Strengthening
social security systems, including floors, will therefore
not only reduce vulnerabilities and social exclusion and
contribute to economic and social development, but
will also address one of the root causes of migration.
The role and impact of decent work (including social
protection) and of orderly, safe and responsible migration on sustainable development have been widely recognized, and are reflected in SDGs 8.8 and 10.7.
An ILO mapping indicates that out of 120 countries, 70 (58 per cent) have legal provisions granting
equality of treatment with regard to contributory
social security for all branches (except access to health
care); 73 countries have provisions granting equality of
treatment with regard to access to health care and 105
with regard to employment injury. Out of 120 countries, 26 were found to have no bilateral agreements
and 43 had no multilateral agreements. Among those
countries with bilateral agreements, only eight had
more than 20 agreements (van Panhuys, Kazi-Aoul and
­Binette, 2017).13
Recognizing the specific disadvantages that migrants face, ILO Conventions and Recommendations

13
The mapping is limited to legal coverage and does not indicate whether the agreements or provisions are effectively implemented.
In addition, bilateral agreements often focus on only a few branches (in particular, old age).

7. Monitoring progress in social protection: Global outlook

provide an international legal framework for the protection of migrant workers’ social security rights according to basic principles including: equality of treatment;
maintenance of acquired rights and payment of benefits abroad (or “portability”); determination of the applicable legislation; maintenance of rights in the course
of acquisition (or “totalization”); and administrative
assistance. They also call for the extension of social
protection and the conclusion of bilateral/multilateral
agreements. Recent developments in the world have explicitly highlighted the importance of social protection
for migrants and renewed the call for enhanced social
protection access and portability.14
Clearly, more needs to be done to ensure migrants’
access to social protection. Policy options include:
(1) the ratification and application of ILO Conventions
and Recommendations; (2) the conclusion of social security agreements (bilateral/multilateral) treaties to
ensure equality of treatment and portability of social
protection,15 or their extension to cover groups such
as self-employed and domestic workers; (3) the inclusion of social security provisions in labour agreements;16
(4) the strengthening of national social security systems
including social protection floors for all, including for
migrants and their families; (5) other unilateral measures, including the provision of equality of treatment
and payment of benefits abroad, voluntary/mandatory
access to national insurance schemes, welfare funds for
nationals working abroad, and measures supporting
formalization or regularization; and (6) complementary
measures aimed at addressing practical obstacles, such
as, among others, communication campaigns, social
and legal services, pre-departure briefings and materials
in relevant languages.
Although moving forward may not be easy, interand intra-regional dialogue, tripartite consultations,
strengthened institutional capacities, and better data
and information technologies are required to develop
and implement policies that will result, at the end of
the day, in effective access to social protection for all,
nationals and migrants alike.

7.2.9 Building social protection systems
in crisis and fragile contexts
By 2018, most of the world’s extremely poor and approximately 30 per cent of the world’s children will live
in States affected by fragility. An increasing number of
countries or regions around the world are experiencing
such situations, which pose significant challenges for
the expansion or even the maintenance of social protection rights. Even a single shock can erase years of
progress, as experienced during the Ebola crisis in West
Africa (see box 7.3).
Fragile situations highlight the need for greater
coordination among emergency relief interventions
and efforts over the longer term to support the development of sustainable social protection institutions.
Comprehensive social protection systems, including
social protection floors, can be designed as part of national disaster preparedness strategies, and can provide
an effective mechanism with which countries can respond to protection needs in the wake of shocks.17 The
ILO works with humanitarian partners within the UN
system through a framework aimed at supporting the
construction of social protection systems in crisis and
fragile contexts to overcome and prevent further crisis,
based on the following:
• Leveraging existing social protection systems in postshock relief efforts. In countries with an existing
social protection system, the available schemes and
programmes can be used to distribute cash and inkind relief to affected populations; external support channelled through the existing system can
also be used to transfer new technologies and upgrade capacities.
• Supporting the development of a sustainable national
social protection system progressively institutionalized
by government. Following a crisis, immediate relief
efforts may result in disparate programmes being
sponsored by several international donors; better
coordination can create the foundations of a sustainable, nationally owned social protection system
eventually operated by the government.

For example, the International Labour Conference Resolution concerning fair and effective labour migration governance (ILO, 2017g),
the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (2016) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (UN, 2015e) which also proposes that
governments broaden and diversify the tax base. Social security contributions and taxes from migrants can fulfil this purpose while also
strengthening social security systems’ financial sustainability and the spreading of risks (Hagen-Zanker, Mosler Vidal and Sturge, 2017).
15
The Maintenance of Social Security Rights Recommendation, 1983 (No. 167), provides a model social security agreement.
16
The Migration for Employment Recommendation, 1949 (No. 86), provides a model labour agreement.
17
The important role of social protection in this respect is also reflected in the recently adopted ILO Employment and Decent Work for
Peace and Resilience Recommendation, 2017 (No. 205).

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Box 7.3 Recovering from the Ebola crisis
The 2014–16 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa
highlighted weaknesses and underfunding both in
the health systems in West Africa and in the global
surveillance for identifying and rapidly neutralizing
pandemics. Several factors contributed to accelerating the transmission of the Ebola virus or to
slowing the response, including: weakness of the
national health systems; poor citizen access to basic
services such as water, sanitation, health care and
social protection; unsafe practice of some traditional rites; over-centralized governance and weak
accountability systems; and delays in the international response. In West Africa, what began as a
health crisis quickly escalated into a humanitarian,
social and security crisis. In response to a call
by the United Nations Secretary-General and the
Governments of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone,

a multi-agency task force including the ILO was set
up for Ebola recovery, in consultation with a range of
partners including the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union.
This task force contributed towards the short-, medium- and long-term recovery solutions, while the
medical emergency response continued to tackle
the epidemic. In March 2016, the World Health
Organization terminated the public health emergency that had led to an estimated 28,652 Ebola
cases and 11,325 deaths. Efforts to build public
health systems in West Africa continue with the support of development partners, as formulated in the
national Ebola recovery strategies in Guinea, Liberia
and Sierra Leone, including increasing their capacity
and resilience to respond quickly to possible future
health crises.

• Adapting existing social protection systems to increase
their capacity and resilience to respond quickly and
adequately to future shocks. In countries at regular
risk of natural disasters and other types of crisis, the
development and use of contingency plans that can
respond quickly and adequately to adverse events
can reduce delays and increase the efficiency of domestically driven responses; this includes the capacity to provide additional and complementary
benefits to those most affected, or the ability to efficiently extend coverage to new beneficiaries.
• Extension of social protection or services to forcibly displaced populations. One unfortunate feature of many
crises and fragile contexts is that of forced displacement; in 2015, more than 65 million people were
either refugees or seeking asylum abroad, or else displaced within their own countries. Several agencies and NGOs regularly lead response efforts and
provide humanitarian assistance to displaced populations; this addresses the most immediate needs,
but when coupled with other forms of support, it
may also yield more sustainable solutions. Many of
the world’s refugees are spending longer and longer
periods of time in exile during what are more often
protracted crises; this is sparking a debate about the
need for longer-term policy responses that might include complementing emergency services with other
forms of support, including skills development and
participation in selected national social protection
programmes.

7.2.10 Strengthening the environmental dimension
Higher temperatures and sea levels, drought, flooding
and other effects of climate change can pose significant
threats to individual livelihoods and national economies. Whether recurrent or isolated, the need to protect people from the effects of climate-related weather
events is of primary concern for developed and developing countries alike, as is tackling the root causes.
Climate change mitigation measures, including
efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, can
create new “green” sectors of the economy. The ILO
estimates that 15–60 million new jobs could be created
by 2030 through efforts to reduce carbon emissions and
improve energy and resource efficiency. But those whose
livelihoods depend on less environmentally friendly
practices will require support, including social protection, as countries make difficult choices to phase out
polluting or otherwise unsustainable industries. Measures to re-skill workers and protect those who lose their
jobs or other means of livelihood will be necessary to
ensure a “just transition” to greener economies and societies. References to the need for a just transition appear
in the Paris Climate Accord adopted in December 2015
by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The ILO, through tripartite negotiations, has also developed a set of guidelines
to ensure that structural transitions toward greater sustainability are socially equitable (ILO, 2015h).
The role of social protection in the fight against
climate change is twofold. First, social protection can
be used to protect populations at increased risk of

7. Monitoring progress in social protection: Global outlook

climate-related hardship. Social protection benefits such
as cash or in-kind transfers and employment guarantee
schemes can help households affected by extreme weather
events or by slow-onset environmental degradation
linked to climate change. Many countries are adapting existing programmes or designing new ones to provide climate-responsive social protection for households
at risk. For example, in the Philippines, after Typhoon
Haiyan made landfall in 2013, the Government used a
pre-existing employment guarantee scheme to provide
income-earning opportunities for poorer households.
With support from the ILO and local governments, programme participants were affiliated to state-run social
protection schemes for health and employment injury
(ILO and AFD, 2016a). In Ethiopia, the Productive
Safety Net Programme (PSNP) provides regular cash
transfers for chronic deprivation, but has added a variable top-up payment where payout is linked to a weather
index; when precipitation in a given area dips below a set
figure, a top-up payment is activated to help residents
cope with recurrent droughts (ILO and AFD, 2016b).
In the United States, following hurricane Katrina in
2005, the benefit ceiling was raised for affected residents
already enrolled in a food safety net programme. Enrolment of new participants was also facilitated, reducing the supporting identity and wage documentation
required, as part of predefined emergency protocols activated to leverage the programme for crisis response. In
each case, having some basis of social protection measures in place before an event occurs is beneficial for expediting relief, and is more cost-efficient than response
efforts designed and implemented only after the shock.
The second aspect of social protection relevant to
climate change is that it is a tool that can be used to
protect individuals and households who are negatively
affected by proactive efforts made by governments to
move away from polluting practices and industries.
Many countries have made commitments to reduce their
GHG emissions, including in their Intended Nationally
Determined Contributions (INDCs) made to the 21st
Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 21).
Adopting cleaner energy policies, including the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, conserving forests and
closing down carbon-intensive industries are just some
of the many actions that countries are pursuing.
While effective at reducing GHGs, some pro-climate policies will inevitably have negative impacts on
workers or other segments of the population whose
livelihoods are tied to unsustainable practices. Social
18

protection provision, including unemployment benefits,
cash and in-kind transfers, can help those who lose their
jobs, encounter new restrictions on their livelihood activities or face higher prices for their essential fossil fuel
needs. Coupling these pro-climate reforms with social
protection measures to offset negative social impacts is
also practical, as policy-makers often rely upon the compliance of individuals and communities to ensure the
successful implementation of reforms.
Many countries have already combined pro-climate
reforms with social protection measures to offset the
anticipated negative social or economic consequences.
For example, China has closed many logging operations
and enacted land use restrictions to reforest large swaths
of the Yellow and Yangtze River basins. Unemployment benefits and services were extended to affected
workers and cash transfers were established for residents
to discourage land clearing for agriculture use and promote conservation activities (ILO and AFD, 2016c). In
Brazil, the Bolsa Verde programme targets ultra-poor
households living in protected conservation areas, providing a cash transfer top-up that links the additional
income support with sustainable enterprise training
and forest conservation activity (ILO and AFD, 2016d;
Schwarzer, van Panhuys and Diekmann, 2016).

7.3 A global partnership
for universal social protection
The objective of building social protection systems,
including floors, can only be achieved through concerted efforts at the national and international levels,
including through joint efforts of the United Nations
agencies, and with relevant international, regional, subregional and national institutions and social partners.
At the country level, multi-stakeholder teams have
been established since 2009 to contribute through national dialogue on social protection to the development
of national social protection strategies and the practical design and implementation of social protection
floors. They include representatives of various ministries
(labour, health, social welfare, finance, local economic
development, among others), workers’ and employers’
organizations, civil society, the private sector, the UN
system, development banks and development partners. The One-UN Social Protection Floor Initiative
(SPF-I) was created in 2009 by the highest body of the
UN administration, the UN Chief Executive Board;18

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Box 7.4 A multi-stakeholder partnership for SDG 1.3
A global partnership brings together under one
umbrella various net works reflecting dif ferent
stakeholders, based on each partner’s comparative advantage, to contribute to the achievement of
SDG 1.3. The networks are:
• The Social Protection Inter-Agency Cooperation
Board (SPIAC-B), a light inter-agency coordination
mechanism composed of representatives of international organizations and bilateral donors. Cochaired by the ILO and the World Bank, it aims
to enhance global policy coherence and advocacy
on social protection issues and to coordinate international cooperation in country demand-driven actions, and has produced a number of inter-agency
social protection tools (ISPAs). See: http://www.
ilo.org/newyork/issues-at-work/social-protection/
social-protection-inter-agency-cooperation-board/
lang--en/index.htm.
• Working as One UN on social protection floors. This
is an important priority for the UNDG and the ILO,
and mobilizes the collective support of UN agencies and development partners through country
level “One UN” social protection floor teams in
order to design and implement social protection
systems and floors through broad-based national
dialogue under the United Nations Development
Agreement Frameworks (UNDAFs) and SDG implementation plans. Since 2009, regional thematic
working groups operating under UNDG auspices
have been created in the Arab States, Asia and the
Pacific and Europe and Central Asia regions to increase cooperation, develop joint positions, toolkits
and methodologies (ILO and UNDG, 2016) and
promote joint in-country activities on social protection floors. At the global level, “Deliver as One”
on social protection is a role model for the UNDG
(UNDG and ILO, 2014). The UN Development
Operations Coordination Office (UNDOCO) and
a UN Joint Fund on Social Protection Floors will
soon support “Deliver as One” through joint programming. See: http://un.social-protection.org.
• Civil society organizations. The Global Coalition for
Social Protection Floors, led by 80 civil society organizations, supports the right to social protection

190

since then, UN country teams have been working together to develop assessment-based national dialogues
(ABND) to design and implement social protection
systems, including floors, in many countries of Africa,
Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Guidelines

mobilizes workers’ organizations to defend workers’
rights in the context of the establishment of social
protection systems and social security reforms.
See: http://www.social-protection.org/gimi/gess/

Employers. The Global Business Network for
Social Protection Floors is a platform of exchange
and engagement of private sector enterprises.
It promotes the business case for social protection, namely that social protection contributes to
the competitiveness of enterprises by fostering
workers’ productivity, attracting and retaining
talent, and by improving the corporate image of the
enterprises. See: http://www.social-protection.org/
gimi/gess/ShowProject.action?id=3030.
Academia. Partnerships with universities and research centres, notably the International Training
Centre of the ILO (ITCILO) and UN System Staff
College (UNSSC) in Turin, Italy. The ITC delivers
an annual Academy on Social Security providing
executive training courses on the governance, financing, reform and extension of social protection systems, including floors. The ITCILO and the
UNSSC are developing a joint course on social protection for sustainable development in the 2030
Development Agenda. See: http://www.itcilo.org/

Social Protection Floors, and the workers’ Social Protection, Freedom and Justice Initiative. Additionally, the
Global Coalition for Social Protection Floors was created by civil society groups to lobby for a strong Recommendation No. 202; today the coalition has more than
80 NGO members and advocates for SDG 1.3.
Also in 2012, the Social Protection Inter-Agency
Cooperation Board (SPIAC-B) was created, mandated
by the G20 leaders. It is composed of representatives of
international organizations and bilateral donors and
is co-chaired by the ILO and the World Bank. Since
2015, when the SDGs were approved by the UN General Assembly, its members fully support the SDGs related to social protection.
In 2015, in adopting the SDGs world countries
committed to implementing nationally appropriate social protection systems for all, including floors,
for reducing and preventing poverty. The extension of
social protection systems, including floors, is also being
promoted by regional associations such as the African
Union, ASEAN, the BRICS, CARICOM, MERCOSUR, SAARC and SADC, among others.
A universal social protection initiative has been initiated by the ILO and the World Bank with main development partners to support SDG 1.3. As a result, the
Global Partnership for Universal Social Protection was
launched in New York during the 71st UN General Assembly on 21 September 2016, showcasing 23 country

cases as evidence that universal social protection is feasible in developing countries (box 7.4).
A massive international effort has led to the Global
Partnership for Universal Social Protection. Each
of these stakeholders has specific reasons to support
SDG 1.3: governments for reasons related to poverty reduction, economic development and political stability;
workers’ organizations and civil society because social
protection is a human right and contributes to social
justice; employers’ organizations and private sector enterprises because it contributes to the productivity of
workers and the competitiveness of the enterprises; development partners and development banks because
social protection is a driver of fair, inclusive and sustainable development. The UN system promotes “Deliver
as One” on social protection as the most efficient way
to achieve tangible development results in countries.
­Together, these players can achieve marked success.
The fact that millions of people are denied access
to social protection contradicts democratic values and
social justice, damages development efforts, and has
high political costs to governments. The Global Partnership for Universal Social Protection demonstrates
the international community’s determination to rectify this neglect and deepen cooperation. Through the
SDGs, the imperative to provide people with adequate
social protection is strongly embedded across the globe.
It is up to us to make it a reality.

Annex I

Glossary

T

his glossary focuses on the basic concepts, definitions and methodology guiding the analytical work
of the ILO on social security or social protection.1 It
does not set out to assert any universal definitions; its
purpose is rather to simply clarify terms and concepts as
they are used in this report and in the ILO.

Cash transfer programme. Non-contributory
scheme or programme providing cash benefits to individuals or households, usually financed out of taxation,
other government revenue, or external grants or loans.
Cash transfer programmes2 may or may not include a
means test.
Cash transfer programmes that provide cash to families subject to the condition that they fulfil specific
behavioural requirements are referred to as conditional
cash transfer programmes (CCTs). This may mean, for
example, that beneficiaries must ensure their children
attend school regularly, or that they utilize basic preventative nutrition and health-care services.
Contributory scheme. Scheme in which contributions made by protected persons directly determine
entitlement to benefits (acquired rights). The most
common form of contributory social security schemes
is a statutory social insurance scheme, usually covering workers in formal wage employment and, in some

countries, the self-employed. Other common types of
contributory schemes, providing – in the absence of
social insurance – a certain level of protection include
national provident funds, which usually pay a lump sum
to beneficiaries when particular contingencies occur
(typically old age, invalidity or death). In the case of
social insurance schemes for those in waged or salaried
employment, contributions are usually paid by both
employees and employers (though, in general, employment injury schemes are fully financed by employers).
Contributory schemes can be wholly financed through
contributions but are often partly financed from taxation or other sources; this may be done through a subsidy to cover the deficit, or through a general subsidy
supplanting contributions altogether, or by subsidizing only specific groups of contributors or beneficiaries
(e.g. those not contributing because they are caring for
children, studying, in military service or unemployed,
or have too low a level of income to fully contribute, or
receive benefits below a certain threshold because of low
contributions in the past).
Employment guarantee scheme. Public employment programme which provides a guaranteed number
of workdays per year to poor households, generally providing wages at a relatively low level (typically at the
minimum wage level if this is adequately defined).

1
The glossary largely draws on the definitions, concepts and methods provided in the first and second editions of this report (ILO, 2010a;
ILO, 2014a).
2
Strictly speaking, this term would encompass all social transfers provided in cash, including fully or partially contributory transfers, yet it
is usually understood as limited to non-contributory transfers.

193

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

194

Means-tested scheme. A scheme that provides benefits upon proof of need and targets certain categories of
persons or households whose means fall below a certain
threshold, often referred to as social assistance schemes.
A means test is used to assess whether the individual’s
or household’s own resources (income and/or assets)
are below a defined threshold to determine whether
the applicants are eligible for a benefit at all, and if so at
what level benefit will be provided. In some countries,
proxy means tests are used; that is, eligibility is determined without actually assessing income or assets, on
the basis of other household characteristics (proxies)
that are deemed more easily observable. Means-tested
schemes may also include entitlement conditions and
obligations, such as work requirements, participation
in health check-ups or (for children) school attendance.
Some means-tested schemes also include other interventions that are delivered on top of the actual income
transfer itself.
Non-contributory schemes. Non-contributory
schemes, including non-means-tested and means‑tested
schemes, normally require no direct contribution from
beneficiaries or their employers as a condition of entitlement to receive relevant benefits. The term covers a
broad range of schemes, including universal schemes for
all residents (such as national health services), categorical
schemes for certain broad groups of the population (e.g.
for children below a certain age or older persons above
a certain age), and means-tested schemes (such as social
assistance schemes). Non-contributory schemes are usually financed through taxes or other state revenues, or, in
certain cases, through external grants or loans.
Public employment programme. Government programme offering employment opportunities to certain categories of persons who are unable to find other
employment. Public employment programmes include
employment guarantee schemes and “cash for work”
and “food for work” programmes (see box 3.2).
Social assistance scheme/programme. A scheme
that provides benefits to vulnerable groups of the population, especially households living in poverty. Most
social assistance schemes are means-tested.
Social insurance scheme. Contributory social protection scheme that guarantees protection through
an insurance mechanism, based on: (1) the prior payment of contributions, i.e. before the occurrence of
the ­insured contingency; (2) risk- sharing or “pooling”;

and (3) the notion of a guarantee. The contributions
paid by (or for) insured persons are pooled together and
the resulting fund is used to cover the expenses incurred
exclusively by those persons affected by the occurrence
of the relevant (clearly defined) contingency or contingencies. Contrary to commercial insurance, risk-pooling
in social insurance is based on the principle of solidarity
as opposed to individually calculated risk premiums.
Many contributory social security schemes are
presented and described as “insurance” schemes (usually “social insurance schemes”), despite being in actual
fact of mixed character, with some non-contributory
elements in entitlements to benefits; this allows for a
more equitable distribution of benefits, particularly
for those with low incomes and short or broken work
careers, among others. These non-contributory elements take various forms, being financed either by other
contributors (redistribution within the scheme) or by
the State.
Social protection. Social protection, or social security, is a human right and is defined as the set of policies and programmes designed to reduce and prevent
poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion throughout the life cycle. Social protection includes nine main
areas: child and family benefits, maternity protection,
unemployment support, employment injury benefits,
sickness benefits, health protection (medical care), oldage benefits, invalidity/disability benefits, and survivors’
benefits. Social protection systems address all these
policy areas by a mix of contributory schemes (social
insurance) and non‑contributory tax-financed benefits
(including social assistance).
As a human right, social protection, or social security, is enshrined as such in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights (1948), the International Covenant
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966), and in
other major United Nations human rights instruments.
States have the legal obligation to protect and promote
human rights, including the right to social protection,
or social security, and ensure that people can realize
their rights without discrimination. The overall responsibility of the State includes ensuring the due provision
of benefits according to clear and transparent eligibility
criteria and entitlements, and the proper administration of the institutions and services. Where benefits and
services are not provided directly by public institutions,
the effective enforcement of the legislative frameworks
is particularly important for the provision of benefits
and services (CESCR, 2008).
”Social protection” is a current term to refer to
“social security” and generally both terms are used

interchangeably. It must be noted that sometimes the
term “social protection” is used with a wider variety of
meanings than “social security”, including protection
provided between members of the family or members
of a local community; on other occasions it is also used
with a narrower meaning, understood as comprising
only measures addressed to the poorest, most vulnerable or excluded members of society. In the majority of
contexts, however, the two terms, “social security” and
“social protection”, are largely interchangeable, and the
ILO and in general UN institutions use both in discourse with their constituents and in the provision of
relevant advice to them.
Social protection floor. ILO Recommendation
No. 202 sets out that member States should establish
and maintain national social protection floors as a nationally defined set of basic social security guarantees
which secure protection aimed at preventing or alleviating poverty, vulnerability and social exclusion (ILO,
2012a). These guarantees should ensure at a minimum
that, over the life cycle, all in need have access to at least
essential health care and basic income security. These
together ensure effective access to essential goods and
services defined as necessary at the national level. More
specifically, national social protection floors should
comprise at least the following four social security guarantees, as defined at the national level:
(a) access to essential health care, including maternity
care;
(b) basic income security for children;
(c) basic income security for persons in active age who
are unable to earn sufficient income, in particular in
cases of sickness, unemployment, maternity and disability; and
(d) basic income security for older persons.3
Such guarantees should be provided to all residents and
all children, as defined in national laws and regulations,
and subject to existing international obligations.
Recommendation No. 202 also states that basic
social security guarantees should be established by law.
National laws and regulations should specify the range,
qualifying conditions and levels of the benefits giving
effect to these guarantees, and provide for effective and
accessible complaint and appeal procedures.

Recommendation No. 202, Para. 5.

Social protection floors correspond in many ways
to the existing notion of “core obligations”, to ensure
the realization of, at the very least, minimum essential
levels of rights embodied in human rights treaties (UN,
2014; OHCHR, 2013).
Social protection programme/scheme (or social
security programme/scheme). Distinct framework
of rules to provide social protection benefits to entitled
beneficiaries. Such rules would specify the geographical
and personal scope of the programme (target group),
entitlement conditions, the type of benefits, benefit
amounts (cash transfers), periodicity and other benefit
characteristics, as well as the financing (contributions,
general taxation, other sources), governance and administration of the programme.
While “programme” may refer to a wide range of
programmes, the term “scheme” is usually used in a
more specific sense referring to a programme that is anchored in national legislation and characterized by at
least a certain degree of “formality”.
A programme/scheme can be supported by one or
more social security institutions governing the provision of benefits and their financing. It should, in general, be possible to draw up a separate account of receipts
and expenditure for each social protection programme.
It is often the case that a social protection programme
provides protection against a single risk or need, and
covers a single specific group of beneficiaries. Typically,
however, one institution will administer more than one
benefit programme.
Social security. The fundamental right to social
security is set out in the Universal Declaration on
Human Rights (1948) and other international legal instruments. The notion of social security adopted here
covers all measures providing benefits, whether in cash
or in kind, to secure protection, inter alia, from:
• lack of work-related income (or insufficient income)
caused by sickness, disability, maternity, employment injury, unemployment, old age, or death of a
family member;
• lack of (affordable) access to health care;
• insufficient family support, particularly for children
and adult dependants;
• general poverty and social exclusion.

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

196

Social security thus has two main (functional) dimensions, namely “income security” and “availability of
medical care”, reflected in the Declaration of Philadelphia (1944), which forms part of the ILO’s Constitution:
“social security measures to provide a basic income to all
in need of such protection and comprehensive medical
care” (Article III (f)).4 Recommendation No. 202 sets
out that, at least, access to essential health care and basic
income security over the life cycle should be guaranteed
as part of nationally defined social protection floors,
and that higher levels of protection should be progressively achieved by national social security systems in line
with Convention No. 102 and other ILO instruments.
Access to social security is essentially a public responsibility, and is typically provided through public
institutions, financed from either contributions or taxes
or both. However, the delivery of social security can
be and often is mandated to private entities. Moreover,
there exist many privately run institutions (of an insurance, self-help, community-based or mutual character)
which can partially assume selected roles usually played
by social security, such as the operation of occupational
pension schemes, that complement and may largely substitute for elements of public social security schemes.
Entitlements to social security are conditional either
on the payment of social security contributions for
prescribed periods (contributory schemes, most often
structured as social insurance arrangements) or on a
requirement, sometimes described as “residency plus”,
under which benefits are provided to all residents of
the country who also meet certain other criteria (noncontributory schemes). Such criteria may make benefit
entitlements conditional on age, health, labour market
participation, income or other determinants of social or
economic status and/or even conformity with certain
behavioural requirements.
Two main features distinguish social security from
other social arrangements. First, benefits are provided
to beneficiaries without any simultaneous reciprocal obligation (thus it does not, for example, represent remuneration for work or other services delivered). Second,
it is not based on an individual agreement between the
protected person and the provider (as is, for example,

4

a life insurance contract); the agreement applies to a
wider group of people and so has a collective character.
Depending on the category of applicable conditions,
a distinction is also made between non‑means‑tested
schemes (where the conditions of benefit entitlement
are not related to the total level of income or wealth of
the beneficiary and her or his family) and means-tested
schemes (where entitlement is granted only to those
with income or wealth below a prescribed threshold).
A special category of “conditional” schemes includes
those which, in addition to other conditions, require
beneficiaries (and/or their relatives or families) to participate in prescribed public programmes (for example,
specified health or educational programmes).
Social security system/social protection system.
Totality of social security/protection schemes and programmes in a country, taking into account that the latter
term is often used in a broader sense than the former.
All the social security schemes and institutions in a
country are inevitably interlinked and complementary
in their objectives, functions and financing, and thus
form a national social security system. For reasons of
effectiveness and efficiency, it is essential that there is
close coordination within the system, and that – not
least for coordination and planning purposes – the
receipts and expenditure accounts of all the schemes
are compiled into one social security budget for the
country so that its future expenditure and financing of
the schemes comprising the social security system are
planned in an integrated way.
Social transfer. All social security benefits comprise
transfers either in cash or in kind, i.e. they represent
a transfer of income, goods or services (for example,
health-care services). This transfer may be from the
active to the old, the healthy to the sick, or the affluent
to the poor, among others. The recipients of such transfers may be in a position to receive them from a specific
social security scheme because they have contributed
to such a scheme (contributory scheme), or because
they are residents (universal schemes for all residents),
or because they fulfil specific age criteria (categorical

These two main dimensions are also identified in the ILO Income Security Recommendation, 1944 (No. 67), and the Medical Care
Recommendation, 1944 (No. 69), respectively, as “essential element[s] of social security”. These Recommendations envisage that, first,
“income security schemes should relieve want and prevent destitution by restoring, up to a reasonable level, income which is lost by reason
of inability to work (including old age) or to obtain remunerative work or by reason of the death of a breadwinner” (Recommendation
No. 67, Guiding principles, Para. 1); and, second, that “a medical care service should meet the need of the individual for care by members of
the medical and allied professions” and “the medical care service should cover all members of the community” (Recommendation No. 69,
Paras 1 and 8). Recommendation No. 202 also reflects these two elements in the basic social protection guarantees that should form part of
national social protection floors (for more details, see box 1.2).

Annex I. Glossary

schemes), or specific resource conditions (social assistance schemes), or because they fulfil several of these
conditions at the same time. In addition, it is a requirement in some schemes (employment guarantee schemes,
public employment programmes) that beneficiaries accomplish specific tasks or adopt specific behaviours
(conditional cash transfer programmes). In any given
country, several schemes of different types generally coexist and may provide benefits for similar contingencies
to different population groups.
Targeted scheme/programme. See Social assistance
scheme.

Universal scheme/categorical scheme. Strictly
speaking, universal schemes provide benefits under the
single condition of residence. However, the term is also
often used to describe categorical schemes that provide
benefits to certain broad categories of the population
without a means test or a proxy means test. The most
frequent forms of such schemes are those that transfer
income to older persons above a certain age, to all persons with disabilities, or to children below a certain age.
Some categorical schemes also target households with
specific structures (one-parent households, for example)
or occupational groups (such as rural workers). Most
categorical schemes are financed by public resources.

Social protection coverage
Measurement of effective coverage
in SDG indicator 1.3.1
The report provides a comprehensive data set for the
monitoring of SDG indicator 1.3.1 based on the data
compiled through the Social Security Inquiry questionnaire of 2016 together with other data sources (see details
at the end of this Annex). The data set was submitted to
the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) in the
framework of SDG monitoring; in particular, in the
context of SDG 1 (“End poverty in all its forms everywhere”), the ILO is responsible for producing SDG indicator 1.3.1: “Proportion of population covered by social
protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older persons, persons with
disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury
victims, and the poor and the vulnerable.”
The indicator reflects the proportion of persons effectively covered by a social protection system, including social protection floors (see definition of “effective
coverage” and its measurement criteria in the following
section). It covers the main components of social protection: child and maternity benefits, support for persons without a job, persons with disabilities, victims of
work injuries and older persons,1 with an aim of providing at least a basic level in all main contingencies along
the life cycle, as defined in the ILO Social Protection
Floors Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202).
1

Health is included under other SDG indicators.

Calculations include separate indicators to distinguish effective coverage for children, unemployed
persons, older persons and persons with disabilities,
pregnant women and mothers with newborns, workers
protected in case of work injury, and the poor and the
vulnerable. For each case, coverage is expressed as a
share of the respective population group.
Indicators are obtained as follows:
a. Proportion of the population protected in at least one
area: Proportion of the total population receiving
cash benefits under at least one of the contingencies
(contributory or non-contributory benefit) or actively
contributing to at least one social security scheme.
b. Proportion of children covered by social protection
benefits: ratio of children/households receiving child
or family cash benefits to the total number of children/households with children.
c. Proportion of women giving birth covered by maternity benefits: ratio of women receiving cash maternity benefits to women giving birth in the same year
(estimated based on age-specific fertility rates published in the UN’s World Population Prospects or on
the number of live births corrected for the share of
twin and triplet births).
d. Proportion of persons with disabilities receiving benefits: ratio of persons receiving disability cash benefits to persons with severe disabilities. The latter is
calculated as the product of prevalence of disability

199

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

ratios (published for each country group by the
World Health Organization) and each country’s
population.
e. Proportion of unemployed receiving benefits: ratio
of recipients of unemployment cash benefits to the
number of unemployed persons.
f. Proportion of workers covered in case of employment
injury: ratio of workers protected by injury insurance to total employment or the labour force.
g. Proportion of older persons receiving a pension: ratio
of persons above statutory retirement age receiving an old-age pension to persons above statutory retirement age (including contributory and
non-contributory).

200

h. Proportion of vulnerable persons receiving benefits: ratio of social assistance recipients to the total
number of vulnerable persons. The latter are calculated by subtracting from total population all people
of working age who are contributing to a social insurance scheme or receiving contributory benefits,
and all persons above retirement age receiving contributory benefits.
Aggregate coverage indicators
In this report two aggregate measures of coverage are
used; both exclude health for methodological reasons
(for measures of health coverage, see below).
The proportion of the population enjoying comprehensive social security protection is estimated based on the
number of persons of working age who enjoy comprehensive social security coverage, i.e. covered by law in all
eight areas (sickness, unemployment, old age, employment injury, child/family benefit, maternity, invalidity,
survivors) in line with Convention No. 102.
The proportion of the population protected in at
least one area (SDG indicator 1.3.1 (a)), as described
above, reflects effective coverage of the population in
at least one area, that is, the proportion of the population receiving contributory or non-contributory benefits under at least one area or actively contributing to at
least one social security scheme.

Measuring social protection coverage:
Concepts and criteria

General considerations
Measuring social protection coverage is a complex task.
Several dimensions need to be considered in order to
arrive at a complete assessment. In practice, few countries have available the full range of statistical data
necessary for a complete assessment of social security
coverage; nevertheless, partial information is available
for a large number of countries. Many countries have
acknowledged the need to undertake better regular
monitoring of social security coverage and are stepping
up their efforts to improve data collection and analysis.
Social security coverage is a multidimensional concept with at least three dimensions:
• Scope. This is measured here by the range (number)
and type of social security areas (branches) to which
the population of the country has access. Population
groups with differing status in the labour market
may enjoy different scopes of coverage, and this
factor must be taken into account in assessing scope.
• Extent. This usually refers to the percentage of persons covered within the whole population or the
target group (as defined by, for example, gender, age
or labour market status) by social security measures
in each specific area.
• Level. This refers to the adequacy of coverage by a
specific branch of social security. It may be measured by the level of cash benefits provided, where
measurements of benefit levels can be either absolute or relative to selected benchmark values such as
previous incomes, average incomes, the poverty line,
and so on. Measures of quality are usually relative
and may be objective or subjective – for example,
the satisfaction of beneficiaries measured against
their expectations.
In measuring coverage, a distinction is made between
legal coverage2 and effective coverage in each of the
above three dimensions, so as to reflect different dimensions of coverage. Table AII.1 summarizes these
various dimensions.

2
Legal coverage is sometimes referred to as “statutory coverage”, taking into account that provisions may be rooted in
statutory provisions other than laws.

national legislation? What percentage of the population or labour force is covered according to the national legislation?

For a given social security area (branch): which categories of the population enjoy actual access to benefits in case of need (currently or in the
future)?
The “beneficiary coverage ratio”: for a given social security area, what percentage of the population affected by the contingency receives benefits or
services (e.g. percentage of older persons receiving an old-age pension; percentage of unemployed receiving unemployment benefits)?
The “contributor coverage ratio”: for a given social security area, what percentage of the population contributes to the scheme, or is otherwise affiliated to the scheme, and can thus expect to receive benefits when needed
(e.g. percentage of working-age population or of the labour force contributing to a pension scheme)? By extension, the “protected person coverage
ratio” would include people who – assuming that legislation is unchanged
– would be entitled to a non-contributory benefit in the future, either
through a universal scheme, or a means-tested scheme, provided they meet
the eligibility criteria.

Level

For a given social security area: what is the level of protection provided according to the national legislation?
For cash benefits: what is the prescribed amount or
replacement rate according to the national legislation?

For a given social security area: what is the level of protection actually
provided (e.g. for cash benefits, average level of benefit as a proportion of
median income, minimum wage or poverty line)?

For a given group of the population: for which social security areas is this
group effectively covered (benefits are actually available)?

Source: Based on ILO, 2010a.

Legal coverage
Estimates of the scope of legal coverage usually measure the number of social security areas (branches) by
which – according to existing national legislation – a
population or its specific groups are covered. The list of
the nine branches covered by ILO Convention No. 102
is used as guidance.
Estimates of the extent of legal coverage use both information on the groups covered by statutory schemes
for a given social security area (branch) in national
legislation and available statistical information quantifying the number of persons concerned at the national
level. A population group can be identified as legally
covered in a specific social security area (e.g. old age,
unemployment protection, maternity protection) if the
existing legislation sets out that this group is mandatorily covered by social insurance, or that the group will
be entitled to specified non-contributory benefits under
certain circumstances – for instance, to an old-age state
pension on reaching the age of 65, or to income support
if income falls below a specified threshold. A legal coverage ratio for a given branch of social security is the ratio
between the estimated number of people legally covered
and – as appropriate – the total population or labour

force in the relevant age bracket, the total number of
employees (that is, waged and salaried workers) or the
total number of employed persons (including employees
and the self-employed). For example, since Convention
No. 102 allows a ratifying country to provide coverage
through social insurance, through universal or meanstested benefits, or a combination of both, it also formulates alternatives to minimum requirements for the
extent of coverage, as follows: (a) prescribed classes of
employees, constituting not less than 50 per cent of all
employees; or (b) prescribed classes of the economically
active population, constituting not less than 20 per cent
of all residents; or (c) all residents whose means during
the contingency do not exceed prescribed limits.
The level of legal coverage for specific branches of
social security is usually measured (for cash benefits) by
benefit ratios or replacement ratios calculated for specified categories of beneficiaries, using benefit formulas or
benefit amounts specified in the legislation. For example,
Convention No. 102 sets minimum replacement rates for
cash benefits in seven of its nine branches (see tables in
Annex III below). It specifies that such minimum rates
should apply to a defined “standard” beneficiary meeting
qualifying conditions, and be guaranteed at least to those
with earnings up to a certain prescribed selected level.

201

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Effective coverage

202

Measurements of effective coverage should reflect how
the legal provisions are implemented in reality. Effective
coverage is usually different from legal coverage (and
usually lower) because of non‑compliance, problems
with enforcement of legal provisions or other deviations
of actual policies from the text of the legislation. In
order to arrive at a full coverage assessment, measures of
legal and effective coverage need to be used in parallel.
Measurements of the scope of effective coverage in
a country reveal the number of social security areas
(branches) for which there is relevant legislation that is
actually enforced: that is, whether in all such areas the
majority of the population legally covered is also effectively covered (as measured by the extent of effective coverage; see below).
When measuring the extent of effective coverage a
distinction has to be made between coverage measured
in terms of protected persons and in terms of actual beneficiaries. Protected persons are those who have benefits
guaranteed but are not necessarily currently receiving
them – for example, people who actively contribute to
social insurance and are thus guaranteed benefits for a
specified contingency, e.g. an old-age pension on reaching retirement age or people entitled to non-contributory benefits if needed.
In respect of protected persons, the contributor coverage ratio reflects, in the case of contributory schemes,
the number of those protected should they be affected
by the contingency covered now or in the future: that is,
the share of the employed population (or alternatively
the population of working age or in the labour force)
which contributes directly or indirectly to social insurance in a given social security area and is thus likely to
receive benefits when needed. An example is the percentage of employed persons contributing to a pension scheme. The protected person coverage ratio includes
people entitled to non-contributory benefits, assuming
unchanged legislation.
In respect of actual beneficiaries, the beneficiary coverage ratio describes the proportion of the population
affected by a certain contingency (e.g. older persons, the
unemployed) who actually benefit from the appropriate social protection benefits (e.g. old-age pensions, unemployment benefits). This ratio reflects the number of
those actually receiving benefits, such as the number of
beneficiaries of any pension benefits among all residents
over the statutory pensionable age, or the number of
3

Such schemes are also referred to as categorical schemes.

beneficiaries of some kind of income support among all
those unemployed, or all below the poverty line.
Measurements of the level of effective coverage would
identify the levels of benefits (usually related to certain
benchmark amounts) actually received by beneficiaries,
such as unemployment benefits or pensions paid, compared to average earnings or to the minimum wage or
the poverty line. In the case of contributory pension
schemes, the effective level of coverage may also relate
to future benefit levels.
When assessing coverage and gaps in coverage, distinctions need to be made between coverage
by (1) contributory social insurance; (2) universal
schemes covering all residents (or all residents in a given
category);3 and (3) means-tested schemes potentially
covering all those who pass the required test of income
and/or assets. In the case of social insurance it makes
sense to look at the numbers of those who are actually
members of and contributors to such schemes and who
thus potentially enjoy – sometimes with their dependants – coverage in the event of any of the contingencies covered by their social insurance. These people fall
into a category of persons “protected” in the event of
a given contingency. The concept of protected persons
may also apply where people are covered by universal
or categorical programmes if all residents, or all residents in a given category (e.g. age), are entitled to certain benefits or to free access to social services by law
and in practice in the event of the given contingency.
It is, however, rather difficult to specify who is in fact
effectively protected in the case of benefits granted on
the basis of a means test or proxy means test, or conditional cash transfers.
The above measures of extent and level of coverage are specifically applied to certain areas (branches)
of social security (and sometimes even only to specific
schemes or types of scheme); they do not attempt to
provide a generic measure of social security coverage.
Ensuring the specificity of coverage indicators by area
is essential to arrive at a meaningful analysis and ensure
its relevance for policy development.

goods and services, and tax breaks with social purposes. Benefits may
be targeted at low-income households, the elderly, disabled, sick, unemployed, or young persons. To be considered “social”, programmes
have to involve either redistribution of resources across households or
compulsory participation. Social benefits are classified as public when
general government (that is central, state, and local governments, including social security funds) controls the relevant financial flows.
All social benefits not provided by general government are considered

overview of key dimensions of coverage and access to
health care was developed by the ILO (2014a). We use
these data consisting of five indicators reflecting the
affordability, availability and financial protection of
quality health services complemented by information
on health outputs based on maternal mortality rates.
In order to disaggregate the global data new methodologies have been developed to assess rural/urban and
long-term care (LTC) coverage gaps and deficits. To
ensure cross‑country comparability the methods used
are deliberately not country-specific.
The legal coverage of the rural population was estimated by using the percentage of GDP provided by
the agricultural sector. The GDP provided by other sectors allowed estimations of the legal coverage of urban
populations to be made. In countries where the national legal coverage reached values above 99 per cent
or below 1 per cent of the population, rural and urban
disparities were assumed to be the same. Estimating the
staff access deficit, the financial deficit and the maternal mortality ratio of the rural population was based
on skilled birth attendance (SBA) given the high correlation observed. In countries where the national deficit
was zero, no rural or urban deficits were assumed. The
estimates of out‑of‑pocket payments (OOP) of the rural
population were based on World Bank household expenditure data. Since the database is biased towards
low- and middle-income countries, rural and urban
discrepancies in high-income countries were assumed
equal. All assessments of estimates are population (respectively birth) weighted and refer to data provided by
the UN World Population Prospects, the World Bank

(World Development Indicators Database, Global
Consumption Database) and the WHO Global Health
Observatory Data Repository).
As regards the data development for LTC coverage
and access, we used existing international databases and
relevant reports from international organizations including the OECD, WHO, World Bank and ILO in
so far as comparable information on relevant aspects
was covered. In addition, other well‑known databases
were used and a literature search was conducted, for
instance on legislation, LTC policies and provision of
services, and cash benefits. After synthesizing the collected material, national experts, academics, authors,
government representatives and policy-makers from the
selected countries were contacted for quality control.
Further details concerning the methodologies applied are available in Annex IV, table B.13 as well as
in the underlying ILO publications (Scheil-Adlung,
2015a, 2015b).

Social protection expenditure
Data on social protection expenditure are collected according to different standards around the world. Within
the European Union the standard is the ESSPROS
system, while comparable data for other parts of the
world are available through the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics (GFS), either according to the new GFS
2014 standard, or the older GFS 2001 or 1986 standard.

Data on expenditure for this report were obtained
from various sources (see table AII.2 and the section at
the end of this Annex, “Sources of data”).

Global and regional estimates
Regional results for effective and legal coverage indicators are obtained as averages of figures from countries
in each region weighted by the population group concerned. For effective coverage, estimates are based on
administrative data produced by the countries (the ILO
Social Security Inquiry (SSI)). For SDG regions with
insufficient country coverage, imputations were used.

Regional and global estimates were produced in cooperation with the ILO Department of Statistics (see the
methodological details below).
Regional results for expenditure indicators are obtained as averages of figures from countries in each
region weighted by the total GDP of the corresponding
country. The GDP data used was current GDP in US$
according to the World Bank.
Regional and income groupings
The regional and income groupings used are listed in
tables AII.3 and AII.4.

Estimating global and regional aggregates of social
protection indicators: Methodological description
The global and regional estimates presented in this
report are based on econometric models designed to
impute missing data in countries for which nationally
reported data are unavailable. The output of the models
is a complete set of single-year estimates for seven social
protection indicators for 169 countries. The countrylevel data (reported and imputed) are then aggregated
to produce global and regional estimates of the social
protection indicators.

Data coverage
Input data utilized in the model were collected through
the ILO Social Security Inquiry (SSI). The number of
countries for which data were reported for each variable included in the global and regional estimations
is as follows: overall coverage by social protection (at
least one contingency), 72 countries; older persons, 138
countries; persons with severe disabilities, 71 countries;
mothers with newborns, 66 countries; children, 60
countries; unemployed, 75 countries; vulnerable population, 65 countries.

Detailed information on the share of the global and
regional populations for which data were reported to
the ILO through the SSI is provided in table AII.7 for
each indicator. The years of the input data range from
2012 to 2016.

Description of the econometric model
Separate models are run for each social protection indicator for which regional and global aggregates are
generated. For six of the seven indicators (overall coverage, persons with severe disabilities, mothers with
newborns, children, unemployed and vulnerable population), ordinary least squares (OLS) models are utilized, using geographic location and level of income
as the explanatory variables. More specifically, the dependent variable in each model is the proportion of the
population covered under the given social protection
scheme (i) and the independent variables are regional
groupings interacted with income groupings as shown
in equation (1):
Social protection indicatori =
αi + βi (Region × Income Group) + εi

(1)

Annex II. Measuring social protection effective coverage, legal coverage and expenditure

Income groups correspond to quartiles of per capita
GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) based on the
World Development Indicators (WDI) database. Table
AII.5 lists the ten regional groupings used in the regressions and that correspond to regional groupings used in
SDG global and regional monitoring.

* Regional groupings used in the report are based on the ILO classification
(table AII.3), and differ from the regional groupings used for SDG monitoring.

As the old-age coverage indicator has significantly
greater data coverage than the other indicators, simple
regional averages of the reported old-age coverage data
were used to impute values in countries without data.
In the few cases where the OLS estimates were out of
range (<0% or >100% coverage), these were replaced by
simple regional averages.

Method of producing global
and regional aggregates
For each social protection indicator, regional and
global aggregates are produced only if the data reported through the SSI correspond to more than
40 per cent of a given region’s population. Where this
threshold has been satisfied, the regional and global
aggregates are then obtained by weighted averages of
the underlying country-level estimates (reported or imputed). The weights used for each indicator are listed
in table AII.6.

Sources of data
This report is based on the ILO World Social Protection Database, which provides in-depth country-level
statistics on various dimensions of social security or
social protection systems, including key indicators for
policy-makers, officials of international organizations
and researchers, including the United Nations monitoring of the SDGs (UN, 2017b).
Most of the data in the ILO World Social Protection Database are collected through the ILO Social
Security Inquiry (SSI), the ILO’s periodic collection of
administrative data from national ministries of labour,
social security, welfare, social development, finance, and
others ministries. The 2016 edition of the Social Security Inquiry is an update of the earlier questionnaire,
adapted to better reflect the newly adopted SDGs. The
SSI questionnaires and manual are available online
(ILO, 2016c).
For measuring legal coverage, the main source is the
ISSA/SSA Social Security Programs Throughout the
World, used in combination with data on labour force
from ILOSTAT.
Other data sources:
• For indicators of effective coverage: existing global
social protection statistics, including those of
EUROSTAT, the World Bank pensions and ASPIRE
databases, UNICEF, UN Women, HelpAge, OECD
and ISSA.
• For indicators of legal coverage: HelpAge International, and the Mutual Information System on
Social Protection (MISSOC).
• For coverage in health: WHO, Global Health Observatory Data Repository; UN, World Population
Prospects, 2015 revision; World Bank, World Development Indicators and Global Consumption
Database.

Annex II. Measuring social protection effective coverage, legal coverage and expenditure

• For indicators on expenditure: The GDP data used
was current GDP in US$ according to the World
Bank; data on expenditure from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), Eurostat, OECD, UN
Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean (ECLAC), Asian Development Bank
(ADB), Government Spending Watch (GSW),
World Health Organization (WHO) and national
sources such as the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Economics.
• For population and labour market indicators:
­ILOSTAT; UN, World Population Prospects, 2015
revision. Definitions used for these indicators are
available at: Resolution concerning statistics of work,
employment and labour underutilization, 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS),

October 2013. Available at: http://www.ilo.ch/
global/statistics-and-databases/meetings-and-events/
international-conference-of-labour-statisticians/19/
lang--en/index.htm.
• The ILO World Social Protection Database also
draws on national official reports and other sources,
which usually are largely based on administrative
data; and on survey data from a range of sources including national household income and expenditure
surveys, labour force surveys, and demographic and
health surveys, to the extent that these include variables on social protection.
Where new data from the abovementioned sources
were not available, data from previous editions of the
World Social Protection Report were used.

Annex III

Minimum requirements
in ILO social security standards:
Overview tables

ILO

social security standards have come to be
recognized globally as key references for the
design of rights-based, sound and sustainable social
protection schemes and systems. They also give meaning and definition to the content of the right to social
security as laid down in international human rights
instruments (notably the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, 1948, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966),
thereby constituting essential tools for the realization of
this right and the effective implementation of a rightsbased approach to social protection.
Guiding ILO policy and technical advice in the
field of social protection, ILO social security standards
are primarily tools for governments which, in consultation with employers and workers, are seeking to draft
and implement social security law, establish administrative and financial governance frameworks, and develop
social protection policies. More specifically, these standards serve as key references for:
• the elaboration of national social security extension
strategies;

1

• the development and maintenance of comprehensive national social security systems;
• the design and parametric adjustments of social security schemes;
• the establishment and implementation of effective
recourse, enforcement and compliance mechanisms;
• the good governance of social security and improvement of administrative and financial structures;
• the realization of international and regional obligations, and the operationalization of national social
protection strategies and action plans; and
• working towards the achievement of Sustainable
Development Goals, particularly Goals 1, 3, 5, 8,
10 and 16.
The ILO’s normative social security framework consists of eight up-to-date Conventions and nine Recommendations.1 The most prominent of these are
the Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), and the Social Protection Floors

Income Security Recommendation, 1944 (No. 67), Medical Care Recommendation, 1944 (No. 69), Social Security (Minimum
Standards) Convention, 1952 (No. 102), Equality of Treatment (Social Security) Convention, 1962 (No. 118), Employment Injury Benefits
Convention, 1964 (No. 121) and Recommendation, 1964 (No. 121), Invalidity, Old-Age and Survivors’ Benefits Convention, 1967
(No. 128) and Recommendation, 1967 (No. 131), Medical Care and Sickness Benefits Convention, 1969 (No. 130) and Recommendation,
1969 (No. 134), Maintenance of Social Security Rights Convention, 1982 (No. 157) and Recommendation, 1983 (No. 167), Employment
Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988 (No. 168) and Recommendation, 1988 (No. 176), Maternity
Protection Convention, 2000 (No. 183) and Recommendation, 2000 (No. 191), and Social Protection Floors Recommendation, 2012
(No. 202). These instruments are reproduced in the compendium Building social protection systems: International standards and human
rights instruments (Geneva, ILO, 2017).

211

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Recommendation, 2012 (No. 202). 2 Other Conventions and Recommendations set higher standards in
respect of the different social security branches, or spell
out the social security rights of migrant workers.
ILO standards establish qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks which together determine the minimum
standards of social security protection to be provided by
social security schemes when life risks or circumstances
occur, with regard to:
• definition of the contingency (what risk or life circumstance must be covered?)
• persons protected (who must be covered?)
• type and level of benefits (what should be provided?)
• entitlement conditions, including qualifying period
(what should a person do to get the right to a benefit?)
• duration of benefit and waiting period (how long
must the benefit be paid/provided for?)

In addition, they set out common rules of collective
organization, financing and management of social security, as well as principles for the good governance of
national systems. These include:
• the general responsibility of the State for the due
provision of benefits and proper administration of
social security systems;
• solidarity, collective financing and risk-pooling;
• participatory management of social security
schemes;
• guarantee of defined benefits;
• adjustment of pensions in payment to maintain the
purchasing power of beneficiaries; and
• the right to complain and appeal.
Tables AIII.1–AIII.9 provide a summary overview of
some of the key requirements set out in ILO standards.

Definitions
The scope of coverage is measured by the number of social security policy areas provided for by law. This
indicator can take the value 0 to 8 according to the total number of social security policy areas (or branches)
with a programme anchored in national legislation.
The following eight branches are taken into consideration: sickness, maternity, old age, survivors, invalidity,
child/family, employment injury and unemployment.
The number of branches covered by at least one programme provides an overview of the scope of legal social
security provision.

Table B.2 Overview of national social security systems

 At least one programme anchored in national legislation, including employer-liability programmes based
on mandatory risk pooling.
 Legislation not yet entered into force.
p Limited provision (e.g. labour code only).
r Only benefit in kind (e.g. medical benefit).

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Table B.3 Social protection effective coverage (SDG indicator 1.3.1), latest available year

1

The proportion of the population protected in at least one area (SDG indicator 1.3.1 (a): Proportion of the
total population receiving benefits at least under one of the contingencies (contributory or non-contributory
benefit) or actively contributing to at least one social security scheme.

2

Proportion of children covered by social protection benefits: Ratio of children/households receiving child
benefits to the total number of children/households with children.

3

Proportion of women giving birth covered by maternity benefits: Ratio of women receiving maternity
benefits to women giving birth in the same year (estimated based on age-specific fertility rates published
in the UN World Population Prospects or on the number of live births corrected by the share of twin and
triplet births).

4

Proportion of persons with disabilities receiving benefits: Ratio of persons receiving disability benefits to
persons with severe disabilities. The latter is calculated as the product of prevalence of disability ratios
(published for each country group by the World Health Organization) and each country’s population.

5

Proportion of unemployed receiving benefits: Ratio of recipients of unemployment benefits to the number
of unemployed persons.

6

Proportion of older persons receiving a pension: Ratio of persons above statutory retirement age receiving
an old-age pension (including contributory and non-contributory) to persons above statutory retirement age.

7

Proportion of vulnerable persons receiving benefits: ratio of social assistance recipients to the total number
of vulnerable persons. The latter are calculated by subtracting from the total population all people in
working age contributing to a social insurance scheme or receiving contributory benefits and all persons
above retirement age receiving contributory benefits.

8

OECD countries have survivors included under old-age pensions

9

China. Includes the number of people who have received Age Benefits for Urban and Rural Residents
and Old-Age Benefits for Urban Workers. Regarding the statutory pensionable age, blue-collar female
enterprise employees retire at 50 while white-collar female enterprise employees retire at 55. The 60 and
above age group was taken for women.

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Table B.6 Unemployment: Indicators of effective coverage. Unemployed who actually receive benefits, 2000 to latest available year (SDG indicator 1.3.1 for unemployed)

Swaziland. No programme anchored in legislation. Workers contributing to a provident fund may receive an
early pension at age 45 if covered employment ceases.

ILO (International Labour Office). World Social Protection Database, based on the Social Security Inquiry
(SSI). Available at: http://www.social-protection.org/gimi/gess/RessourceDownload.action?ressource.
ressourceId=54603 [June 2017].

7

Armenia. In 2015, unemployment benefits were discontinued and replaced by employment promotion
measures, including cash assistance to persons who are uncompetitive in the labour market.

8

India. Numerator: ILO Social Security Inquiry. “Unemployment allowance” was added in 2005 to the existing
Employees’ State Insurance Corporation scheme, which covers sickness and maternity, and covers 24% of
all formal sector workers, or 2% of the entire workforce. Does not include beneficiaries from the National
Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The target group for this programme is broader than the unemployed.
Withdrawal from the provident fund is possible at any age if covered employment ceases involuntarily.

9

Indonesia. The labour law (Law No.13/2003) mandates a severance payment in case of employment
termination (amount between 1 and 8 months of salary depending on the duration of employment).

10

Myanmar. Myanmar enacted its social security law in 2012. The law includes unemployment insurance
benefit (section 37), but the unemployment benefit has not yet been implemented.

11

Singapore. No programme anchored in legislation. The Workfare Training Support Scheme provides
subsidized employment training, including a training allowance of up to SGD 4.50 an hour of training
completed, to persons who qualify for the Workfare Income Support Scheme.

12

Andorra. There is no separate unemployment programme, but government assistance is available for
identified cases of need.

13

Netherlands. Numerator: StatLine: Number of benefits. Available at: http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/selection/

14

Colombia. Employed and self-employed persons may choose to allocate a portion of their contributions to a
mandatory individual severance account or to a supplemental individual account.

Dominican Republic. No programme anchored in legislation. Workers contributing to a mandatory
individual account may receive an “Unemployed workers’ old-age pension” if aged 57 to 59, unemployed,
and have at least 25 years of contributions (with less than 25 years, the insured can receive a pension
based on the accumulated funds or continue contributing to reach 25 years).

16

Mexico. In case of unemployment, withdrawals from the old-age mandatory individual account are
allowed for workers over age 60. The amount of the withdrawal depends on the number of years of
contributions to the account: with at least five years of contributions, the amount withdrawn may equal
90 days of the insured’s average earnings used to calculate the last 250 weeks of contributions, or 11%
of the individual account balance, whichever is lower; with three to five years of contributions and at
least 12 bimonthly contributions, the amount withdrawn may equal 30 days of the insured’s covered
earnings used to calculate contributions, up to ten times the legal monthly minimum wage. In addition,
there are programmes to support unemployed persons, such as the Programa de Apoyo al Empleo (PAE)
and the Programa de Empleo Temporal (PET). The PAE consists of a set of active labour market policies
implemented by the Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare (STPS), through the General Coordination of
Employment (CGE) which designs, coordinates, oversees and funds the programme, and operated by the
National Employment Service (SNE) in the states.

17

Paraguay. No programme anchored in legislation. Law No. 253 (1971) requires the National Service for
Employment Promotion (SNPP), under the Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social Security, to provide
job training and placement programmes.

18

United States. All states, and Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia have separate
laws creating their own programmes.

19

Fiji. No programme anchored in legislation. The National Provident Fund permits limited cash draw down
payments if the member has resigned, terminated, been laid off or made redundant from work, or if the
work contract was not renewed.

20

Kiribati. Workers contributing to a provident fund may withdraw from their account at any age if
unemployed for over six months.

21

Papua New Guinea. The Superannuation (General Provision) Act of 2000 permits limited cash drawdown
payments after three months of unemployment, or complete cash drawdown if unemployed for a year.

Severance payment: In the national law (e.g. labour code) and directly paid by employers but no
unemployment benefit programme anchored in national legislation.

b

Unemployed beneficiaries of general social assistance schemes are not included due to unavailability of
data. Including them would increase coverage rates but only in countries where such schemes exist on a
larger scale (high-income and some middle-income countries).

c

Unemployment aid (supplementary to contributory benefits): Non-contributory unemployment cash
assistance provided to persons who are ineligible for, or have exhausted their entitlement to, a general
social insurance unemployment benefit, including first-time jobseekers.

d

Employment-related: Benefits are tied to earnings or previous employment but are financed by the
government.

2

In the absence of social security benefit in case of unemployment, workers covered by the labour law
may be entitled to a severance payment, usually on the basis of a minimum length of service and/or the
reason for the termination of the employment relation, sometimes depending on professional categories,
size of enterprise or other criteria. A severance payment is a lump sum. Forty-eight countries without an
unemployment benefit programme anchored in legislation provide such labour protection (information
available in the ILO Employment Protection Legislation Database (EPLex) and in ISSA and SSA, Social
security programs throughout the world).

3

Ghana. No programme anchored in legislation. Workers contributing to a mandatory occupational account
may receive an early pension at age 55 if they are unemployed.

4

Nigeria. After a 4-month waiting period, members of provident funds can withdraw a lump sum of up to
25% of their account balance if they become unemployed before age 50.

5

Seychelles. Under the 1980 Unemployment Fund Act, the social security fund provides subsistence income
for unemployed persons. The Agency for Social Protection provides wages for registered unemployed young
persons who work on approved projects, including the unemployment relief scheme, the apprenticeship
scheme and the skill acquisition programme. Available data refers to the unemployment relief scheme.

remaining amount can also be withdrawn later under certain conditions.

tenure and professional categories. No decree had been adopted as of October 2012.

Dominican Republic. The disability pension is a percentage of the
insured’s previous earnings and is financed by disability insurance until
retirement or death, if earlier. The insurance company also pays a monthly
contribution to the insured person’s individual account until retirement or
death. The disability pension ceases at the normal pensionable age, when
the insured may access the individual account balance to purchase a
price-indexed annuity or make programmed withdrawals.

Botswana. Monthly cash benefits of BWP 90 and a monthly food basket
worth BWP 450 to 750 are provided to all destitute residents, including
those unable to support themselves because of old age, disability or a
chronic health condition.
Ghana. A lump sum of the present value of total contributions plus interest
is paid.

3

Nigeria. The pension is based on the insured’s account balance and the
expected life span. At retirement, the insured may choose between an
annuity or monthly or quarterly payments calculated on life expectancy.
The insured can withdraw a partial lump sum from the individual account
if the remaining balance is sufficient to purchase an annuity or to fund
periodic payments.

Zimbabwe. In addition, under the 1998 Social Welfare Assistance Act, the
Department of Social Welfare provides limited public assistance to needy
persons incapable of work and to persons aged 65 or older or assessed as
having a disability.
Bolivia, Plurinational State of. The monthly pension is based on the
insured’s previous earnings. The insurance company pays a monthly
contribution of 10% of the insured’s average earnings in the last five years
to the insured’s individual account until retirement or death. If an insured
person assessed as having a disability does not meet the contribution
requirements for a disability pension, the insured may use the individual
account balance plus accrued rights under the social insurance system
(if applicable) to purchase a temporary annuity based on the insured’s
previous earnings (with a legally defined minimum monthly annuity).

El Salvador. The monthly pension is a percentage of the insured’s previous
earnings. A guaranteed minimum disability benefit is paid if the individual
account balance is insufficient to finance the minimum pension set by law.
Mexico. Persons insured before 1 July 1997 may choose to receive
benefits under the mandatory individual account or the previous social
insurance system. The monthly pension for the individual account is a
percentage of the insured’s previous earnings. A guaranteed minimum
disability pension is paid if the individual account balance is insufficient to
finance the minimum pension set by law.
Panama. The insured’s account balance divided by an actuarial value
linked to life expectancy is paid in programmed withdrawals. If the
combined social insurance and individual account disability pension is less
than what the insured would have been entitled to under the old social
insurance system, collective insurance pays the difference.
Peru. When public- and private-sector employees enter the workforce, they
may choose between the individual account system (SPP) and the public
social insurance system (SNP). Insured persons who do not make a choice
become SPP members. SNP members may switch to the SPP but may not
switch back. The SPP pension is a percentage of the insured’s previous
earnings, and disability insurance pays the difference if the individual
account balance is insufficient to finance the permanent disability pension
the insured would have been entitled to receive.

15

Lebanon. The benefit is paid as a lump sum.

16

Hong Kong, China. The mandatory occupational pension is a provident
fund. Mandatory provident funds in Hong Kong are privately run

23

Papua New Guinea. The mandatory occupational (superannuation)

five years before the claim.

27

Netherlands. The non-contributory disability benefit is paid to persons who
were assessed as incapable of work because of a handicap or a disease
by age 18 (age 30 if a student for at least six months in the year before the
occurence of the disability).

28

San Marino. The benefit is paid as an annuity based on the individual
account balance.

29

Table B.8 Disability benefits: Key features

2

Colombia. The monthly benefit is a percentage of the insured’s previous
monthly earnings. A lump-sum settlement is paid if the insured does not
meet the contribution requirements for the individual account disability
pension. Low-income persons may receive a means-tested individual
account benefit (Beneficios Ecónomicos Periódicos – BEPS) if the
contributions are below a defined threshold.

8

Notes
…

Chile. The monthly pension is a percentage of the insured’s previous
earnings. The pension is financed through the individual account.
(Disability insurance tops up the accumulated capital in the individual
account if the balance is less than the required minimum to finance the
permanent disability pension.) A guaranteed minimum disability pension
or a disability social security top-up benefit (APS Invalidez) is paid if the
insured’s account balance is insufficient to finance the minimum pension.

2

In several countries under certain conditions, women can retire before their normal retirement age for time spent
raising children.

3

Kenya. Type of programme. The 2013 National Social Security Fund Act established a pension fund and a new
provident fund. Membership in the pension fund is mandatory for all employed persons aged 18 to 60. Members of
the old provident fund were automatically enrolled in the pension fund; their assets in the old provident fund remain
there. Membership in the new provident fund is voluntary. The rates mentioned here are for both programmes
combined (pension fund and voluntary provident fund).

4

Malawi. In March 2011, a pension law established a mandatory old-age pension system based on individual
accounts for private-sector workers earning above a minimum salary threshold. The law has yet to be implemented.

5

Seychelles. The old-age grant (from social insurance) is paid if the insured does not meet the contribution
requirements for an old-age pension.

6

Sierra Leone. 2.5% of monthly income; 10% for civil servants and teachers; 12% for military and police personnel.

7

Argentina. From 1994 until the end of 2008, there was a mixed system where all insured workers were in the firstpillar public pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system; for the second pillar, workers chose between contributing to an individual
account and to the PAYG defined benefit system. A 2008 law closed the second-pillar individual accounts and
transferred all workers and their account balances to the new one-pillar PAYG system.

8

Bolivia, Plurinational State of. In 1997, all active members of the social insurance system transferred to a system of
privately managed mandatory individual accounts. In 2008, a new universal pension (Renta Dignidad) replaced the
Bonosol (available to all resident citizens of Bolivia older than age 65 from 1996 to 2008).

9

Colombia. An old-age family pension is paid to couples of pensionable age that do not meet contribution requirements
and are classified as SISBEN I or II (poor households). Social assistance: financed by 1-2% of covered payroll of
contributory scheme.

10

Dominican Republic. The pay-as-you-go (PAYG) social insurance system for private-sector workers was closed to
new entrants in 2003 and is being phased out. It covers private-sector workers aged 45 or older in 2003 who chose
to remain in the social insurance system and private-sector pensioners who began receiving their pensions before
June 2003. Public-sector workers who opted not to join the individual account system remain in the separate social
insurance system for public-sector workers. Subsidized individual accounts for self-employed persons and other
vulnerable groups have not yet been implemented.

11

Ecuador. The provision under the 2001 law to create a system of individual accounts to complement the social
insurance old-age pension programme was not implemented.

12

El Salvador. Insured persons who were older than age 55 (men) or age 50 (women) in 1998, and workers older
than age 36 in 1998 who did not opt for the individual account system are covered under the old social insurance
system. The Government subsidizes the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system and finances an indexed bond for account
holders who made contributions to the old social insurance system. The bond is the insured’s contributions to the
old social insurance system plus interest.

13

Honduras. Mandatory individual accounts for persons with earnings above HNL 8,882.30 per month have not yet
been implemented. Persons with earnings up to HNL 8,882.30 per month may make voluntary contributions to
individual accounts.

14

Mexico. The Government contributes 0.225% of covered earnings plus an average flat-rate amount of MXN 4.21 (2013)
to the individual account for each day contributed by an insured with earnings up to 15 times the legal monthly minimum
wage; for disability and survivors’ benefits, 0.125% of covered earnings; finances the guaranteed minimum pension.

15

Nicaragua. There are special systems for war victims, miners, needy elderly and needy disabled (non-contributory).

16

Peru. When public- and private-sector employees enter the workforce, they may choose between the individual account
system (SPP) and the public social insurance system (SNP). Insured persons who do not make a choice become
SPP members. SNP members may switch to the SPP but may not switch back, except under certain circumstances.

17

Uruguay. The mixed social insurance and individual account system is mandatory for employed and self-employed
persons born after 1 April 1956, with monthly earnings greater than UYU 39,871 and voluntary for those with
monthly earnings of UYU 39,871 or less. All others are covered only by the social insurance system.

18

Canada. A post-retirement benefit is paid to people of pensionable age who continue working. Contributions to the
pension plan are mandatory at any age under the Quebec Pension Plan; contributions are also mandatory under the
Canada Pension Plan for persons aged 60 to 64 and voluntary if between 65 and 70 (employer contributions are
mandatory for this last age group).

19

Kuwait. The basic, supplementary and remuneration systems are all part of the social insurance system. Eligible
for the supplementary pension are employees who meet the requirement for the basic system pension, and whose
monthly earnings are above KWD 1,500 (note that the self-employed are excluded for the supplementary pension
only). Employees with monthly earnings above KWD 2,750 pay an additional 2.5% per month to finance benefit
adjustments under the basic system (3.5% for self-employed persons with monthly earnings up to KWD 1,500;
1% for employers for employees with monthly earnings up to KWD 2,750). The pension from the remuneration
system is for employees who receive either pension but not both, and who do not meet the contribution
requirements. Contributions to the remuneration system cease after 18 years for all contributors (employees, selfemployed persons and the government officials).

20

Kuwait. Basic system: Government: 10% of covered earnings (public employees), 32.5% of payroll (military
personnel), and 25% of monthly income minus the self-employed person’s contributions (self-employed persons).

21

China. The basic pension insurance scheme has two components: a social insurance programme and mandatory
individual accounts. The pension schemes for rural and non-salaried urban residents have two components: a noncontributory pension and individual accounts.

22

China. Since July 2011, existing regional and local social security schemes, including pooling arrangements, are
gradually being unified under the country’s first national law on social insurance.

23

Japan. The social insurance system consists of a flat-rate benefit under the national pension programme (NP)
and an earnings-related benefit under the employees’ pension insurance programme (EPI).

24

Mongolia. The new legislation adopted in 2017 provides that the retirement age shall be increased by six months
every year until reaching a retirement age of 65 for men by 2026, and 65 for women by 2036 (starting from 2018).
The same applies to eligible age for a social welfare pension in old age.

25

Mongolia. The new legislation adopted in 2017 increased pension contribution rates for both employers and workers by
2.5 points (1% in 2018, 0.5% in 2019 and 1% in 2020) bringing the total mandatory contribution to 19%. The same
applies to the voluntary pension insurance contribution (1% in 2018, 0.5% in 2019 and 1% in 2020) rising to 12.5%.

26

Cambodia. Only public servants receive a pension. The legal retirement age is 60 for category A, 58 for category B
and 55 for categories C and D. Civil servants receive a monthly pension equal to 80% of their net basic salary when
they have accomplished at least 30 years of service; and 60% of their net basic salary when they have at least 20
years but under 30 years of service by the age of retirement. Those who have completed more than 20 years of
service receive a proportional annual supplementary pension of 2% of their net salary. The total amount does not
exceed 80% of the seniority pension and is not lower than basic monthly salary. Civil servants who have reached
the retirement age and have less than 20 years of service will have no pension and receive only a lump sum
allowance, equally to eight total monthly salaries. The scheme is fully funded from the national budget. A pension
scheme for workers in the private sector is yet to be implemented.

27

Indonesia. The defined benefit (DB) pension scheme (social insurance for private-sector workers) entered into effect
on 1 July 2015, with the enactments of the Law on National Social Security System (Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional
or SJSN) (No. 40/2004); then the Law on Social Security Implementing Agency (Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan
Sosial or BPJS) (No. 24/2011) and government regulation on pension programme (No.45/2015).

28

Indonesia. Coverage rates are calculated with proxy data for number of workers, not exact value.

29

Malaysia. The social insurance scheme is only for civil servants.

30

Thailand. A new voluntary social security system for informal economy workers was initiated in 2011. The scheme
is based on contributions from workers and the Government to finance old-age, disability, survivors’, sickness and
maternity benefits.

31

Thailand. The Government’s contribution to the pension for informal economy workers depends on the insured
person’s age: 50% of the insured’s contributions if younger than age 30; 80% if aged 30 to 49; and 100% if aged
50 or older.

As defined in United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 1244 of 1999.

b

For the countries where the national minimum wage varies according to region and/or sector of economy, an
interval was considered.

Year introduced: The first scheme that is the legal predecessor of any current scheme is indicated. Most schemes have
been reformed since and the current legislation is rarely that of the founding year.
Legal requirements: Categories of criteria applicants have to fulfil, e.g. holding citizenship of the country in question,
having a legal residence, having income below a set level or passing an income test, having assets below a set level,
not receiving any other pension or receiving only a low pension.

Malawi. There is no national social insurance scheme in Malawi. The
Government Public Pension Scheme is a non-contributory, defined
benefit, PAYG system. There are around 600 private pension funds in
Malawi not included here.

5

Lebanon. There is currently no income security for the elderly through
regular old-age pension benefits, only a lump sum.

6

China. The indicator for China includes contributors to the new rural
social pension plan introduced nationwide in 2009. This new pension
has two components: a basic pension component financed by local
and central government and a personal account component based on
contributions from enrolled individuals. In relatively poor regions the
central Government pays approximately 80% of the cost of the basic
pension component and the local government bears the rest. The first
basic pension component justifies inclusion in this indicator, focusing on
periodic cash benefits for the elderly to ensure basic income security.

7

Bangladesh. The Government provides its own employees with a noncontributory, defined benefit pension with survivors’ benefits, funded
through tax revenues. Civil servants are eligible to receive a pension at
the age of 57.

8

Iran, Islamic Republic of. Corresponds to total number of insured as
principal contributors and refers to the social security organization and
state retirement fund.

9

Tonga. In September 2010, the National Retirement Benefits Scheme
(NRBS) Bill 2010 was passed by the Legislative Assembly, providing
a similar mandatory superannuation plan for the private sector and
other organizations. No statistics available yet (see: http://www.nrbf.to/
[May 2017]).

10

Vanuatu. Active member refers to a person who has at least one
contribution paid on that member’s behalf for the current or any of the
preceding three months (see: http://www.vnpf.com.vu/p/vnpf-index.html
[May 2017]).

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Notes
a

Differences from proportions indicated in table B.10 may result from:
differences in reference years; differences in population of reference
between the non-contributory pension and the statutory pensionable
age, considered here as the main criterion to define the population of
reference applied to all pensions.

15

United States. Retirement (includes OASI), all beneficiaries aged 65 and
over. Includes beneficiaries in foreign countries.

16

Lebanon. There is currently no income security for the elderly through
regular old-age pension benefits, only a lump sum.

17

China. Includes the number of people who have received Age Benefits
for Urban and Rural Residents and Old-Age Benefits for Urban Workers.
Regarding the statutory pensionable age, blue-collar female enterprise
employees retire at 50 while white-collar female enterprise employees
retire at 55. The 60 and above age group was taken for women.

18

Malaysia. Includes government pension scheme, which is the only one
providing cash periodic benefits, and a social assistance programme
targeting poor elderly with no family support.

19

Philippines. The old-age grant, launched in 2011, and the retirement
programme for veterans, are considered non-contributory schemes.

20

Thailand. These proportions refer only to beneficiaries of the old-age
or disability social pensions. As a result, the reference taken is not the
statutory pensionable age of 55 but the age of eligibility for the old-age
social pension (60 and over).

21

Iran, Islamic Republic of. Refers to the social security organization and
state retirement fund.

22

Sri Lanka. This indicator refers to contributory mandatory schemes
providing pensions for people above statutory retirement age (i.e. it
excludes PSPS, which is a non-contributory scheme; EPF and ETF,
providing lump sums; and the three voluntary social security schemes,
Farmers’ Pension and Social Security Benefit Scheme, Fishermen’s
Pension and Social Security Benefit Scheme, and Social Pension and
Social Security Benefit Scheme (initially for self-employed only), which
are voluntary and provide either lump-sum or periodic benefits.

23

Samoa. The Samoa National Provident Fund (SNPF) provides the
option for a retirement pension or full withdrawal. Since the majority
of SNPF members take the option of full withdrawal, there were only
445 pensioners and 276 beneficiaries (i.e. 3.7% of persons age 55 and
over) in 2011.

24

Tonga. Only a minority of members opt for a regular pension once
reaching pensionable age. In September 2010, the National Retirement
Benefits Scheme (NRBS) Bill 2010 was passed by the Legislative
Assembly, providing a similar mandatory superannuation plan for the
private sector and other organizations. No statistics are available yet.

25

Vanuatu. Mainly withdrawals.

26

Albania. Includes old-age pensions including war veteran, special merit
and supplementary pensions. Ratio above statutory retirement age.

27

Azerbaijan. For the calculation of the coverage, the lower eligible age
(statutory pensionable age) of 60 is taken for consistency reasons.

Additional notes by country
1

366

Algeria. Including old-age reversion pension but excluding anticipated
pension. Non-contributory pension (data for 2009): Evolution de la
catégorie des personnes âgées bénéficiaires de l'AFS (2004–09).
Reference population: Eligible age 60 years.

2

Angola. Total number of pensioners. There is no general social
assistance programme aimed at the elderly.

3

Burundi. Includes old-age, survivors’ and ascendant pensions for people
aged 60 and over.

4

Cabo Verde. Regarding the contributory pension provided by CNPS, the
statutory retirement age is 65 for men and 60 for women. However, as
the age of eligibility for the non-contributory pension is 60 for both men
and women, the reference population for the denominator has been
set at 60. Survey data (provided in this Statistical Annex) provide lower
numbers than administrative sources.

5

Congo. Includes disability and survivors' pensioners above statutory
pensionable age of 60.

6

Côte d'Ivoire. Data from the Caisse Nationale de Prévoyance Sociale
(CNPS) and Caisse Générale de Retraite des Agents de l’Etat (CGRAE).

7

Gabon. The number refers to all pensions, resulting in a possible
overestimation of old-age pensioners.

8

Brazil. Age range used for the indicators: 65 and over for both men and
women despite a statutory retirement age of 60 for women.

9

Colombia. Age range used for the indicator: 60 and over.

10

Costa Rica. The normal retirement age is 65 years with at least
300 months of contributions, although it can be reduced with additional
months of contributions. Age 65 is used as a basis to define the
reference population for this indicator.

11

Dominican Republic. Age range used for the indicator: 60 and over.

12

Nicaragua. The normal retirement age of 60 years is used as a basis to
define the reference population for this indicator.

13

Panama. The normal retirement age of 62 (men) or 57 (women) are used
as a basis to define the reference population for this indicator.

14

Uruguay. Proportion calculated for persons aged 60 and over. For those
aged 65 and over, this proportion by sex reaches 85.9%.

World Social Protection Report 2017–19: Universal social protection to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals

Table B.13 Deficits in universal health protection by rural/urban areas (global, regional and country estimates)

11

Coverage gap due to financial resource deficit is based on median value in low vulnerability group of countries.
The ILO financial deficit indicator follows the same principle as the access deficit indicator regarding total health
spending (in US$ per capita and per year) except out-of-pocket payments. The relative median value in 2011 in
group of countries assessed as ‘low vulnerable’ is estimated at 239 US$ per capita and per year.

12

Aggregate measures are weighted by total population. Refer to data source 3.

…: Not available.
* The ‘year’ column shows the year in which the proxy data were collected.
For national estimates:
Estimate in percentage of population without legal health coverage. Coverage includes affiliated members of health
insurance or estimation of the population having free access to health care services provided by the State.

10

The ILO staff access deficit indicator reflects the supply side of access availability – in this case the availability of
human resources at a level that guarantees at least basic, but universal, effective access to everybody. To estimate
access to the services of skilled medical professionals (physicians and nursing and midwifery personnel), it uses as
a proxy the relative difference between the density of health professionals in a given country and its median value
in countries with a low level of vulnerability (population access to services of medical professionals in countries
with low vulnerability is thus used as a threshold for other countries). The relative ILO threshold corresponds to the
median value in the group of countries assessed as ‘low vulnerable’ (regarding the structure of employment and
poverty). Based on 2011 data from WHO (number of physicians, nursing and midwifery personnel per 10,000), the
estimated median value is 41.1 per 10,000 population when weighted by total population. Another way to look at it
is to refer to population not covered due to a deficit from the supply side (see second part of example below). Then,
the ILO staff access deficit indicator estimates the dimension of the overall performance of health-care delivery as
a percentage of the population that has no access to health care if needed. This value is above the minimum set
by WHO for primary care delivery, which is 23 per 10,000. Professional staff includes physicians and nursing and
midwifery personnel as defined by WHO. See Indicator definitions and metadata for indicator HRH_01: Number
of nursing personnel; HRH_02: Number of physicians; and HRH_03: Number of midwifery personnel available at:
http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.imr [27 February 2015].

For rural/urban estimates:
13

The percentage of GDP provided by the agricultural sector was used as a proxy for the legal coverage rights of
the rural population and the percentage of GDP provided by other sectors as a proxy for the rights of the urban
population. Available at: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.AGR.TOTL.ZS [27 February 2015].

14

National, rural, and urban skilled birth attendance (SBA) rates were used as proxies for health workers distribution,
financial resource allocation, and maternal mortality ratio. Rural (/urban) staff access deficit (SAD) and Rural (/
urban) financial deficit (FD) are assumed to be directly related to the urban to national SBA ratio, while rural (/
urban) maternal mortality (MMR) is assumed to be inversely related to urban to national SBA ratio. Data from
the most recent survey listed on the GHO website was used. Available at: http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.
main.1630?lang=en and http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.94130 [27 February 2015].

15

Household consumption on health ($PPP) in rural and urban areas are extracted from the World Bank Global
Consumption database. The ratio between rural (/ urban) to national household consumption on health are used
as proxy for rural and urban out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure. Available at: http://datatopics.worldbank.org/
consumption/sector/Health [27 February 2015].

FTE) per 100 persons 65 years and over” to “Formal long-term care workers (head count, HC) per
100 persons 65 years and over” (i.e. FTE:HC) from 2013 or latest year available. The median FTE:HC
ratio is 0.69 in the representative group of countries. Using the high correlation between FTE and HC (at
correlation coefficient of 0.81), the median FTE:HC ratio enables the best prediction for FTE where country
data are not available.

Approximation based on the median ratio of “Formal long-term care workers (full-time equivalent, FTE) per
100 persons 65 years and over” to “Informal long-term care workers per 100 persons 65 years and over”
(i.e. FTE:INF) from 2013 or latest year available. The median FTE:INF ratio is 0.12 deriving from countries
mentioned in note 2. As most of these countries have means-tested long-term care systems, the median
FTE:INF ratio enables the second best prediction for FTE (with tendency for over estimation) where country
data are not available.

A group of countries representing a broad range of legal, financing and organizational approaches towards
LTC is used to generate the population weighted median threshold of 4.2 long term care workers (full time
equivalent, FTE) per 100 persons 65 years and over in 2013 (or latest available year). The country group
consists amongst others of Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel,
Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, United States.

2

In 21 countries data on numbers of informal LTC workers are available as head count only. Thus,
figures indicated include both part time and full time workers. Countries with data availability include
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom,
United States.

Coverage gap due to staff access deficit based on the median value in the selected group of countries.
The relative median value amounts to 4.2 formal long-term care workers (full-time equivalent, FTE) per
100 persons 65 years and over in 2013. The indicator shows the percentage of the population 65 years
and over that is excluded from access to long-term care services due to insufficient numbers of formal
long term care workers. It is calculated as follows:
Staff Access Deficit =

The amount of out-of-pocket expenditure on LTC among the population 65 years and over is the weighted
average of the out-of-pocket expenses on home care (hc129e) and institutional care (hc085e) in the last
12 months.

9

Due to differences in standard of living across sample European countries, out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses
are expressed as a percentage of household (HH) income per year. It is a weighted average of out-ofpocket expenditure spent on home care and institutional care, calculated as follows:

Total population and the percentage of population 65 years and over are extracted from the World Bank:
World Development Indicators, 2013. GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2011 international $) and GDP, PPP

OECD countries are used to generate the population weighted median threshold of 1,461.8 PPP$ per
person 65 years and over in 2013.

Coverage gap due to financial resources deficit calculated on the population weighted median value of all
OECD countries. The relative population weighted median value is based on the average long term care
expenditure between 2006 and 2010. It amounts to 1,461.8 PPP$ per person 65 years and over per year.
The indicator shows the percentage of the population 65 years and over that is excluded from access to
LTC services due to a lack of financial resources. It is calculated as follows:

The percentage of the population experiencing out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure for LTC is based on a
population from 15 European countries amounting to 92689 persons, 33,794 of whom are between the
ages of 50 and 64 and 42,441 of whom are 65 years and over. Based on the “health care utilization
and out-of-pocket expenses” module of the SHARE survey, it captures the percentage of the population
experiencing out-of-pocket expenditure for long-term care on home care (hc128_) and institutional care
(ho062_) in the last 12 months. It is calculated as follows:

Workers in non-health occupations are paid formal and informal health
economy workers who are engaged in public and private (including selfemployed) work within the health sector (C) as well as outside the health
sector (D). Through the delivery of goods and services they support the
work of workers in health occupations. These workers are among the
ISIC Revision 4 categories G to P and R to U:
–– wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and
motorcycles (G);
–– transportation and storage (H);
–– accommodation and food service activities (I);
–– information and communication (J);
–– financial and insurance activities (K);
–– real estate activities (L);
–– professional, scientific and technical activities (M);
–– administrative and support service activities (N);
–– public administration and defence; compulsory social security (O);
–– education (P);
–– arts, entertainment and recreation (R);
–– other service activities (S);
–– activities of households as employers; undifferentiated goodsand
services-producing activities of households for own use (T); and
–– activities of extraterritorial organizations and bodies (U).

4

To estimate the number of health economy workers in non-health
occupations (C+D) for counties in the ILOSTAT database, the most
recent numbers from ISIC Revision 4 category Q (Human Health and
Social Work Activities) were assumed to represent health economy
workers employed in the health sector (A+C).
To estimate the number of health economy workers outside the health
sector (B+D), i.e. the ISIC Revision 4 categories G to P and R to U, the
total health expenditure (THE) as percentage of the gross domestic
product (GDP) was used as proxy variable. Thus, the percentage of
service workers outside the health sector who provide health services
was assumed to be the same as the percentage of the GDP that is spent
on health. In a final step, the number of health economy workers in
health occupations (A+B) was subtracted from the number of all health
economy workers (A+B+C+D) to generate the numbers of workers in
non-health occupations only (C+D).

5

Unpaid informal care workers who gave up on work due to the
unavailability of affordable long-term care services are persons who
may be family members, friends or neighbours and who provide unpaid
services informally to persons who are in need of long-term care (E).

6

In a first step, to estimate the number of unpaid informal care workers,
whose work needs to be converted into formal labour, the numbers of
unpaid informal care workers in 21 countries that were published in a
recent ILO paper based on OECD data were taken (Scheil-Adlung, 2015).
For these 21 countries, the median ratio of unpaid informal workers to
the population 65+ was calculated and applied to all 185 countries.
In a second step and based on a 2015 UK survey of family members
providing care, the proportion of unpaid work that should be converted
into formal jobs was estimated. The survey found that 51 percent of
carers had given up work in order to provide long-term care for a family
or household member, 12 percent had taken early retirement and 21
percent had reduced their working hours. Of those who gave up work,
retired early or took reduced working hours, 30 percent said it was
because there were no suitable care services and 22 percent because
they could not afford to pay for the available services. This indicates that
44 percent of all unpaid informal workers should be counted as part of
the health economy workforce because the work that they do should be
transformed into formal jobs ((51+12+21)*(0.3 + 0.22) = 44)). Thus, the
numbers generated in the first step were multiplied by 0.4 taking into
account that not all unpaid work should be transformed into formal jobs.

7

Based on a group of low-vulnerability countries, i.e. countries with
low poverty levels and small informal economies, median values were
calculated for workers in health and non-health occupations. This
yielded thresholds for all health economy workers. These were applied to
the 2015 population in each of the 185 countries to estimate the number
of each type of worker currently missing. By subtracting the number
currently in the workforce with the number needed, the shortage
of workers was estimated. If this resulted in a negative number, the
shortage was set as zero.

8

The numbers from the current gaps of workers in health and non-health
occupations were applied to the UN Population Division’s medium
variant population projections for 2030 to estimate the related level of
missing workers in 2030.

Workers in health occupations (A+B) are defined as paid formal and
informal health economy workers who are
A. Employed in the public and private sector (including self-employed)
within the health sector and
B. Outside the health sector in other economic sectors contributing to
the health sector.
These workers have received higher or vocational education in a
health field as outlined in the International Standard Classification
of Occupations (ISCO-08) groups 22 (health professionals) and
32 (health associate professionals). These groups include the ISCO88 unit groups 222 (health professionals other than nursing including
medical doctors; dentists; veterinarians; pharmacists; and health
professionals not elsewhere classified), 223 (nursing and midwifery
professionals), 322 (health associate professionals other than nursing
including medical assistants; hygienists, health and environmental
officers; dieticians and nutritionists; optometrists and opticians; dental
assistants; physiotherapists and related associate professionals;
veterinary assistants; pharmaceutical assistants; health associate
professionals not elsewhere classified), 323 (nursing and midwifery
associate professionals) and 324 (traditional medicine practitioners and
faith healers).

2

To estimate the number of health economy workers in health
occupations (A+B) for ILOSTAT countries, the most recent numbers
of workers in ISCO groups 22 (health professionals) and 32 (health
associate professionals) were extracted from the ILOSTAT database and
resulted in data for 52 countries. For the 133 countries not included
in ILOSTAT, data from the WHO Global Health Observatory was used,
matched to the ISCO groups and adjusted as it did not include privatesector workers. For the United States, data was obtained from the US
Department of Health and Human Services and matched to the ISCO
groups. Since ILOSTAT does not disaggregate ISCO codes to the threedigit level, it was not possible to identify numbers for personal care
workers (ISCO code 532). Because personal care workers are workers
in health occupations, OECD health statistics data were used to estimate
their numbers. The data from the 17 OECD countries from 2012, 2013
or 2014 revealed that 10% of the total employment in health and social
care are personal care workers. Ten per cent of the number of workers
in the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision 4
category Q (human health and social work activities) was thus added
to the numbers extracted from ILOSTAT and the WHO Global Health
Observatory databases.
