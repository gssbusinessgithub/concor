FOREWORD

Foreword

T

his is the ninth edition of Society at a Glance, the OECD’s biennial overview of social indicators.
As with its predecessors, this report addresses the growing demand for quantitative evidence on
social well-being and its trends across OECD countries. It updates some indicators included in the
previous eight editions and introduces several new ones. Data on Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,
Costa Rica, China, India, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia and South Africa are
included separately where available.
This edition of Society at a Glance puts the spotlight on lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and
transgender (LGBT) individuals, as they still suffer from various forms of discrimination. Indeed,
there is still a long way to go before LGBT people meet full-fledged acceptance in OECD countries.
Only half of OECD countries have legalised same-sex marriage throughout their national territory,
and less than a third allow for a change of gender on official documents to match gender identity
without forcing the transgender person to undergo sterilisation, sex-reassignment surgery, hormonal
therapy or a psychiatric diagnosis. Steps backward have also been witnessed. Yet, discrimination is
not only ethically unacceptable, it also entails substantial economic and social costs. The inclusion of
sexual and gender minorities should therefore become a top policy priority for OECD governments.
Chapter 1 provides a comprehensive overview of data and evidence on the size of sexual and
gender minorities and their socio-economic situation. It also highlights best practices to create
more inclusive environments for LGBT people. The rest of the report compares a wide range of
social outcomes across countries. Chapter 2 provides a guide to help readers understand the
structure of OECD social indicators. Chapter 3 presents new indicators on people’s perceptions of
social risks and government effectiveness, while Chapters 4 to 8 then consider these indicators in
more detail. Additional information on indicators can be found on the OECD web pages (http://

Executive summary

T

here is still a long way to go before lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender (LGBT)
individuals meet full-fledged acceptance in OECD countries. Overall, LGBT people still
suffer from various forms of discrimination. Yet, discrimination is not only ethically
unacceptable, it also entails substantial economic and social costs. The inclusion of sexual
and gender minorities should therefore become a top policy priority for OECD governments.
The first chapter of this report provides a comprehensive overview of data and
evidence on the size of sexual and gender minorities and the socio-economic situation of
LGBT people in OECD countries. It confirms that anti-LGBT discrimination hampers the
economic prospects and mental health of millions, and highlights best practices to create
more inclusive environments for sexual and gender minorities.

LGBT people stand for a sizeable minority
No census has ever included questions on sexual orientation and/or gender identity to
identify LGBT people, and only a few nationally representative surveys contain such
questions. In the 14 OECD countries where estimates are available, LGB people account for
2.7% of the adult population. In other words, in these 14 OECD countries, at least 17 million
adults self-identify as LGBT – 17 million adults is a lower bound since transgender people
are not counted due to data gaps –, which is as large as the total population of Chile or the
Netherlands.

The share of individuals who self-identify as LGBT is increasing
Disclosure of LGBT status in nationally representative surveys is consistently on the
rise from one survey round to the next. This trend is likely to continue in the future since
disclosure is more frequent among younger cohorts. In the United States, for instance, only
1.4% of people born before 1945 consider themselves as LGBT, against 8.2% among millennials
(born between 1980 and 1999).

Despite a shift toward greater acceptance of sexual and gender minorities,
discomfort with homosexual and transgender people is pervasive
Attitudes toward LGBT people are improving worldwide and have consistently been
more positive in OECD countries than elsewhere. However, there remains substantial room
for progress. OECD countries are only halfway to full social acceptance of homosexuality,
scoring five on a 1-to-10 acceptance scale. Moreover, only a minority of respondents in
OECD countries would accept that a child dresses and expresses herself/himself as a child
of the other gender. Discomfort with transgender people is slightly higher than discomfort
with LGB people.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

LGBT people report widespread discrimination
On average, more than one-out-of-three LGBT respondents in OECD countries report
having personally felt discriminated against because of their sexual orientation and/or
gender identity. Consistent with attitudes toward LGB people being more positive than
attitudes toward transgender people, the perception of discrimination is higher among
transgender than among homosexual and bisexual individuals.

Survey data reveal a significant LGBT penalty in the labour market
Nearly 50 research papers have compared the labour market outcomes of LGBT and
non-LGBT adults across OECD countries, based on representative survey data. These studies
reveal that LGBT people are penalised with respect to employment status and labour
earnings: they are 7% less likely to be employed than non-LGBT people and their labour
earnings are 4% lower. These estimates presumably constitute a lower bound of the actual
penalty faced by sexual and gender minorities since LGBT people who accept to disclose
their sexual orientation and gender identity in surveys tend to be economically advantaged.

Experimental data confirm that LGBT people are discriminated against
Labour market discrimination against LGBT applicants is measured by comparing the
rate at which two fictitious candidates are invited to a job interview: one that employers
perceive as LGBT and one that employers perceive as non-LGBT. The results reveal that
homosexual applicants are 1.5 times less likely to be invited to a job interview than their
heterosexual counterparts when their sexual orientation is conveyed through their
volunteer engagement or work experience in a gay and lesbian organisation. Experimental
data also reveal significant discrimination against transgender job applicants, as well as
against LGBT individuals outside the labour market.

LGBT people are at greater risk of mental health disorders
Representative survey data point to widespread psychological distress among LGBT
individuals. Lower mental health among sexual and gender minorities at least partly flows
from stigma. By living in a social environment that largely views heterosexuality and
congruence between sex at birth and gender identity as the only way of being normal,
LGBT people experience stress not undergone by heterosexual and cisgender individuals.

Making LGBT individuals and the penalties they face visible in national
statistics is a prerequisite to their inclusion
Collecting information on sexual orientation and gender identity in censuses as well
as national labour force, health and victimisation surveys is critical to improve awareness
on the penalty that LGBT individuals face. Although they are a minority, OECD countries
that include questions on sexual orientation and gender identity in their nationally
representative surveys constitute helpful precedents in order to disseminate good
practices on how to best collect such sensitive information.

Legally prohibiting anti-LGBT discrimination and ensuring equal rights
to LGBT individuals is essential to improve their situation
Enforcement of anti-discrimination and equality laws improves LGBT inclusion not
only by discouraging potential offenders, but also by shaping the social norm. Individuals

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

perceive legal changes as reflecting evolutions in what is socially acceptable and are willing
to conform to these shifts. For instance, acceptance of homosexuality has increased much
faster in countries after they adopted same-sex relationship recognition policies,
suggesting that legal changes do cause changes in attitudes.

Educating people in countering their unconscious biases is a key component
of any policy package aiming to improve LGBT inclusion
Unconscious bias training consists in making individuals aware of their unconscious
prejudices and stereotypes and teaching them how to overcome them. Evidence on the
impact of de-biasing interventions is scarce but shows that these interventions can be
highly effective, even when they are short. In the United States, a brief door-to-door
intervention has made citizens much more open and benevolent to transgender people,
with effects still visible three months after the intervention.

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

Introduction
There is still a long way to go before lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender
individuals – commonly referred to as “LGBT people” (Box 1.1) – meet full-fledged legal
acceptance. Same-sex sexual acts have become legal in all OECD countries where they were
formerly criminalised, as have hormonal therapy or gender-reassignment surgery.
Nevertheless, only half of OECD countries have legalised same-sex marriage throughout
their national territory, and less than a third allow for a change of gender on official
documents to match gender identity without forcing the transgender person to undergo
sterilisation, sex-reassignment surgery, hormonal therapy or a psychiatric diagnosis. Steps
backward have also been witnessed. Some OECD countries have introduced a constitutional
ban on same-sex marriage, and the very possibility of a person being legally recognised as
transgender is questioned in some others.1 Overall, LGBT people are still stigmatised and
exposed to various forms of discrimination, despite the fact that some LGBT individuals
managed to make it to the top.
Discrimination is not only ethically unacceptable, it also entails substantial economic
and social costs. Anti-LGBT discrimination hinders economic development through a wide
range of channels. It causes lower investment in human capital due to LGBT-phobic bullying
at school and poor returns, it reduces economic output by excluding LGBT talents from the
labour market, it undermines productivity by impairing LGBT people’s mental health, it
erodes public finances through significant spending on social and health services to address
the consequences of LGBT people’s marginalisation, etc. Anti-LGBT discrimination is also
detrimental to social cohesion through the persistence of restrictive gender norms that
impede gender equality more broadly speaking and, hence, the expansion of social and
economic roles, especially for women (Valfort, 2017[1]). The inclusion of sexual and gender
minorities should therefore become a top policy priority for OECD governments.
This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of data and evidence on the number
of LGBT people and their socio-economic situation in OECD countries. It confirms that antiLGBT discrimination hampers the economic prospects and mental health of millions and
highlights best-practices to create more inclusive environments for sexual and gender
minorities.
This chapter addresses the following three main questions:

14

●

How many people are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender? The first section of this
chapter presents a stocktaking of statistical sources to identify LGBT people in OECD
countries. It reveals that the share of individuals who self-identify as LGBT is sizeable,
and on the rise.

●

How do LGBT people fare? The second section explores the extent to which LGBT
individuals are penalised. After underlining that acceptance of LGBT people in OECD
countries remains limited, this section provides a wide range of evidence that anti-LGBT
discrimination is a reality. It also demonstrates that LGBT people show worse mental
health outcomes across the board, at least partly due to stigma.

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

What policies can improve LGBT inclusion? The final section examines what governments
can do to ensure greater inclusion of sexual and gender minorities. It identifies a range
of key policies, from making LGBT individuals and the penalties they face visible in
national statistics, to enacting and enforcing anti-discrimination and equality laws and
policies. Educating people in countering their unconscious biases also constitutes a
critical component of any policy package aiming to combat anti-LGBT discrimination.

Box 1.1. Who are LGBT people?
LGBT is the acronym for “lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender”. LGBT people are
defined with respect to two distinct characteristics: sexual orientation and gender identity.
Sexual orientation refers to a person’s capacity for profound emotional and sexual
attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with opposite-sex individuals, same-sex
individuals, or both opposite- and same-sex individuals. Sexual orientation allows for
differentiating between heterosexuals, lesbians, gay men and bisexuals. Gender identity
refers to a person’s internal sense of being masculine, feminine, or androgynous. As such,
it permits distinguishing between transgender and cisgender individuals, a transgender
(resp. cisgender) person being one whose gender identity differs from (resp. matches) her/his
biological sex at birth. Because they differ to the majority in terms of sexual orientation
and gender identity, LGBT people are also referred to as “sexual and gender minorities”.
The focus on LGBT individuals allows for addressing some of the issues intersex people
face. Intersex people are born with physical, hormonal or genetic features that are neither
wholly female nor wholly male. Due to this non-binary pattern, LGBT individuals are
overrepresented among intersex people, which explains that the letter “I” is often added to
the LGBT acronym to include intersex people. Among a non-representative sample of
272 intersex individuals in Australia, 52% self-identified as lesbians, gay men or bisexuals
and 8% self-identified as being transgender (Jones et al., 2016[2]).
Due to the absence of questions on individuals’ intersex status in nationally
representative surveys, the situation of intersex people cannot be analysed in this chapter.
This lack of evidence does not mean, however, that the inclusion of intersex people is a
minor issue. Evidence suggests that intersex people constitute a sizeable minority. To date,
two studies have tried to provide a comprehensive estimate of the intersex population,
based on a meta-analysis of medical research articles. Their measure varies from 0.5%
(van Lisdonk, 2014[3]) to 1.7% (Blackless et al., 2000[4]) of the total population.

1.1. How many people are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender?
No census has ever asked questions on sexual orientation and/or gender identity to
identify LGB and transgender people, and only a few nationally representative surveys
contain such questions. The bulk of population-based surveys identify the LGBT
population in an indirect way, namely through the sex of the respondent’s partner. But this
approach focuses on individuals who live with a same-sex partner, a group that is not
representative of the LGBT population as a whole.
To date, only 15 OECD countries have included a question on sexual self-identification
in at least one of their nationally representative surveys conducted by national statistical
offices or other public institutions. These countries are: Australia, Canada, Chile, Denmark,
France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, the United
Kingdom and the United States. By asking individuals how they think of themselves (with

the following options available: “Heterosexual”, “Homosexual”, “Bisexual”, “Other”, “Don’t
know” and “Refused”), the question on sexual self-identification allows targeting people
who self-identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual. The United States have been the most active
in collecting this information, with at least 10 nationally representative surveys collecting
information on sexual self-identification.
In the 14 OECD countries where estimates are available,2 LGB people account for 2.7%
of the adult population on average (Figure 1.1). In other words, in these 14 OECD countries,
at least 17 million adults self-identify as LGBT – 17 million adults is a lower bound since
transgender people are not counted due to data gaps (see Section 1.1.2) –, which is as large
as the total population of Chile or the Netherlands.

1.1.1. Zooming in on LGB people
Further analysis of the estimates of the LGB population reported in Figure 1.1 shows a
fairly equal breakdown across homosexuals and bisexuals, with the exception of Chile,
Germany and Sweden. The proportion of homosexuals within the LGB population ranges
from 44% in France to 58% in Norway (Figure 1.2). Women are as likely to report a LGB
identity as their male counterparts. But this pattern masks heterogeneity across LGB
subgroups: compared to men, women are less likely to self-identify as homosexual, but
more likely to self-identify as bisexual.
Variation in the share of LGB people across countries critically depends on LGB
people’s willingness to answer questions dealing with sexual self-identification, in a
context where heterosexuality is still widely perceived as the norm or default sexual
orientation. Consequently, survey methods that do not provide respondents with a
sufficient sense of privacy, i.e. when the survey is based on computer-assisted personal
interviewing or computer-assisted telephone interviewing, have proven to generate
substantial underreporting of an LGB identity (Valfort, 2017[1]).

Data underlying Figure 1.1 confirm that estimates of the LGB population are
significantly higher when they originate from surveys where the question on sexual
self-identification is completed by the respondent, rather than by the interviewer.
This pattern holds even within the same country: of the eight US-based representative
surveys for which LGB data are publicly available, four ask the question on sexual
self-identification in the framework of a self-administered module. They reveal a share of
LGB people equal to 4.6%, as opposed to 2.9% when attention is restricted to the four
surveys that exclusively rely on computer-assisted personal interviewing or computerassisted telephone interviewing.
Although they allow for identifying people who view themselves as lesbian, gay or
bisexual, questions on sexual self-identification underestimate the share of people who
are LGB from a more objective point of view, i.e. based on their sexual behaviour or sexual
attraction (Box 1.2). The size of the LGB population is 70% larger when it is calculated based
on individuals’ sexual behaviour (instead of individuals’ sexual self-identification), and
more than twice as large when sexual attraction is taken as a criteria (Figure 1.3).
That the share of LGB people reaches its maximum with measures of sexual attraction
and its minimum with measures of sexual self-identification is not surprising. Sexual
attraction is indeed a more inclusive concept than sexual behaviour, which is itself more
inclusive than sexual self-identification: not all people who feel attracted to same-sex
people engage in same-sex sexual behaviour, and not all people who engage in same-sex
sexual behaviour view themselves as lesbian, gay or bisexual. But another explanation
flows from the observation that LGB people are more likely to refrain from disclosing who
they are if they are asked to self-identify as lesbians, gay men or bisexuals, rather than
specify the sex of the persons with whom they have sex or to whom they feel sexually
attracted (Coffman, Coffman and Ericson, 2017[5]).

Box 1.2. Asking questions about sexual orientation in surveys
Respondents’ sexual orientation can be measured through three different types of
questions (Williams Institute, 2009[6]):
●

Questions on sexual self-identification
❖ They capture how the respondent identifies his/her sexual orientation
❖ They typically read as follows: Which of the following options best describes how you think
of yourself?
– Straight (Heterosexual)
– Gay or Lesbian (Homosexual)
– Bisexual
– Other
– Don’t know/Refused
❖ Questions on sexual self-identification are asked in the framework of nationally
representative surveys conducted by public institutions in 15 OECD countries (Annex
Table 1.A.1).

●

Questions on sexual behaviour
❖ They capture the sex of the respondent’s sex partner(s)
❖ They typically read as follows: In the past [time period e.g. year] who have you had sex
with?
– I have exclusively had female sex partners
– I have had mostly female sex partners and at least one male sex partner
– I have had approximately equal numbers of female and male sex partners
– I have had mostly male sex partners and at least one female sex partner

– I have had sex with neither women nor men
– Don’t know/Refused
❖ Among the 30 nationally representative surveys reported in Annex Table 1.A.1,

Questions on sexual attraction
❖ They capture the sex of people the respondent feels sexually attracted to
❖ They typically read as follows: In the past [time period e.g. year] who have you felt sexually
attracted to?
– Only attracted to females
– Mostly attracted to females
– Equally attracted to females and males

– I have never felt sexually attracted to anyone at all
– Don’t know/Refused
❖ Among the 30 nationally representative surveys reported in Annex Table 1.A.1,
10 include a question on sexual attraction.

1.1.2. What about transgender individuals?
Estimates of the transgender population remain scarce. To the best of our knowledge,
only three OECD countries collect information on gender identity in one of their nationally
representative surveys: the United States since 2013, Chile since 2015 and Denmark since
2017 (Annex Table 1.A.2).
Transgender individuals stand for a smaller minority than LGB people. Based on the
latest estimates available, their percentage in the adult population ranges from 0.1% in
Chile to 0.3% in the United States (estimates of the transgender population in Denmark
have not been released yet). Yet, these estimates do not rely on best-practices to collect
information on gender identity (Box 1.3).

Box 1.3. Asking questions about gender identity in surveys
There are different ways to identify transgender people in nationally representative surveys.
It can be done either through a one-step approach or through a multiple-step approach
(Williams Institute, 2014[7]):
●

In the one-step approach, the respondent is asked whether she considers herself to be
transgender (ideally by providing a clear definition of what “transgender” means), with
the following options available: “Yes, male-to-female transgender”; “Yes, female-to-male
transgender”; “Yes, gender-nonconforming transgender” (a person who does not
conform to either of the binary definitions of male or female); “No”; “Don’t know”,
“Refused”. This approach has been implemented by the Population Assessment of
Tobacco and Health survey in the United States since 2013.

1.

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

Box 1.3. Asking questions about gender identity in surveys (cont.)
●

A multiple-step approach should ideally include three stages. In the first stage, the
respondent is requested to report her assigned sex at birth: What sex were you assigned at
birth, on your original birth certificate? (with the following options available: “Male”, “Female”).
The second stage entails asking the respondent about her current gender identity: Which
gender do you identify with today? (with the following options available: “Male”, “Female”,
“Both male and female”, “Neither male nor female”, “Don’t know”, “Refused”). Finally, in
case the respondent provides different answers to the first two questions, the same
question as in the one-step approach should be asked: Do you consider yourself to be
transgender? This latter question is necessary to the extent that not all people who provide
a different answer to the “sex at birth” and “gender identity” questions would define
themselves as “transgender”. This third question also avoids counting as transgender
individuals who provide different answers simply due to misreporting. This approach has
been implemented by the “Project SEXUS” survey in Denmark since 2017.

1.1.3. The share of LGBT people is on the rise
The percentage of individuals who self-identify as homosexuals or bisexuals has been
increasing over time, which may reflect the general public becoming more open to LGBT
people. Figure 1.4 presents the evolution of the share of individuals who self-identify as
LGB, for a subset of surveys for which estimates of the LGB population in different survey
rounds are available. Over a period of seven years, which is the average period of time
between two survey rounds, this share rose by about 50%.

The Gallup Daily tracking survey offers another striking illustration that the share of
LGBT people is on the rise. Since 2012, this nationally representative survey has asked
nearly two million US adults whether they personally identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or

transgender. The results reveal a clear increasing trend: the share of people who selfidentify as LGBT rises from 3.5% in 2012 to 4.5% in 2017 (Figure 1.5). This trend is likely to
continue in the future, since it is driven by younger cohorts. In 2017, only 1.4% of people
born before 1945 consider themselves as LGBT, against 2.4% among baby boomers (born
between 1946 and 1964), 3.5% among Generation X (born between 1965 and 1979), and 8.2%
among millennials (born between 1980 and 1999).

1.2. How do LGBT people fare?
Previous studies have documented a shift toward greater acceptance of sexual and
gender minorities, but evidence suggests that there is still a long way to go before LGBT
people can benefit from full-fledged recognition (Valfort, 2017[1]). This section first analyses
attitudes toward LGBT people in OECD countries. It then investigates the extent of antiLGBT discrimination and explores how it affects LGBT people’s well-being.

1.2.1. Attitudes toward LGBT people
Cross-continent surveys on attitudes toward homosexuals have been conducted since
1981, while surveys on attitudes toward transgender people are more recent, with data first
collected in 2012. No nationwide or cross-country survey captures attitudes toward
bisexual people.

Acceptance of homosexuality and its evolution over time
There has been a shift toward greater acceptance of homosexuality, but homophobia
remains widespread. Even across OECD countries, which rank among the most tolerant
countries worldwide, the average respondent is only halfway to full social acceptance of
homosexuality, scoring five on a 1-to-10 acceptance scale (Figure 1.6; Box 1.4). This average
masks important disparities across countries, with the score of Iceland (8.3) more than five
times as high as that of Turkey (1.6). Yet, with the exception of a few countries, attitudes
toward homosexuality improved considerably over the past three decades.3

Box 1.4. Measuring acceptance of homosexuality on international surveys
Prominent cross-continent or regional surveys have included two different questions on
acceptance of homosexuality. The first captures the degree to which homosexuality is
considered as “justifiable”, on any ground, by the respondent: Please tell me whether you
think homosexuality can always be justified, never be justified, or something in between using this
card (the card being a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means that homosexuality is never
justifiable and 10 means that it is always justifiable). This question is part of a battery of
several questions about controversial behaviours and issues (e.g. abortion, divorce,
euthanasia, prostitution, etc.) that have been asked in the following cross-country surveys:
the AsiaBarometer, the European Values Survey, the Latinobarometro and the World
Values Survey. The second question reflects whether the respondent would be comfortable
with homosexuals as neighbours and has been asked in the AmericasBarometer, the
European Values Survey, the Latinobarometro and the World Values Survey. In principle,
the question asked by Gallup in their yearly cross-continent survey could be a third option:
Is the city or area where you live a good place or not a good place to live for gay or lesbian people?
However, this question provides less a measure of respondents’ own attitude toward
homosexuality than of their perception of local social acceptance of gay men and lesbians.
Moreover, this question has been asked only starting from the late 2000s, which limits the
possibility to study the evolution of attitudes toward homosexuals over time.
In this section, acceptance of homosexuality is computed based on the question on the
justifiability of homosexuality. Two reasons motivate this choice:
●

22

First, the wording of the question on the justifiability of homosexuality is the same
across surveys. This consistency is not the case for the question on acceptance of
homosexuals as neighbours. In fact, the AmericasBarometer is the only survey where
this question explicitly refers to “homosexuals”: Are you comfortable with homosexuals as
neighbours? (with the following options available: “Do not have a problem with having

Box 1.4. Measuring acceptance of homosexuality on international surveys
(cont.)
them as neighbours”, “Do not want them as neighbours”, “Don’t know” and “Refused”).
In the other surveys, respondents have to choose people they would not like to have as
neighbours, among a list that includes “homosexuals” or “gays”.
●

Second, answers to the question on the justifiability of homosexuality are easier to
interpret than answers to the question on acceptance of homosexuals as neighbours.
For the latter, no selection of the “homosexuals” or “gays” items by the respondents is
interpreted as equivalent to accepting homosexuals as neighbours. Yet, this omission
may reflect that the respondent considers these items as taboos, i.e. words to be
proscribed due to the unacceptable reality they depict.

Acceptance of homosexuality is greater among women, younger adults, the better
educated and people living in urban areas (Figure 1.7). The finding that women are more
open to homosexuality than men is explained by the more negative attitudes of men
toward gay men (Kite and Whitley, 1996[8]). In fact, men’s acceptance of lesbians is similar
to women’s acceptance of both lesbians and gay men.

Young people are also more likely to show positive views on homosexuality. While the
score on the “justifiability of homosexuality” scale reaches 6.0 (on a 1-to-10 acceptance scale)
for people aged between 15 and 29, this score drops to 4.4 for people above 50 (Figure 1.7).
These age differences can have two different causes: 1) an “ageing effect”, whereby
individuals become less accepting as they grow older; 2) a “cohort effect”, whereby younger
generations are exposed to social forces conducive to greater acceptance of sexual
minorities. Evidence to date suggests that the latter effect is at work. A recent study
provides a within-cohort analysis that reveals no substantial change in attitudes toward
SOCIETY AT A GLANCE 2019: OECD SOCIAL INDICATORS © OECD 2019

23

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

homosexuality over time and across a wide range of countries (Smith, Son and Kim, 2014[9]).
That said, older cohorts are not fully impervious to the spread of more liberal views on
homosexuality. An analysis of attitudinal changes in Canada and the United States
identifies remarkable improvements over time in acceptance of homosexuality within all
cohorts, which questions the conventional wisdom according to which opinions on
controversial social issues would be formed by early adulthood and change little with age
(Andersen and Fetner, 2008[10]).
Education seems to play a major role in explaining differences in attitudes toward
homosexuality: the score of individuals with a college education (6.1) is two points higher
than that of individuals who have, at most, a lower-secondary education (4.1) (Figure 1.7).
This result may be in part due to education’s correlation with complex reasoning that
increases individuals’ tolerance to nonconformity (Ohlander, Batalova and Treas, 2005[11]).
Finally, Figure 1.7 also reveals greater acceptance of homosexuality in urban than in
rural settings. Consistent with this finding, evidence shows that same-sex couples are
significantly more likely to locate in urban areas than do opposite-sex couples – Black,
Sanders, & Taylor (2007[12]) in the United States; Rault (2016[13]) in France; Kroh, Kühne,
Kipp, & Richter (2017[14]) in Germany.

Acceptance of transgender people
Only two cross-country surveys on attitudes toward transgender people have been
conducted thus far: the Special Eurobarometer on Discrimination collected by the European
Commission in 2012 and 2015, and the cross-continent survey conducted by the
International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) in 2016 (Box 1.5).

Box 1.5. Measuring acceptance of transgender people
in cross-country surveys
The Special Eurobarometer on Discrimination includes three questions on attitudes
toward transgender people:
●

Using a scale from 1 to 10, please tell me how you would feel about having a transgender or
transsexual person in the highest elected political position in [your country] – where “1” means
that the respondent would feel “not at all comfortable” and “10” that she would feel
“totally comfortable” (this question was asked both in 2012 and 2015)

●

Regardless of whether you are actually working or not, please tell me, using a scale from 1 to 10,
how comfortable you would feel if one of your colleagues at work was a transgender or
transsexual person (this question was asked only in 2015)

●

Regardless of whether you have children or not, please tell me, using a scale from 1 to 10, how
comfortable you would feel if one of your children was in a love relationship with a transgender
or transsexual person (this question was asked only in 2015)
The 2016 ILGA survey includes the following two questions:

●
●

If a male child always dressed and expressed himself as a girl, would you find that acceptable?
If a female child always dressed and expressed herself as a boy, would you find that acceptable?
Respondents could answer “Yes”, “No, or “Don’t know”.

The Special Eurobarometer on Discrimination covers 23 European OECD countries,
whereas the 2016 ILGA survey covers only 17 OECD countries. In both surveys, national
samples include an average of 1 000 respondents.

24

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

These surveys reveal widespread discomfort toward transgender people. Among
European OECD countries, an average of only 40% respondents would feel comfortable
having a transgender or transsexual person in the highest elected political position, as a
work colleague, or as a daughter- or son-in-law (Figure 1.8, Panel A). Moreover, less than
half (44%) of respondents in the 17 OECD countries covered by the 2016 ILGA survey would
accept a transgender child, noting a clear gender divide: a transgender child is at greater
risk of being rejected if she is male-to-female rather than female-to-male (Figure 1.8,
Panel B). That said, acceptance of transgender people remains higher in OECD countries
than elsewhere. Among the 37 non-OECD countries covered by the 2016 ILGA survey, only
25% of respondents would accept a transgender child.

The Special Eurobarometer on Discrimination indicates a modest shift toward greater
acceptance of transgender people (Figure 1.9). The share of respondents who report
comfort rises from 35% in 2012 to 40% in 2015. This average masks strong disparities,
though. Notably, six of the 23 European OECD countries experience a decrease in the share
of respondents who display positive attitudes toward a transgender or transsexual person
in the highest political office: Estonia (-10 percentage points), Denmark (-9 percentage
points), Germany (-3 percentage points), Lithuania (-4 percentage points), Luxembourg
(-8 percentage points) and Slovenia (-5 percentage points).

Socio-economic characteristics negatively correlated with homophobia also appear to
be negatively linked to attitudes towards transgender people: women, younger and more
educated people are more supportive of transgender people. Based on the 2015 Special
Eurobarometer, 56% of women report to be comfortable or indifferent with having a
transgender or transsexual person in the highest elected political office, compared with 48%
of men. Additionally, 62% of 15-24 year olds display comfort or indifference, as opposed to
45% of those aged 55 or over. Comfort levels are also stronger among the better educated:
59% of those who finished education at the age of 20 or older would be comfortable or
indifferent, compared with 44% of those who ended education at the age of 15 or younger.
The same pattern is observed for questions that address working with a transgender or
transsexual person, or having sons or daughters in a relationship with such a person – see
Norton & Herek (2013[15]) and Flores (2015[16]) for similar findings in the United States.

Comparing acceptance of homosexuality with acceptance of transgender people
Acceptance of homosexuality and acceptance of transgender people are strongly
correlated. Both attitudes toward homosexuals and attitudes toward transgender people are

shaped by how strongly one endorses the essentialist view that people fall into two distinct
gender identities (male and female) that match biological sex at birth and feel sexual
attraction to one another. Moreover, it is likely that the frontier between homosexuality and
a transgender identity is particularly fuzzy from the general public’s perspective.
Transgender people are indeed significantly more likely to self-identify as LGB (Downing and
Przedworski, 2018[17]).
Despite this correlation, comfort with transgender people appears lower than comfort
with LGB people. On average, 49% of respondents report comfort with LGB people, as
opposed to 40% who report comfort with transgender individuals (Figure 1.10).

the highest elected political position in [your country]; ii) regardless of whether you are actually working or not, please tell me, using a

1.2.2. Are LGBT people discriminated against?
Acceptance of homosexuals and transgender people by the general public remains
low, which puts LGBT people at risk of discrimination. This section explores three types of
evidence to shed light on whether sexual and gender minorities are indeed unfairly treated
compared to heterosexual and cisgender – antonym of transgender – individuals: the
perception of discrimination by LGBT people, the comparison of labour market outcomes
across LGBT and non-LGBT individuals based on survey data, and lessons from randomised
experiments.

Perception of discrimination by LGBT people
To date, only one cross-country survey has been conducted among LGBT people to
measure their perception of discrimination. This survey was performed in 2012 by the
European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. Data were collected through an
anonymous online questionnaire, among 93 079 people who self-identify as lesbian, gay,
bisexual and/or transgender across the EU.
On average, more than one out of three LGBT respondents in European OECD countries
report having personally felt discriminated against because of their sexual orientation and/or
gender identity. This share ranges from 50% in Lithuania to 31% in Denmark (Figure 1.11).
Consistent with attitudes toward LGB people being more positive than attitudes toward
transgender people, the perception of discrimination is higher on average among transgender
than among LGB individuals. Homosexuals report the highest level of discrimination in eight
countries: Austria, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia.

Comparing labour market outcomes of LGBT and non-LGBT people based
on representative survey data
Representative survey data reveal that LGBT people experience gaps in employment
status and/or labour earnings compared with non-LGBT people. LGBT people are 7% less
likely to be employed than non-LGBT people and their labour earnings are 4% lower
(Figure 1.12). They also seem to be exposed to a glass ceiling: they are 11% less likely to hold
a high managerial position. Overall, the penalty that LGBT individuals endure at school
(Box 1.6) extends into the labour market.

These estimates are computed based on 46 research papers published in academic journals or prominent discussion paper series that
cover 11 OECD countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and
the United States. LGB women, lesbians and bisexual women are compared to heterosexual women. LGB men, gay men and bisexual men
are compared to heterosexual men. For the employment gap, transgender women (i.e. male-to-female transgender people) are compared
to cisgender women, while transgender men (i.e. female-to-male transgender people) are compared to cisgender men. For the labour
earnings gap, transsexual women and transsexual men are compared to themselves before they transition to the other gender. The
category “LGBT” provides an average of the gaps computed for each subcategory of sexual and gender minorities.

Box 1.6. Homophobic and transphobic bullying at school is widespread
and hampers LGBT students’ educational achievements
Homophobic and transphobic bullying at school is a worldwide problem (UNESCO,
2016[22]). The victimisation of LGBT students ranges from the interference of homophobic
and transphobic discourse in everyday interactions (e.g. the use of “dyke”, “faggot” or
“tranny” as generalised derogatory comments among teenagers) to verbal harassment,
physical violence or cyberbullying. In the United States, 70.1% of LGBT students experienced
verbal harassment (e.g. called names or threatened) at school in the year preceding the 2017
National School Climate survey conducted among students between the ages of 13 and 21,
28.9% were physically harassed (e.g. pushed or shoved), 12.4% were physically assaulted
(e.g. punched, kicked, injured with a weapon), and 48.7% experienced electronic
harassment, via text messages or postings on social media (GLSEN, 2018[23]).
But discriminatory practices reported by LGBT students do not only stem from their peers.
They also involve teachers and, more generally, the school administration. For instance,
31.3% of LGBT students declared being disciplined for public displays of affection that were
not sanctioned among non-LGBT students. School policies and practices also target
transgender students: 42.1% had been prevented from using their preferred name or
pronoun and 46.5% had been required to use a bathroom of their legal sex (GLSEN, 2018[23]).

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

Box 1.6. Homophobic and transphobic bullying at school is widespread
and hampers LGBT students’ educational achievements (cont.)
Experimental data confirm this survey-based evidence: schools discriminate against LGBT
individuals, both as students and parents. In Serbia, an experiment was recently conducted
to evaluate discrimination in access to basic education against “feminine boys”. It reveals that
“feminine boys”, widely perceived as being gay, were at least three times more likely to be
refused enrolment in primary schools (15%) compared to boys not perceived to be feminine (5%).
Even when feminine boys were accepted, they met with twice as much hesitation and delay
in accepting their enrolment. In the case of non-feminine boys, this hesitation was often
linked to the boys’ school achievement and discipline, for feminine boys, on the other hand,
it was exclusively linked to their femininity (Koehler, Harley and Menzies, 2018[24]). In Spain,
another experiment examined whether schools are more reluctant to give information to
homosexual parents during children’s pre-registration period (Diaz-Serrano and Meix-Llop,
2016[25]). The authors created three types of fictitious couples (one heterosexual, one samesex male, and one same-sex female) and sent emails to schools in which these fictitious
couples made a request for an interview and a visit. The results point to substantial
discrimination against same-sex couples, a finding driven by the unfair treatment of
partnered gay men: while the callback rate of partnered lesbians is indistinguishable from
that of their heterosexual counterparts, the callback rate of heterosexual male couples is 50%
higher than the callback rate of same-sex male couples (67% vs 45%).
Few studies have examined how sexual minority youth fare in academic terms. Recently,
a study has taken full advantage of the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to
Adult Health. The results reveal that same-sex attraction or sexuality in adolescence is
associated with a lower probability of high school graduation, for both male and female
(Pearson and Wilkinson, 2017[26]).

However, these estimates must be taken with caution, since they likely constitute a
lower bound of the penalty faced by sexual and gender minorities. Evidence suggests that
LGBT people who disclose their sexual orientation and gender identity to the survey
enumerator are not representative of the LGBT population as a whole: only the better off
reveal who they are. For instance, among men who report having sex with men in the United
States, those of advantaged background are more likely to self-identify as homosexual or
bisexual (Barrett & Pollack (2005[19]); Pathela, et al. (2006[20])). Consistent with this finding,
analysis of nationally representative surveys shows that the share of individuals who answer
“Other”, “Don’t know” or “Refused” to the question on sexual self-identification is
disproportionately high among low-educated individuals.
The average penalty reported in Figure 1.12 masks important disparities across LGBT
subgroups. Homosexuals are the group for which the comparison of labour market outcomes
between LGBT and non-LGBT individuals yields the most contrasted results: lesbians benefit
from an employment and wage premium compared to heterosexual women, while gay men
suffer from an employment and wage penalty compared to heterosexual men. This result
presumably flows from differences in the way partners specialize in paid and unpaid work
across same-sex and opposite-sex couples: household specialisation is significantly lower
among same-sex partnerships (Valfort, 2017[1]).4 Consequently, a partnered homosexual
man is less involved in the labour market than a partnered heterosexual man, while a
partnered homosexual woman is more involved in the labour market than a partnered
heterosexual woman. By contrast, the labour market penalty exists for both bisexual women

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

and men. It is also pervasive among transgender and transsexual individuals, but only if they
are male-to-female.
Despite the difficulty to identify an employment and wage penalty for lesbians and gay
men, a body of complementary survey-based evidence suggests that both lesbians and gay
men face barriers in the labour market. Several studies have shown that female like male
homosexuals are less satisfied with their jobs than their heterosexual counterparts. They
report lower satisfaction with total pay, promotion prospects and respect received from their
supervisor, controlling for important characteristics such as education, occupation or mental
health (Valfort, 2017[1]). In Sweden, both gay men and lesbians display lower employment
rates in regions with more hostile attitudes toward homosexuals (Hammarstedt, Ahmed and
Andersson, 2015[21]).

Experimental evidence
The fact that survey-based evidence points to a penalty for LGBT people is not sufficient
to conclude that sexual and gender minorities are discriminated against. This penalty can
indeed flow from mechanisms that have nothing to do with anti-LGBT discrimination. For
instance, the fact that lesbians and gay men in Sweden display lower employment rates in
regions with more hostile attitudes toward homosexuals may simply reflect that more
productive lesbians and gay men are more likely to move out of regions showing low
acceptance of homosexuality.
To better measure anti-LGBT discrimination, experiments are key. In the labour market,
these experiments mainly take the form of “correspondence studies”. These studies consist
in sending out, in response to real job ads, the CVs and letters of application of fictitious
candidates who are identical save their sexual orientation or gender identity. Any difference
in the rate at which these fictitious candidates are invited to a job interview by employer is
interpreted as evidence of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
To date, 14 correspondence studies published in academic journals or discussion
paper series have been conducted in order to measure hiring discrimination against LGBT
applicants in OECD countries. These studies cover ten countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada,
France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States) and
have mainly been conducted within the last decade. Of these 14 studies, 13 test for hiring
discrimination against homosexual applicants. Only one correspondence study measures
hiring discrimination against (male-to-female) transgender applicants. None investigates
discrimination against bisexual applicants.
The 13 correspondence studies that test for hiring discrimination against homosexual
applicants rely on three different approaches to signal sexual orientation. The first approach,
used in nine of these 13 studies, consists in emphasizing the volunteer engagement or work
experience of the homosexual applicant in a gay and/or lesbian organisation, e.g. local Gay
People’s Alliance or gay and lesbian campus association – a volunteer engagement or work
experience in a control philanthropic organisation is typically mentioned in the CV of the
heterosexual applicant, that does not give any evidence of being gay or lesbian, e.g. Swedish
Red Cross or an environmental organisation. The second approach, implemented in two of
the 13 studies, entails stressing the sex of the candidate’s partner. This strategy is adopted in
countries where it is common to specify the partner’s first and last name on CV (e.g. the
Flanders region in Belgium or Germany). The third approach, performed in three of the
13 studies, relies on a weaker set of signals, such as mentioning the sex of the candidate’s

SOCIETY AT A GLANCE 2019: OECD SOCIAL INDICATORS © OECD 2019

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

partner in the letter of application, manipulating candidates’ sexual orientation on their
Facebook profile, or signalling the candidate’s participation in LGBT events not restricted to
LGBT participants, like the Gay Games.
Homosexual female and male applicants are 1.5 times less likely to be invited to a job
interview when sexual orientation is conveyed through their volunteer engagement or work
experience in a gay and/or lesbian organisation (Figure 1.13). By contrast, insisting on the
family prospects of female fictitious candidates by signalling homosexuality through the sex of
the candidate’s partner leads to the virtual disappearance of hiring discrimination against
lesbians. This pattern could reflect that employers attach a lower risk of maternity to lesbians
relative to heterosexual women and are therefore less inclined to discriminate against them –
see Petit (2007[27]) in France and Baert, De Pauw, & Deschacht (2016[28]) in Belgium for evidence
that women are discriminated against when they apply for a job at a childbearing age.

The difference in callback rate between fictitious heterosexual and homosexual
applicants is negatively correlated with acceptance of homosexuality by the general public. In
the United States, employers strongly discriminate against sexual minorities in the southern
and midwestern states (Texas, Florida, Ohio), whereas they tend to treat heterosexual and
homosexual candidates on an equal footing in the West and in the Northeast (California,
New York, Pennsylvania) known to be more open to LGBT people (Tilcsik, 2011 [29] ).
A correspondence study performed in two German cities characterised by opposite value
orientations, Munich and Berlin, provides similar findings. While the population in Munich
displays conservative attitudes, that of Berlin is known to support liberal views. The results
reflect this divide: homosexual applicants are discriminated against in Munich but not in
Berlin (Weichselbaumer, 2014[30]). Labour market discrimination against lesbians and gay men
also depends on the gender composition within the occupation tested. In Sweden, gay men are
discriminated against when they apply to male-dominated occupations (e.g. construction or

32

1.

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

mechanic worker), while these occupations are not particularly hostile to lesbians. Similarly,
lesbians are discriminated against when they apply to female-dominated occupations
(e.g. preschool teacher or nurse), but this is not the case for gay men (Ahmed, Andersson and
Hammarstedt, 2013[31]). In the United Kingdom, gay men receive fewer callbacks for vacancies
in which personality traits perceived as masculine are stressed in the job ad (i.e. the ideal job
applicant is described as “ambitious,” “assertive,” or “acting as a leader”). Conversely, lesbians
receive fewer invitations to job interviews for vacancies in which personality traits perceived
as feminine are emphasised, i.e. the ideal job applicant is described as “affectionate,”
“cheerful,” or “sensitive to the needs of others” (Drydakis, 2015[32]).
Some correspondence studies have detected wage discrimination, on top of hiring
discrimination. In Athens, this wage discrimination mainly penalizes lesbians: they are
offered a monthly wage that is 6% lower than that proposed to heterosexual women –
(Drydakis, 2009[33]) and (Drydakis, 2011[34]).5
Only one correspondence study investigated hiring discrimination on the ground of
gender identity (Bardales, 2013[35]). It compares the callback rate of fictitious male-to-female
transgender candidates with the callback rate of fictitious female cisgender candidates who
apply to high-skilled jobs in Texas. The results reveal strong discrimination against the trans
woman: the callback rate of the cisgender woman is 50% higher than hers. This result is
consistent with the findings of a small-scale experiment that was conducted in 2008 in the
Manhattan’s retail sector. Out of 24 employers tested, male-to-female, female-to-male and
gender-nonconforming transgender applicants were six times less likely than their cisgender
counterparts to receive a job offer: the job offer rate for the cisgender applicants was 50%, as
opposed to 8.3% for the transgender applicants (Make the Road New York, 2010[36]).
Overall, correspondence studies reveal substantial discrimination against LGBT
people, as does complementary experimental evidence outside the labour market (Box 1.7).
One could object that the experimental results reported here apply to only a subset of LGBT
individuals, those who are “out of the closet” in the labour market. But these results are
also valid for LGBT individuals who, although they do not disclose their sexual orientation

Box 1.7. Experimental evidence of discrimination against lesbians
and gay men outside the labour market
A range of field experiments have revealed substantial discrimination against lesbians and
gay men outside the labour market. In the rental housing market, correspondence studies
show that homosexual couples get fewer responses and invitations to showings from the
landlords than heterosexual couples, a result mainly driven by male same-sex partners – see
Ahmed, Andersson, & Hammarstedt (2008[38]) and Ahmed & Hammarstedt (2009[39]) in
Sweden; Lauster & Easterbrook (2011[40]) in Canada; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (2013[41]) in the United States and Koehler, Harley, & Menzies (2018[24]) in
Serbia. In Serbia, for instance, almost one in five (18%) of same-sex couples were refused
rental of an apartment by the landlord, while none of the opposite-sex couples were. This
average result masks strong disparities by gender: 29% of male same-sex couples were
rejected, as opposed to only 8% of female same-sex couples. The absence (or lower
magnitude) of discrimination against female same-sex couples could flow from landlords’
well documented preference for female rather than male tenants (Ahmed, Andersson and
Hammarstedt, 2008[38]). In this setting, the benefit of having two women as tenants could
counterbalance the perceived cost of renting to a lesbian couple.

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

Box 1.7. Experimental evidence of discrimination against lesbians
and gay men outside the labour market (cont.)
Gay men and lesbians are discriminated against in broader dimensions of their everyday
life. In the United States, David Jones sent letters from either a same-sex or opposite-sex
couple, requesting weekend reservations for a one-bed room in hotels and bed-andbreakfast establishments (Jones, 1996[42]). His results show that opposite-sex couples are
granted 20% more reservations than both male and female same-sex couples. Similarly,
Walters and Curran (1996[43]) performed an audit study where same-sex and opposite-sex
couples entered retail stores in the United States while an observer measures the time it
takes for the staff to welcome them. They find this time to be significantly less for
heterosexual than for both female and male homosexual couples who often were not
assisted and who were more likely to be repudiated. In the United Kingdom, various
experiments have also involved actors wearing a T-shirt with either a pro-gay slogan or
without any slogan. These actors approach passers-by asking them to provide change. The
findings point to less help provided to the ostensibly pro-gay person (Valfort, 2017[1]).
Sexual minorities appear unfairly treated even when they urgently need help. This
finding derives from experiments that apply the so-called “wrong number technique”. In
this approach, households receive apparently wrong-number telephone calls whereby the
caller explains his/her need for his/her interlocutor to deliver an urgent message to the
actual addressee of the call. More precisely, these experiments typically involve a male
(resp. female) caller who seeks to reach his girlfriend (resp. her boyfriend) in case of a
heterosexual relationship, or his boyfriend (resp. her girlfriend) in case of a homosexual
relationship. Indicating that his (resp. her) car has broken down and that he (resp. she) is
out of change at a pay phone, the caller requests help by asking the subject to call his (resp.
her) partner for him (resp. her). Results consistently show that perceived heterosexuals are
more likely to receive help than perceived homosexuals (Valfort, 2017[1]).
Other experiments use the so-called “lost-letter technique”. This approach consists of
dispersing in city streets a large number of unmailed letters. The letters are enclosed in
envelopes that have addresses and stamps on them but that have not yet been posted. When
a person comes across one of these letters on the street, it appears to have been lost. Thus
she has a choice of mailing, disregarding, or actively destroying the letter. By varying the
name of the organisation to which the letter is addressed and distributing such “lost letters”
in sufficient quantity, it is possible to obtain a return rate specific to the organisation. The
focus of the technique is not on the individual reaction to the lost letters but, rather, on the
rate of response for a particular organisation relative to other organisations that serve as
controls. Lost-letter experiments typically reveal a lower return rate for LGBT-related
organisations (Valfort, 2017[1]).

or gender identity, are perceived by their work environment as non-heterosexual or
non-cisgender. These cases may not be exceptions. Evidence suggests that individuals who
self-identify as homosexual are significantly more likely to be viewed as homosexual by
external observers not informed of their sexual orientation (Rule and Ambady, 2008[37]).
Similarly, a transgender identity may be detectable, even if it is not verbally disclosed. In
the EU, nearly two thirds of transgender do not avoid expressing their preferred gender
through their physical appearance and clothing (European Union Agency for Fundamental
Rights, 2014[18]). Moreover, the legal and preferred first names of transgender people often
conflict with each other, unless transgender people have gone through a legal process to

34

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

change their gender marker. This conflict is typically unveiled during the first job
interview, when recruiters ask for applicants’ identity documents and/or diplomas.

1.2.3. LGBT people’s well-being
The strong discrimination that LGBT people face put them at risk of low well-being.
This section first clarifies how stigma can impair mental health. It then explores
differences in health outcomes across LGBT and non-LGBT individuals. Finally, it shows
that lower psychological well-being among sexual and gender minorities does at least
partly flow from stigma.

Stigma and mental health
Sexual and gender minorities are widely exposed to stigma. LGBT people live in a
social environment that largely views heterosexuality and cisgender identity,
i.e. congruence between sex at birth and gender identity, as the only way of being normal.
LGBT people therefore experience stress not undergone by heterosexual and cisgender
individuals, the so-called minority stress (Meyer, 2003[44]).
This stress is suspected to seriously hamper sexual and gender minorities’ mental
health, by generating anxiety, depression, suicide ideation and attempt, substance use and
abuse: in short, low life satisfaction. But there is no need to undergo physical or verbal
violence for psychological distress to emerge. The fact that LGBT people feel forced to
conceal their own identity in order to avoid stigmatisation, and thus maintain separate
public and private personalities, is viewed as enough to generate mental health disorders.
This ill-being in turn has the potential to impair LGBT people’s physical health by providing
a fertile ground to other pathologies, such as cardiovascular diseases.
Stigma can negatively affect LGBT people’s health outcomes in a number of additional
ways. Such is discrimination from medical practitioners, low health insurance coverage, or
the obligation for some LGBT individuals to engage in hazardous occupations (Box 1.8).

Box 1.8. Stigma can impair LGBT people’s health outcomes,
beyond minority stress
First, medical practitioners are not exempt of negative feelings toward LGBT people – see
Sabin, Riskind, & Nosek (2015[45]) for the United States. Consistent with this finding, LGBT
individuals perceive significant discrimination from medical practitioners: 10% of LGBT living
in the EU who accessed healthcare in the year prior to the survey felt personally discriminated
against by healthcare personnel (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2014[18]).
Second, LGBT people experience a health insurance gap. Health insurance coverage is
indeed less likely to include an employee’s same-sex than opposite-sex partner. In the
United States, for instance, the legalisation of same-sex marriage in 2015 did not require
private employers to treat same-sex and opposite-sex spouses on an equal footing. In 2018,
more than one third of employers offering health insurance to opposite-sex spouses were
not offering this benefit to same-sex spouses, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.6
Third, stigma both within and outside the family compels some LGBT individuals to
engage in hazardous occupations. A recent study in Italy finds that past experiences of
discrimination are strongly correlated with transgender people’s decision to become sex
workers (D’Ippoliti and Botti, 2017[46]). Consistent with this finding, transgender people are
overrepresented among prostitutes (Valfort, 2017[1]).

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

The mental health of LGBT people
Mental health disorders are more frequent among LGB than heterosexual individuals
(Figure 1.14). For instance, LGB respondents are more than twice as likely to have ever been
diagnosed with a depressive disorder (Germany), nearly three times as likely to have
experienced a major depressive episode in the year preceding the survey (United States), and
nearly ten times as likely to have attempted suicide in that past year (Sweden). These gaps
remain significant even when one controls for a wide range of individual characteristics.
Results from wave 2015 of the NSDUH in the United States also confirm LGB people’s greater
likelihood of substance use and abuse (Figure 1.15). Not surprisingly, LGB individuals are also
significantly less likely to have optimal cardiovascular health compared to heterosexuals –
Saxena, et al. (2018[47]) in the United States. Overall, homosexuals and bisexuals present
lower scores on a life satisfaction scale than do their heterosexual counterparts (Figure 1.16).
Bisexuals show worse mental health outcomes and life satisfaction than homosexuals,
perhaps because they are more prone to “stay in the closet”, i.e. conceal who they are from
others – Pew Research Center (2013[48]) in the United States; European Union Agency for
Fundamental Rights (2014[18]) in the EU.

Representative samples show that transgender individuals are also at a much higher
risk of mental health disorders than their cisgender counterparts (Downing and
Przedworski, 2018 [17] ). The higher risk is prevalent for all categories of transgender
individuals – female to male, male to female and gender non-conforming. On average,
transgender individuals are around twice as likely as their cisgender counterparts to:
i) have ever been diagnosed with a depressive disorder; ii) have had more than 14 days of
poor mental health including stress, depression, and problems with emotions in the past

30 days; iii) have had serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, and making decisions
because of physical, mental, or emotional conditions. They are also nearly twice as likely
as their cisgender counterparts to have been diagnosed with a coronary heart disease or
myocardial infarction.
Transsexuals, i.e. transgender who have undergone hormone-replacement therapy
and sex-reassignment surgery, are no exception. Based on administrative Swedish data,
transsexuals are nearly 3 times more exposed to psychiatric inpatient care than their
non-transsexual counterparts (Dhejne et al., 2011[49]). Additionally, they show a three-fold
higher mortality risk, particularly due to death by suicide – they are nearly eight times as
likely to attempt suicide – and by cardiovascular disease.

Is stigma at play?
A rapidly growing literature is trying to identify a causal impact of stigma on LGBT
people’s mental health. In the United States, for instance, various studies have taken
advantage of the sequential adoption or ban of same-sex marriage across US states (Valfort,
2017[1]). One study shows that LGB people living in states that passed constitutional
amendments banning same-sex marriage in 2004 experienced significant increases in mood,
anxiety, and substance disorders, which was not the case of LGB individuals living in states
without these amendments. A complementary analysis that focuses on health care use
reveals that, in the twelve months after the enactment of laws permitting same-sex
marriage in Massachusetts in 2003, sexual minority men (women are absent from the
sample) had a statistically significant decrease in medical care and mental health care visits
and costs. Similar findings emerge outside the United States. A recent study exploits the
implementation in late 2017 of a national plebiscite on same-sex marriage legislation in
Australia and interpret the share of “No” voters at the electorate level as a measure of stigma.
They show that LGB people report comparatively worse life satisfaction, mental health and
overall health in constituencies with higher shares of “No” voters (Perales and Todd, 2018[52]).
One could argue, however, that these results are driven by confounding factors, e.g. state
characteristics that change concomitantly to the adoption of LGBTI-inclusive laws. To
address these issues, a control group composed of heterosexuals in order to run a
comparative analysis of LGB health outcomes over time is needed. Such a “difference-indifference” approach confirms that stigma undermines the mental health of sexual
minorities: in the United States, the reduction in the number of suicide attempts between
LGB and heterosexual youth is substantially higher in states that adopted same-sex marriage
than in others – a trend that was not apparent before the implementation of LGB-inclusive
policies. Same-sex marriage policies cause a reduction by nearly 15% of suicide attempts
among adolescents who self-identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual (Raifman et al., 2017[53]).

1.3. What policies can improve LGBT inclusion?
Ensuring that LGBT individuals can openly express their sexual orientation and
gender identity without being stigmatised, discriminated against, or attacked should be a
policy priority, for at least three reasons. The first and most important reason is obviously
ethical. Sexual orientation and gender identity are integral aspects of our selves.
Guaranteeing that LGBT people are not condemned to forced concealment or retaliation
when their identity is revealed should constitute an inalienable human right. The second
reason is economic. Exclusion of LGBT people impedes economic development through a
wide range of channels, such as lower investment in human capital, reduced output and

38

1.

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

productivity, public spending on social and health services that might be better spent
elsewhere. The third reason why LGBT inclusion should constitute a priority is social. LGBT
inclusion is viewed as conducive to the emergence of less restrictive gender norms that
improve gender equality broadly speaking and, hence, expand social and economic roles,
especially for women. Consistent with this intuition, acceptance of homosexuality is
strongly correlated with support for gender equality worldwide (Figure 1.17).

always be justified, never be justified, or something in between, using this card” (the card being a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means that
homosexuality is never justifiable and 10 means that it is always justifiable). Support for gender equality is an average of responses to the
following three EVS/WVS questions: “When jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women.” (=1 if agree, =2 if neither
agree nor disagree, =3 if disagree); “On the whole, men make better political leaders than women do.” (=1 if strongly agree, =2 agree, =3 if
disagree, =4 if strongly disagree), “A university education is more important for a boy than for a girl” (=1 if strongly agree, =2 agree, =3 if
disagree, =4 if strongly disagree).
The group “OECD” includes all OECD Member countries, with the exception of Israel and Slovak Republic where information on support
for gender equality is missing.

1.3.1. Making LGBT individuals and the penalties they face visible in national statistics
Improving awareness that LGBT individuals constitute a sizeable minority that is
discriminated against is an important prerequisite in order to improve their inclusion.
Greater publicity of discriminatory behaviour can indeed bring meaningful change, in
particular through greater self-control of discriminating individuals. For example, two US
economists, Joseph Price and Justin Wolfers, published a study in 2002 demonstrating the
existence of racial discrimination during National Basketball Association (NBA) games (Price
and Wolfers, 2010[54]). In 2007, these results received considerable media attention (frontpage coverage in the New York Times, radio and TV shows including comments from star
basketball players, etc.). This media coverage allowed for putting an end to the racial
discrimination it pinpointed: referees went on discriminating against opposite-race players
until this bias became public, but they stopped discriminating afterwards. Complementary
evidence suggests that this shift did not flow from dramatic institutional changes (firing of
certain referees, changes in how referees are assigned to games, etc.). Rather, it is consistent

SOCIETY AT A GLANCE 2019: OECD SOCIAL INDICATORS © OECD 2019

39

1.

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

with referees engaging in voluntary behavioural change after becoming aware of their own
bias (Pope, Price and Wolfers, 2018[55]) – see Alesina, Carlana, Ferrara, & Pinotti (2018[56]) for
similar findings among Italian schoolteachers.
Collecting information on sexual orientation and gender identity in censuses as well
as national labour force, health and victimisation surveys is critical to create awareness. As
it has already been stressed, only a minority of OECD countries (15) have included such
questions in at least one of their nationally representative surveys, and even fewer
(11 countries) do so on a regular basis. Yet, these countries constitute helpful precedents
that contribute to disseminate good practices on how to best collect such sensitive
information. The United Kingdom is, for instance, planning to include a question on sexual
self-identification in its 2021 census. To that end, the Office for National Statistics has run
a census test in 2017 whose lessons are enlightening for the United Kingdom and beyond
(Box 1.9).

Box 1.9. Lessons from the 2017 census test in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom is planning changes for the 2021 census. In particular, the upcoming
census will be, for the first time, a self-completed online questionnaire that aims to include
the following question on sexual self-identification: “Which of the following options best
describes how you think of yourself? (this question is voluntary)”, with the following options:
“Heterosexual or Straight”; “Gay or Lesbian”; “Bisexual”; “Other (please specify)”.
As part of the preparation, the United Kingdom conducted a field test in England and
Wales in 2017: the census test. The census test involved a total of 208 000 households that
were subject to a questionnaire with the sexual self-identification question in the
treatment group, and without this question in the control group. The census test was
followed by a census test evaluation survey, in particular to provide further understanding
of how people feel about the inclusion of a question on sexual orientation. Complete and
valid interviews were carried out with 1 839 people who also responded to the census test,
and with 991 people who did not respond to the census test.
The purpose of both tests was to examine potential concerns around public
acceptability and data quality. The Office for National Statistics aimed to explore whether
including the question had an effect on response rates for other questions. They also
investigated i) whether the question on sexual self-identification itself had a high
non-response rate, ii) whether it produced estimates that were comparable to the Annual
Population Survey.
Public acceptability
The overall response rate for those who received the sexual orientation question was
38.6%. It was 39.0% for people whose questionnaire did not include this question. This is a
difference of 0.4 percentage points, less than the maximum tolerance of 2 percentage
points that coincides with thresholds set by the Office for National Statistics when testing
new sensitive questions in previous censuses. Furthermore, the drop-off rate (people who
stop completing the survey) at this question was very low: it was less than one in
1 500 responses. This suggests that this question does not stand out compared with the
other questions. In fact, the sexual orientation question had similar online drop-off rates
to the ethnic group question. Both of these have lower drop-off rates than the religion and
national identity questions.

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

Box 1.9. Lessons from the 2017 census test in the United Kingdom (cont.)
Data quality
Data quality critically depends on the level of item non-response (those who responded to
the census test but did not complete the sexual self-identification question) and comparability
with other sources (namely the Annual Population Survey). The level of item non-response for
the sexual self-identification question was 8.4%, which is less than the 10% threshold set by
the Office for National Statistics for a voluntary question. This is more, however, than the item
non-response for a similar question asked in the 2016 Annual Population Survey, probably
because respondents were also offered the option “Don’t know” in this survey, which is not the
case of the question tested in the census test. For that reason, the Office for National Statistics
is planning to add the option “Prefer not to say” to that question. Despite this higher item
non-response rate, the population identifying as gay, lesbian or bisexual in the census test
(2.4%) was similar to the estimate in the 2016 Annual Population Survey (2.0%).
Overall, results from the census test suggest that including a question on sexual selfidentification in the 2021 census would not significantly impact overall response and that
responses to this question are of acceptable quality. That said, results from the census test
evaluation survey point to further work to improve quality and notably reduce the item
non-response. For example, some members of the public did not answer the question
because they did not understand why the information was needed. Others stated that the
information is personal and private. To address these issues, the Office for National Statistics
plans to review the question guidance explaining the reasons for asking this question, and
to reiterate messages about the confidentiality of interviewees’ responses.
Source: Office for National Statistics (2018[58]).

An alternative strategy is to run a victimisation survey among a sufficiently large
nationally representative sample of respondents in order to include a significant share of LGBT
individuals and, hence, analyse their exposure to stigmatisation, discrimination and attacks,
as compared to non-LGBT individuals. In France, the inter-ministerial body in charge of
combating racism, anti-semitism and anti-LGBT hatred mandated the opinion poll company
IFOP to run a self-administered online questionnaire among a representative sample of
12 137 respondents in 2018: 994 respondents (8.2%) self-identified as LGBT with the majority
(53%) reporting exposure to verbal and physical violence at least once in their lifetime due to
their sexual orientation or gender identity. Such a sample is also conducive to analyse
employment and/or health disparities across LGBT and non-LGBT respondents. To learn more
about experiences of sexual and gender minorities, it is also possible to run a survey that
specifically targets LGBT individuals. In 2017, the UK government asked LGBT people to answer
an online survey about different parts of their lives. More than 108 000 completed the survey,
making it the largest national survey of its kind anywhere in the world. Results show that,
although the United Kingdom has a proud record in advancing LGBT rights, many LGBT
respondents report facing discrimination. Overall, just over half of the respondents said they
were comfortable being LGBT in the United Kingdom, with transgender respondents
expressing the lowest comfort (Government Equalities Office, 2018[57]).

1.3.2. Enforcing anti-discrimination and equality laws
Legally prohibiting anti-LGBT discrimination and ensuring equal rights to LGBT
individuals is essential for their inclusion. One cannot expect to improve the situation of
sexual and gender minorities if, to begin with, the law does not protect them against
SOCIETY AT A GLANCE 2019: OECD SOCIAL INDICATORS © OECD 2019

41

1.

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

discrimination and abuses. As an illustration, LGBT employees report lower perceived
discrimination and are more comfortable being open about their sexual orientation in firms
that ban discrimination against them. LGBT employees also declare greater job commitment,
improved workplace relationships, increased job satisfaction and better health outcomes in
these settings. Consistent with these findings, the labour earnings penalty of sexual minorities
is lower in localities or firms that protect them from discrimination (Valfort, 2017[1]).
However, there is still a long way before sexual and gender minorities meet fullfledged legal recognition. For instance, only a minority of countries worldwide (37%)
prohibit discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation (ILGA, 2017[59]), as
compared to more than two thirds that prohibit discrimination in employment based on
gender, race, religion or disability.7 The share of countries worldwide that have legalised
same-sex marriage is even lower (14%). OECD countries perform better than the worldwide
average, but they still are not the champions of LGBT-inclusive laws. For instance, only a
small majority (56%) have legalised same-sex marriage in at least parts of their national
territory (Figure 1.18). Moreover, enacting anti-discrimination and equality laws is not
sufficient per se to protect sexual and gender minorities. These laws must also be fully
enforced, meaning that reporting, recording and sanctioning of anti-LGBT offences at
home, at work, on the street, online, etc. should become more systematic.

Enactment and enforcement of anti-discrimination and equality laws improve LGBT
inclusion not only by discouraging potential offenders, but also by shaping the social norm.
Individuals perceive legal changes as reflecting evolutions in what is socially acceptable and

1.

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

are willing to conform to these shifts (Tankard and Paluck, 2017[60]). Same-sex marriage or
same-sex couples adoption legislation is strongly correlated with acceptance of
homosexuality – see Hooghe & Meeusen (2013[61]) and Takács, Szalma, & Bartus (2016[62]) in
Europe. While countries with greater acceptance of homosexuality are more likely to legalise
same-sex marriage, evidence shows that legal changes do cause changes in attitudes. In
Europe, for instance, acceptance of homosexuality increased much faster in countries where
same-sex marriage is legal after those countries adopted same-sex relationship recognition
policies (Aksoy et al., 2018[63]) – see Kreitzer, Hamilton, & Tolbert (2014[64]) and Flores &
Barclay (2016[65]) for similar findings in the United States.

1.3.3. Educating people in countering their unconscious biases
Discrimination largely flows from unconscious biases (Kahneman, 2013 [66] ).
Unconscious biases lead us to judge positively, even before we get to know them, people who
are similar to us, and to “prejudge” negatively the others. Unconscious biases also largely
account for stereotypes’ inaccuracy. Individuals tend to overestimate the weaknesses of
dissimilar others and to underestimate their strengths, while they are prone to the opposite
in face of similar others. Overall, unconscious biases contribute to minority groups, LGBT
people included, being discriminated against by the majority.
Unconscious bias training should constitute a key component of any policy package
aiming to improve LGBT inclusion. This training consists in making individuals aware of
their unconscious prejudices and stereotypes and teaching them how to overcome them.
Increasing attention is being devoted to training recruiters, managers and employees at
large. In the Netherlands, the not-for-profit foundation Workplace Pride has developed
LGBT inclusion training material directed at companies all over the world. In France, the
2017 Law “Equality and Citizenship” has made this training compulsory for people in
charge of recruitment and human resources management in firms with 300 employees and
above. In the United Kingdom, the Government Equalities Office is developing a training
package to help employers and employees deal with LGBT discrimination in the workplace.
Prejudice-reducing interventions at school are also critical, in order to counter unconscious
biases at an early stage and combat homophobic and transphobic bullying at school that
has proven to be a worldwide problem. As of today, half of European OECD countries are
engaged in reducing negative representations of LGBT people among pupils, and/or in
training teachers on how to create an LGBT-inclusive environment in the class (Box 1.10).
That said, these actions are rarely compulsory and often restricted to specific cities or
regions.
Evidence on the impact of de-biasing interventions in everyday life is scarce but shows
that these interventions can be highly effective, even when they are short (Broockman and
Kalla, 2016[67]). This result stems from the unique randomised field experiment on the
topic. It was carried out in the context of a door-to-door operation in Florida in 2014, after
the Miami-Dade County Commission passed an ordinance protecting transgender people
from discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations. Fearing that
this decision be submitted to citizens’ vote and repealed, LGBT associations went door to
door to have conversations with Miami-Dade voters. The results show that this brief doorto-door intervention has made voters much more open and benevolent to transgender
people, and more prone to endorse the ordinance prohibiting discrimination against
transgender people if asked to. These effects were still visible three months after the doorto-door operation.

organisations (e.g. SOS homophobie) that are accredited by the government as
“complementary associations of public education” to design school-based interventions for
reducing anti-LGBT prejudice among pupils and train school staff. These interventions and
training are optional.
Germany
Some federal states are active. In Saarland, the LSVD-Saar (“Lesbian and Gay Federation in
Germany”) delivers school-based classes by gay and lesbian young people to talk about LGBT
inclusion with the pupils. In Brandenburg, the project “Schule unterm Regenbogen” offers
trainings for teachers on LGBT awareness. The state government of Berlin financially
supports LGBT civil society organisations to provide training and educational materials for
teachers, and school workshops for students.
Iceland
Samtökin ’78, the national queer organisation, has a contract with the Municipality of
Reykjavík which includes financial support in exchange for extensive LGBT education in
schools. There is also a new contract with the municipality of Hafnarfjörður which
includes financial support in exchange for extensive teacher training as well as peer
education for students. These are only two municipalities out of 75, but they are two of the
largest ones.
Ireland
BeLonG To Youth Services, the national organisation supporting LGBT young people,
provides non-mandatory training to professional educational services such as the
professional development service for teachers in the national educational psychological
service, and the education welfare service.
Italy
The activities of several civil society organisations a (Arcigay, Famiglie Arcobaleno,
Arcilesbica, Agedo, Rete degli Studenti Medi, Progetto Alice, Scosse, Uaar, Unar) are supported by
the government, in particular for the creation of campaigns or workshops in schools. In
some cities and regions, associations are supported to create curricular or extracurricular
activities for students and teachers.

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

Box 1.10. LGBT-inclusive education policies in European
OECD Member countries (cont.)
Luxembourg
Civil society organisations and the Institut de Formation de l’Education Nationale (IFEN)
offer various optional teacher and socio-educational staff trainings on creating
LGBT-inclusive environment at school.
Netherlands
Civil society organisations (e.g. COC Netherlands or EduDivers) are active in training
teachers on LGBT awareness, although this training is only optional.
Norway
The current action plan Safety, diversity, openness (2016) focuses on the topic of an
inclusive and safe psychosocial environment in schools for LGBT children and youth.
Portugal
The government provides periodic support to local civil society organisations. The LGBT
youth NGO Rede Ex Aequo received funding to produce materials for teachers and students,
as well as a specific one-year project including teacher training and an awareness raising
campaign with posters and postcards. In 2017, with the support of public funding, ILGA
Portugal started a two-year project aimed at the creation of alliances in school context, with
several partnerships, including municipalities, other NGOs, and victim support services.
Sweden
All teachers must achieve 60 credits of basic education science. As part of this compulsory
training, they receive information on how to prevent and tackle discrimination in schools. In
particular, the National Agency for Education provides training that specifically addresses
the inclusion of LGBT people in the class. Civil society organisations, like RFSL, offer specific
workshops and deliver a certificate of competency to teachers who participate.
Switzerland
The Department of Education of Geneva provides support to civil society organisations
and partnership agreements to set-up specific programmes to prevent homophobia,
biphobia and transphobia in schools in Geneva.
United Kingdom
Some universities or schools provide teacher training, often in collaboration with civil
society organisations. In England, Stonewall, offers training to universities. Moreover, LGBT
Youth Scotland works with six of the eight teacher training universities in Scotland. Through
lectures, workshops and seminars, trainee teachers are signposted to LGBT inclusion
resources. For the majority of these institutions this work is not mandatory, but each year,
roughly 1 500 trainee teachers access these sessions. This work is currently funded by the
Scottish Government.

THE LGBT CHALLENGE: HOW TO BETTER INCLUDE SEXUAL AND GENDER MINORITIES?

Notes
1. In Hungary, the Constitution prohibits same-sex marriage since 2012. In the Slovak Republic, the
Parliament approved a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in June 2014. In the
United States, according to a draft memo leaked to The New York Times, the Department of Health
and Human Services proposes to establish a legal definition of whether someone is male or female
based solely and immutably on the genitals they are born with.
2. Estimates from Project SEXUS that was launched in 2017 in Denmark have not been released yet.
3. The Czech Republic, Greece and Italy are the only three OECD countries characterised by a decrease
in acceptance of homosexuality. However, this pattern is likely a statistical artefact. These three
countries have hosted only one survey during the 2001-2014 period, while more than two have been
conducted on average in the other OECD countries. Consequently, estimates for the 2001-2014 period
are based on a much lower average number of observations (N=1,444 for the Czech Republic, Greece
and Italy as opposed to N=3,044 in the other OECD countries).
4. This result holds even when the effect of differences in the number of children across same-sex
and opposite-sex couples is neutralized.
5. These correspondence studies test for wage discrimination by having actors inquire about the
monthly wage offer, whenever recruiters call fictitious candidates back to invite them to a job
interview. Although this experimental set-up is informative about differences in wages offered by
the recruiter before the job interview, it remains silent about a potential wage discrimination
against homosexual applicants at the hiring stage, as well as during their stay in the firm.
6. See “Access to employer-sponsored health coverage for same-sex spouses: 2018 update” on
www.kff.org.

Interpreting OECD Social Indicators

The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli
authorities. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights,
East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law.

INTERPRETING OECD SOCIAL INDICATORS

2.1. The purpose of Society at a Glance
Society at a Glance 2019 aims to address the growing demand for quantitative evidence
on the social situation, its trends, and its possible drivers across OECD countries. One
objective is to assess and compare social outcomes that are currently the focus of policy
debates. Another is to provide an overview of societal responses, and how effective policy
actions have been in furthering social development. This edition of Society at a Glance
discusses the challenges lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender (LGBT) face in OECD
countries. Indicators on LGBT people receive therefore a particular focus.
The indicators are based on a variant of the “Pressure-State-Response” framework that has
also been used in other policy areas (United Nations [1997], Glossary of Environment Statistics,
Studies in Methods, Series F, No. 67, New York). This groups indicators into three areas:
●

“Social context”: refers to general indicators that, while not usually direct policy targets
are relevant information for understanding the social landscape. An example is the
proportion of elderly people to working-age people.

●

“Social status”: describes the social outcomes that policies try to influence. Ideally, the
selected indicators can be easily and unambiguously interpreted. As an example all
countries would rather have low poverty rates than high ones.

●

“Societal response”: provides information about measures and activities to affect social
status indicators. Examples are governmental policies, but also activities of NGOs,
families and broader civil society.

In addition, the framework used in Society at a Glance groups social status and societal
response indicators according to the broad policy fields they cover:
●

“self-sufficiency”

●

“equity”

●

“health status”

●

“social cohesion”.

A related OECD publication, How’s Life? Measuring Well-being, presents a large set of
well-being indicators, with an aim to give an accurate picture of societal well-being and
progress. Compared with Society at a Glance, How’s Life? uses a broader set of outcome
measures but excludes indicators of policy responses. In addition, the special chapter in
Society at a Glance provides policy analysis and recommendations.
OECD countries differ substantially in their collection and publication of social
indicators. In selection of indicators for this report, the following questions were
considered.
●

58

What is the degree of indicator comparability across countries? This report strives to present
the best comparative information for each of the areas covered. However, the indicators
presented are not confined to those for which there is “absolute” comparability. Readers
are alerted to the nature of the data used and the limits to comparability.

SOCIETY AT A GLANCE 2019: OECD SOCIAL INDICATORS © OECD 2019

2. INTERPRETING OECD SOCIAL INDICATORS

●

What is the minimum number of countries for which the data must be available? This report
includes only primary indicators that are available for two thirds of OECD countries.

●

What breakdowns should be used at a country level? Social indicators can often be decomposed
at a national level into outcomes by social sub-categories, such as people’s age, gender
and family type. Pragmatism governs here: the breakdowns presented vary according to
the indicator considered, and are determined by what is readily available.

Chapters 3 to 8 describe the key evidence. Some of these indicators are published by
the OECD on a regular basis (e.g. Social Expenditure Database and OECD Health Statistics).
Others have been collected on an ad hoc basis or involve transformation of existing
indicators.

2.2. The selection and description of indicators
2.2.1. Risks That Matter
To find out more about people’s perceptions of social and economic risks and how well
they think their government reacts to those risks, the OECD launched in 2018 a brand-new
cross-national survey – the OECD Risks That Matter Survey (see Chapter 3). The survey is a
cross-national survey that examines people’s perceptions of social and economic risks and
how well they think government addresses those risks. The survey draws on a representative
sample of 22 000 people aged 18-to-70-year olds in 21 OECD countries: Austria, Belgium,
Canada, Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Ireland, Italy,
Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and the United States.
The survey questionnaire consists of three main sections covering: risk perceptions
and the social and economic challenges facing respondents and their families; satisfaction
with how well government performs in providing public services and benefits; and desired
policies or preferences for social protection going forward. Most questions are fixedresponse, taking the form of either binary-response or scale-response. The questionnaire
is conducted in national languages.

Preferences for social policy

2.2.2. General social context indicators
When comparing social status and societal response indicators, it is easy to suggest that
one country is doing badly relative to others, or that another is spending a lot of money in
a particular area compared with others. It is important to put such statements into a
broader context. General context indicators including household income, fertility, migration,
family and the demographic trends, provide the general background for other indicators in
this report (see Chapter 4).

2.2.3. Self-sufficiency indicators
Self-sufficiency is an underlying social policy objective. Self-sufficiency is promoted by
ensuring active social and economic participation by people, and their autonomy in
activities of daily life. A selection of indicators is shown in Chapter 5.
For many people, paid employment provides income, identity and social interaction.
Social security systems are also funded by taxes levied on those in paid employment. Thus
promoting higher paid employment is a priority for all OECD countries. To be unemployed
means that supporting oneself and one’s family is not always possible. Skills also play a
central role in ensuring people find and keep employment, particularly important for
young people. A major societal response to enable people to become self-sufficient is
public and private spending in education. The number of expected years in retirement is a
societal response, determined by employment options for older people, age of pension
eligibility, and self-sufficiency in old age.
The table below lists the chosen indicators for assessing whether OECD countries have
been successful in meeting goals for assuring the self-sufficiency of people and their
families.

2.2.4. Equity indicators
Equity is another common social policy objective. Equitable outcomes are measured
mainly in terms of access by people to resources.
Equity has many dimensions (Chapter 6). It includes the ability to access social
services and economic opportunities, as well as equity in outcomes. Opinions vary as to
what exactly entails a fair distribution of opportunities or outcomes. Additionally, as it is
hard to obtain information on all equity dimensions, the social status equity indicators
presented here are limited to inequality in financial resources.
Income inequality is a natural starting point for considering equity across the whole of
society. Often however, policy concerns are more strongly focussed on those at the bottom
end of the income distribution. Hence the use of poverty measures, in addition to overall
inequality. Consideration of guaranteed minimum income benefits shows financial
support and obtainable living standard for low-income families. In periods with high
unemployment, cash transfers for working-age people are a major income safety net. The
indicator of out-of-work benefits complements the more general measures of income

inequality and poverty. All OECD countries have social protection systems that redistribute
resources and insure people against various contingencies. These interventions are
summarised by public social spending. Equity indicators are clearly related to selfsufficiency indicators. Taken together, they reveal how national social protection systems
address the challenge of balancing adequate provision with system sustainability and
promotion of citizens’ self-sufficiency. Having access to quality affordable housing is also
important to reduce poverty risks, improve equality of opportunity and make growth
inclusive and sustainable.

2.2.5. Health indicators
Health status is a fundamental objective of health care systems, but improving health
status also requires a wider focus on its social determinants, making health a central
objective of social policy (Chapter 7).
The links between social and health conditions are well-established. Indeed,
educational gains, public health measures, better access to health care and continuing
progress in medical technology, have contributed to significant improvements in health
status, as measured by life expectancy. Despite effective public health measures, significant
HIV/AIDS transmission continues and remains a major public health issue. Suicide rates give
additional information about health and societal challenges, since there are a complex set
of reasons why some people commit suicide. Health spending is a more general and key part
of the policy response of health care systems to concerns about health conditions. Another
health indicator for total population and youth is Tobacco and alcohol consumption, both
associated with numerous harmful health and social consequences.
Nevertheless, health problems can sometimes have origins in interrelated social
conditions – such as unemployment, poverty, and inadequate housing – beyond the reach
of health policies. Moreover, more than spending levels per se, the effectiveness of health
interventions often depends on other characteristics of the health care system, such as low
coverage of medical insurance or co-payments, which may act as barriers to seeking
medical help. A much broader range of indicators on health conditions and interventions
is provided in OECD Heath Statistics and in Health at a Glance.

2.2.6. Social cohesion indicators
Social cohesion is often identified as an over-arching objective of countries’ social
policies. While little agreement exists on what it means, a range of symptoms are
informative about lack of social cohesion. Social cohesion is positively evident in the extent
to which people participate in their communities or feel safe (Chapter 8).
Life satisfaction is determined not only by economic development, but also by diverse
experiences and living conditions. Confidence in institutions and participation in voting are
two important measures on how well people trust their country’s institutions and
participate in society. A measure of Violence against Women, encompassing all forms of
violence perpetrated against women because they are women, is added to highlight the
persistently high prevalence of such violence. Online activities is another important element
of social cohesion indicator, through online connectedness or adolescent cyberbullying.
It is difficult to identify directly relevant and comparable response indicators at a
country level on social cohesion issues. Policies that are relevant to other dimensions of
social policy (self-sufficiency, equity and health) may also influence social cohesion.

2.3. What can be found in this publication
In each of the domains covered in Chapters 3 to 8 of this report, the chosen indicators
provide each a page of text and a page of charts. Both charts and text generally follow a
standardised pattern. The choice of the time period over which change is considered is
partly determined by data constraints. However, ideally changes are examined: 1) over the
last generation, to compare how society is evolving in the longer term; or 2) over the period
since the last economic crisis (typically between 2007-08), so the extent to which recent
economic fluctuations are influencing social indicators can be studied.
Finally, a box on “Definition and measurement” provides the definitions of data used
and a discussion of potential measurement issues.
The data underlying each indicator are available on the OECD website (http://oe.cd/sag),
or by typing or clicking for “electronic books” on the “StatLink” at bottom right of each
indicator (where data for more countries are also available).

3. PERCEPTIONS OF SOCIAL RISKS AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS

Social and economic risk perceptions and concerns
What are people’s top concerns in OECD countries? The
OECD’s Risks That Matter survey provides key insights into
people’s perceptions of the social and economic risks they
face, both in the short-term (over the next year or two) and
long-term (beyond the next decade).
Around the world, people worry in the short-term about
falling ill and making ends meet. On average across the
21 countries surveyed, slightly over half of respondents list
“becoming ill or disabled” as one of the top-three social or
economic risks facing them or their immediate family in
the next year or two (Figure 3.1). This is the most common
concern in 14 of the 21 countries, including some countries
with highly developed social protection systems, such as
Belgium, Finland and France (OECD, 2019).
Understandably, worries about becoming ill or disabled
grow with age. This is most often a top short-term
concern for older respondents. Younger people, on the
other hand, are frequently worried about securing
affordable housing (ibid).
The second most important (short-term) worry in many
countries is poverty, with 40-50% of all respondents
fearing a struggle to meet daily expenses despite working
in the short term. This answer was especially common
among those with lower incomes and in countries that
were hit hardest by the global financial crisis. Rates were
highest in Greece (70.5%), Italy (55.9%), and Mexico (60%). In
some countries, especially Mexico, personal security is also
a major concern (ibid).
In the longer term, people are most worried about
pensions and finances in old age. On average across
countries, about 72% of all respondents list old-age finances
as one of the top-three long-term concerns facing them or
their family, with the rate rising above 80% in Estonia,
Lithuania and Slovenia (Figure 3.2). Again, unsurprisingly,
older respondents are most likely to pick finances in old age
as one of their greatest worries, but many younger people
are also concerned about their pensions.
Intergenerational mobility is a key issue for many. On
average across the surveyed countries, 60% of parents (those
with a child of their own living in the same household) list
the risk that their children will not achieve the level of status
and comfort that they have themselves as one of their top

66

three long-term concerns. This is the second most common
concern for parents, after their own financial security in old
age (73%) (OECD, 2019). Reflecting the difficulties many young
people face in today’s labour market, younger respondents
are more likely than others to have strong concerns about
their future prospects. On average across the 21 surveyed
countries, well over half of 18- to 29-year-old respondents list
attaining the level of status and comfort their parents had as
one of their top-three long-term concerns (ibid).

Definition and measurement
Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2 present results from the
OECD’s 2018 Risks That Matter survey (see Chapter 2
for more information about the survey). To understand
people’s short- and long-term concerns, respondents
were asked to identify the three greatest risks to
themselves or their immediate family from a list of
seven risks: becoming ill or disabled, losing a job,
affording adequate housing, struggling to meet all
expenses, accessing childcare or education, accessing
long-term care, crime or violence, or none of the
aforementioned choices. Respondents had the option
of selecting zero, one, two, or three risks.
Short-term was defined as “in the next year or two”;
long-term was defined as “beyond the next decade”.
The survey is implemented online using samples
recruited via the internet and over the phone. Sampling
is based on a modified form of quota sampling with
sex, age group, education level, income level, and
worker status used as the sampling criteria. Survey
weights are used to correct for any under- or overrepresentation based on these five criteria. The target
and weighted sample is 1 000 respondents per country.

3. PERCEPTIONS OF SOCIAL RISKS AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS

Perceptions of government effectiveness and fairness
OECD countries have some of the most comprehensive
social protection systems in the world. They spend, on
average, more than 20% of GDP on social policies delivering
public health, housing and family services, old-age supports
like public pensions, and income supports for people in
need. Research on redistribution and poverty suggests that,
in many cases, these social policies are effective. Yet, the
Risks that Matter survey reveals widespread dissatisfaction
with public policies: public programmes are not reaching all
groups effectively and policies do not always correspond to
needs and expectations.
On average, only about one in five people think that they
could easily receive public benefits if they needed them,
with well over 50% disagreeing that access would be easy
across the 21 countries surveyed (Figure 3.3). People are
most confident in their ability to access public benefits in
Canada (34% agree or strongly agree that they could easily
access public benefits if needed), the Netherlands (38%),
and Norway (35%).
Most people do not feel that they receive a fair share of
public benefits, given the taxes and social contributions
they pay. With the exception of Denmark and Norway, the
most common response in all countries was “disagree” or
“strongly disagree” (59% on average) with the statement
“I feel that I receive a fair share of public benefits, given the
taxes and social contributions I pay” (Figure 3.4). In Chile,
Greece, Israel and Mexico, three-quarters or more of the
population disagree that they get their fair share given the
taxes they pay (OECD 2019).
Simultaneously, there is a strong sense that others are
taking more than they should. On average across the
21 countries, two-thirds of respondents (strongly) agree
with the statement “Many people receive public benefits
without deserving them” (ibid).
Underlying this sense of injustice is a commonly-held
belief that government is not working for, or listening to,
the people. In all but four of the surveyed countries (Canada,
Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands), a majority of
respondents to the Risks That Matter survey disagree with the
statement “I feel the government incorporates the views of
people like me when designing or reforming public benefits”
(Figure 3.5). In countries like France, Greece, Israel,
Lithuania, Portugal and Slovenia, this share rises as high as
70% or more (Figure 3.5). These feelings spread across most
social groups, and are not limited just those deemed “left
behind”. Notably, despite the common perception that

68

young people are among the most disillusioned with
government, respondents aged 18-29 are much less likely
than others to feel that their voice is being ignored in the
policy debate (ibid).
D e s p i t e a w i d e s p re a d s e n s e o f i n j u s t i c e a n d
disillusionment, people continue to express compassion
and support for pro-poor redistributive policies. When
asked to explain why people live in poverty, the most
common answer in 17 of the 21 surveyed countries was
“injustice in society”: 71% of Portuguese and 68% of Mexicans
pointed to injustice as the root cause of poverty, as did more
than two-thirds of French, German and Slovenian
respondents (OECD, 2019). At the same time, in every country
surveyed, more than half of respondents say that the
government should tax the rich more than they currently do
in order to support the poor. In Greece, Germany, Portugal
and Slovenia, the share rises to 75% or more (ibid).

Definition and measurement
Figure 3.3, Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5 present results
from the OECD’s 2018 Risks that Matter survey (see
Chapter 2 for more information about the survey). In
Figure 3.3, respondents were asked to indicate the
degree to which they agreed or disagreed with the
statement “I think I could easily receive public benefits
if I needed them”. For Figure 3.4, respondents were
asked to indicate the degree to which they agreed or
disagreed with the statement “I feel that I receive a fair
share of public benefits, given the taxes and social
contributions I pay”. For Figure 3.5, respondents were
asked to indicate the degree to which they agreed or
disagreed with the statement “I feel the government
incorporates the views of people like me when
designing or reforming public benefits”.
Possible response options for all three questions were
“strongly disagree”, “disagree”, “undecided”, “agree”
and “strongly agree”.

3. PERCEPTIONS OF SOCIAL RISKS AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS

Preferences for social policy
Unsurprisingly, given levels of dissatisfaction with
government services, most people say they want more
support from their government. Across all but two
countries, a majority of respondents say they would like
the government to do more to ensure their economic and
social security, as opposed to the same or less (Figure 3.6).
Even in Denmark and France – where people are most
satisfied with social policies – more than 45% of
respondents believe that government should do more. In
Chile, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Mexico, Portugal, and
Slovenia, this share rises to 80% or more.
Priorities for specific supports differ and vary across social
groups, but increased investment in pensions and health care
are often top priorities. On average across the 21 surveyed
countries, 54% of respondents pick a better pension and 48%
list improved health care as one of the three top supports they
would “need most from the government” to make them and their
family feel more economically secure (OECD, 2019).
People are willing to pay for better pensions and health
care. In 19 of the 21 surveyed countries, respondents are
more likely to agree than disagree that government should
increase spending on pensions, even if it means taxes will
rise and some other programmes need to be cut, and an
average of almost 40% say they would be willing to pay an
extra 2% of their own income in taxes for better health care
and pensions (Figure 3.7). Respondents in Ireland are the
most likely to say they would pay more in taxes for better
health care (51% say this), followed by Portugal (49%),
Greece and Chile (both 48%).
There is less support for expansion in other policy areas, but
nevertheless, roughly one-quarter of respondents say they
would be willing to pay more in taxes for better housing,
education and long-term care services (OECD, 2019).
Across countries, respondents in less wealthy countries are
more likely than others to prioritise labour market
supports, like job-seeking services or funds to start a
business. Respondents in richer countries more often say
better housing supports are one of the things they need
most from government (ibid).
People in countries with relatively high levels of income
inequality are more likely to prioritise education supports
than people in more egalitarian countries (Figure 3.8),
perhaps to help ensure equality of opportunity. In highly

70

unequal countries like Greece and Chile, for example, more
than four in ten respondents list education as one of their
most-needed policies – and a similar share endorse paying
more in taxes to get it.

Definition and measurement
The following figures present results from the 2018
OECD Risks that Matter survey (see Chapter 2 for more
information about the survey). For Figure 3.6,
respondents were asked whether they thought the
government should be doing less, more, or the same
as they are currently doing to ensure their economic
and social security. They could also choose “don’t
know” as a response option.
For Figure 3.7, respondents were asked to indicate
whether they would be willing to pay an additional
2% of their income in taxes/social contributions to
benefit from better provision of and access to the
various different public services and benefits. They
could chose as many as they liked, or none at all.
For Figure 3.8, Panel A, respondents were asked what
supports they would need most from government to
make them and their feel more economically secure.
They could choose from a list of nine supports, and had
the option of selecting zero, one, two, or three supports.
In Panel B: respondents were asked to indicate whether
they would be willing to pay an additional 2% of their
income in taxes/social contributions to benefit from
better provision of and access to the various different
public services and benefits. They could chose as many
as they liked, or none at all. Data on the Gini coefficient
refer to 2015, except for Mexico (2014), income are based
on disposable income (after taxes and transfers) from
the OECD Income Distribution database.

4. GENERAL CONTEXT INDICATORS

Household income
Disposable household income provides an indication of the
goods and services families can purchase on the market. It
is thus an objective indication of material quality of life,
and it is used to measure poverty and inequality.
Converting national currencies into US dollars using the
purchasing power parity allows for a meaningful
comparison across countries.
In 2016, the median disposable household income in
Luxembourg was eight times higher than in Mexico and
about two times higher than in Spain (Figure 4.1).
Countries with low levels of median household income
include Chile, Mexico, Turkey and many Eastern and
Southern European countries. Luxembourg, Norway and
Switzerland are the top-3 countries with the highest
median disposable household income. Median incomes are
generally lower in emerging economies than in OECD
countries.
In most OECD countries for which long-term data are
available, median income has been growing faster than
income at the bottom of the distribution and slower than
at the top since the 1980s (Figure 4.2). Income growth has
been considerably slower across the distribution since the
2008 global financial crisis than in previous decades,
despite the redistributive effect of public cash transfers and
personal income taxes during this period. These general
trends hide strong differences across countries. For
instance, as a result of the financial crisis, median income
in Greece was still 10% lower in 2016 than in 1985. By
contrast during the same period, median income increased
significantly in Israel, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and
the United Kingdom.
The middle class plays an essential role for the economy as
well as for social and political stability. On average 61% of
the population across the OECD lives in the middleincome class, defined here as households earning
between 75% and two times the median national income
(Figure 4.3). This share ranges from around half in Chile,
Israel, Mexico and the United States to around 70% in
Nordic and some Continental European countries. On
average across the OECD, the lower income group makes up
to 30% of the population and the upper income group
accounts for 9% of the population. In emerging economies
except the Russian Federation, the upper income group
accounts for 20-25% of the population.

Definition and measurement
Data on annual median equivalised household
disposable income come from the OECD Income
Distribution Database. Disposable income is market
income (income from work and capital) after taking into
account public cash transfers received and direct taxes
and social security contributions paid. It excludes
in-kind services provided to households by governments
and private entities, consumption taxes, and imputed
income flows due to home ownership. After subtracting
taxes and adding cash transfers, household income
provides an indication of the goods and services
families can purchase on the market. Household
income is adjusted for differences in the needs of
households of different sizes with an equivalence scale
that divides household income by the square root of
household size. The adjusted income is then attributed
to every person in the household.
For cross-country comparison, national currency
measures of income were converted into US dollars
(USD) using purchasing power parity (PPP) for private
consumption exchange rates. These PPPs reflect the
amount of a national currency required in each
country to buy the same basket of goods and services
as a dollar does in the United States. Both income and
PPP estimates are affected by statistical errors, so
differences between countries of 5% or less are not
considered significant.
Middle class is defined here as households with
incomes between 75% and two times the national
median income.

Fertility
The total fertility rate indicates the number of children an
average woman would have if she were to experience the
exact age-specific fertility throughout her life. Allowing for
some mortality during infancy and childhood, the population
is replaced at a total fertility rate of a little over two.
Over the last decades, fertility declined dramatically
a c ro s s O E C D c o u n t r i e s , f a l l i n g o n ave ra g e f ro m
2.8 children per woman of childbearing age in 1970 to
1.7 in 2016 (Figure 4.4). The decline was particularly
pronounced – by at least three children per woman on
average – in Korea, Mexico and Turkey. There was a
moderate recovery in average fertility rates between 2000
and 2008, but this rebound stalled in many OECD countries
in 2009, probably as a consequence of the crisis.
In 2016, fertility was well below the replacement level in
most countries, averaging 1.7 across the OECD (Figure 4.4)
and still below the pre-crisis level. The highest rate was
recorded in Israel at 3.1, where women had on average one
child more than women in Mexico and Turkey, the
countries with the second and third highest rates,
respectively. These three countries were the only OECD
countries with a level above the replacement fertility rate
(2.1 children per woman). Ireland and France have the
highest fertility rate in Europe (and the fourth and fifth
highest rates in the OECD), but also Anglophone and Nordic
countries were typically at the higher end. The lowest
fertility rates are found in South Europe, Japan and Korea,
with on average just one child per women in the latter.
Fertility rates are generally higher in key partner
economies than in OECD countries; rates are above
replacement levels in Argentina, India, Indonesia, Saudi
Arabia and South Africa. With the exception of the Russian
Federation, fertility decreased in all key partner economies
between 1995 and 2016.
Rising female education and employment, a delayed entry in
the labour market, growing housing problems and in some
cases insufficient support for families juggling work and
children, have all played a role in declining fertility. The
postponement of family formation is reflected age-specific
fertility trends. Since 2000, fertility rates have been declining
for women under 30 years old whereas they been rising for
those aged 30 years and older (Figure 4.5). In the last few
years, the average OECD fertility rate of 30-34s exceeded the
fertility rate of 25-29s, and so did the rate of 35-39s compared
to 20-24s. The average 40-44s fertility rate is about to surpass
the adolescent fertility rate, as it already does in two-thirds of
OECD countries. The adolescent fertility rate has fallen to low
levels at under three births per 1 000 adolescents in Korea, the
Netherlands and Switzerland, but it remains high at above 60
in Mexico.
The postponement of family formation is also reflected in
the increase in the mean age of women at first childbirth,

76

in all 30 OECD countries for which data are available
(Figure 4.6). Between 1995 and 2016, the mean age at first
birth has risen by almost three years on average in the
OECD, from 26.0 to 28.9 years old. In 2016, mean ages at
first birth were lowest at around 27 years in the United
States and some Eastern European countries (Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovak Republic), whereas
they were above 30 years in Japan, Korea, Ireland,
Luxembourg, Switzerland, Greece, Italy and Spain.

Definition and measurement
The total fertility rate is the expected number of
children born to each woman at the end of the
childbearing years (i.e. if the likelihood of her giving
birth to children at each age was the current prevailing
age specific fertility rates). It is computed by summing
up the age-specific fertility rates defined over five year
intervals. Assuming there is no net migration and
mortality remains unchanged, the total fertility rate of
2.1 children per woman ensures broad population
stability (“replacement rate”).
The age-specific fertility rates are the number of births
per 1 000 women of a given age in a given year. They
are presented here per five-year age group.
Fertility data typically come from civil population
registers or other administrative records. The data are
harmonised according to United Nations and Eurostat
recommendations.
Mean ages of women at first birth are from the OECD
Family Database, based on Eurostat demographic
statistics and United Nations World Fertility Data 2017.

4. GENERAL CONTEXT INDICATORS

Migration
Annual new permanent migration flows represent less than
1% of the population in nearly all OECD countries (Figure 4.7).
Only Switzerland and Luxembourg have, since many years,
much higher rates, reaching 1.5% and 3.4% respectively in
2016. Permanent migration flows rose sharply in Germany
and Sweden in recent years, giving both countries a spot in
the top five OECD countries in terms of immigration as a
proportion of the population. Within the EU, many
permanent migrants come from other EU countries through
the free mobility arrangements. The share of migrants
coming from third countries to EU countries remains
relatively low but has been rising from 0.22% in the period
2010-15 to 0.36% in 2016.
Across OECD countries, permanent migration flows
increased by 15% in 2016. Two-thirds of the increase is due to
increased humanitarian migration, particularly to Germany,
and one-fourth is due to rising family migration, in particular
to the United States. For other OECD countries, there were
few changes in the numbers of new labour migrants or in the
magnitude of migration movements within free-circulation
areas. Preliminary figures for 2017 show a slight decrease in
flows, the first decline recorded since 2011.
On average in the OECD, more than 10% of the population
was foreign-born in 2017 (Figure 4.8). The share of foreignborn within the population was highest in Australia,
Canada, Israel, Luxembourg, New Zealand and Switzerland,
where at least one-in-five people were foreign-born. Nearly
two-thirds of the OECD countries had an immigrant
population exceeding one in ten of the population. Around
two-thirds of the foreign-born are from non-EU countries.
Over one-third of immigrants in the OECD live in the United
States, where they make up almost 14% of the population.
Luxembourg is the country with the highest share of
foreign-born – over 46% of its population. With the exception
of Israel and the Baltic States, the share of foreign-born in
the total population increased in all OECD countries over the
last decade. Over two-thirds of immigrants in the OECD have
lived in their host country for at least ten years, while 16%
have been residents for up to five years.
In the EU, interaction with immigrants occurs more often
in the neighbourhood than at the workplace, with
respectively 44% and 28% of the native-born population
reporting an interaction with immigrants from non EU
countries at least once a week (Figure 4.9). Countries where
the native-born interact most with the non-EU-born in
their neighbourhood are Southern European countries,
Ireland and Austria. Interaction with immigrant colleagues
is most common in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.
For more information about immigrant civic engagement
and social integration, see Chapter 5 in OECD/EU (2018),
Settling In 2018: Indicators of Immigrant Integration.

Definition and measurement
Permanent movements refer to entries for long-term
residents either for labour, family, humanitarian or
free mobility reasons and include only foreign
nationals. These inflows include status changes,
namely persons in the country on a temporary status
who obtained the right to stay on a longer-term basis.
This standardised definition has been designed, when
data were available, to make the scale and composition
of migration most comparable across countries.
Immigrants are, in the first instance, defined as those
who are foreign-born, whatever their citizenship at
birth. In general, the foreign-born population is
substantially larger than the share of foreign nationals.
Immigrants offspring include different categories of
people: i.e. they can either be born in their parents’
host country to two foreign-born parents; or to mixed
parentage (one foreign-born parent); be foreign-born
and arrived as children; or be foreign-born and arrived
as adults.
The indicator on interactions, which is only available
for EU countries, seeks to assess the frequency of
interactions of the natives with immigrants born in a
third country (“On average, how often do you interact
with immigrants? Interaction can mean anything from
exchanging a few words to doing an activity together”).
Two types of interaction are considered in this section:
in the workplace and in the neighbourhood.
Interactions are considered frequent when they occur
at least once a week; rare when they occur once a year
or less frequently. Data cover the native-born aged 15
and older.

4. GENERAL CONTEXT INDICATORS

Family
The living arrangements of children are important as they
can influence their welfare and poverty rates. Across OECD
countries, most children live in households with two
parents (Figure 4.10). Rates vary across counties, from less
than 70% in Latvia and the United States to as high as 90%
in Turkey and Greece. Most remaining children live with a
single parent, rather than without parents. With 28%,
Latvia has the highest proportion of children living with a
single parent. Rates are also high in Belgium, Lithuania, the
United Kingdom and the United States, where around one
in four children live with a single parent.
Among children living with two parents, the majority has
married parents rather than cohabiting parents. In Greece,
Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Slovak Republic,
Spain, Switzerland and the United States, less than 10% of
all children live with cohabiting parents. In Estonia, Iceland,
Slovenia and Sweden, more than 25% of all children live with
cohabiting parents. However, even in these countries, the
most common arrangement by far is still “living with two
married parents”. Over the last decade, the share of children
living with cohabiting couples has been increasing in most
countries (OECD, 2018).
Across the OECD, the average age at which people get
married has significantly increased (Figure 4.11). At the
start of the 1990s, the average age at first marriage across
OECD countries was 25 for women and 27 for men. By 2016,
this average age has increased to 30 for women and to 32 for
men. Despite common declining trends in increasing ages at
first marriage, there remain notable differences between
countries. The average age is very high in the Nordic
countries. In Israel and Turkey, by contrast, the average age
at first marriage is around 25 for women and less than 28 for
men. The difference between countries points to a variety of
transition paths towards the formation of long-term
partnerships: cohabitation has become an important form
of long-term partnership in, for example, the Nordic
countries, where people are postponing and frequently
replacing marriage as the partnership standard.
Higher ages of marriage are accompanied by declining
marriage rates and stabilising divorce rates. In 2016, crude
marriage rates were between 3.5 and 7 marriages per 1 000,
with the OECD average standing at 4.8 (Figure 4.12). Rates
are very low in Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Slovenia at
3.5 or fewer marriages per 1 000 people, while rates are at
least twice as high in Lithuania, Turkey and the United
States. Marriage rates are even higher in the Russian
Federation (8.5 per 1 000) and China (9.6 per 1 000). In
contrast, in 1990, most OECD countries had a marriage rate
of five to eight marriages per 1 000 people. Only Sweden
and Turkey experienced an increase in marriage rates
between 1990 and 2016. Crude divorce rates also vary
across countries, from as low as 0.1 divorces per 1 000
people in Chile to above 3 per 1 000 in Latvia, Lithuania and
the United States in 2016. Between 1990 and 2014, the
picture was mixed: the rates increased in 20 OECD
countries but decreased in 16 others. Decline was most
pronounced in the United States, from 4.8 divorces per
1 000 in 1992 to 3.2 in 2016, while increase was highest in
Spain, from 0.6 divorces per 1 000 in 1990 to 2.1 in 2016.

80

In January 2019, marriage among persons of same sex
was legalised in 20 OECD countries (Figure 1.8). Data on
same-sex marriages/divorces are not yet available across
all those countries. In France in 2018, 3% of weddings were
among persons of same sex, being equally shared among
female and male same-sex couples (INSEE, 2019).

Definition and measurement
The distribution of children (aged 0-17) is categorised
according to the presence and marital status of
parents in the household, as follows:
• Living with two parents, where the child lives primarily in a household with two adults that are
reported as “parents” of the child. For European
countries and a few non-European OECD countries,
data allow for further disaggregation between those
that live with two married parents and those that
live with two cohabiting parents. For European
countries, “married parents” in principle includes
parents in registered partnerships, although actual
practice may vary from country to country.
• Living with a single parent, where the child lives
primarily in a household with only one adult that is
reported as a “parent”.
• Other, where the child lives primarily in a household where no adult is considered a parent.
The mean age at first marriage is defined as the mean
average age in years of marrying persons at the time
of first marriage. This measure is disaggregated by
sex with separate averages for men and women.
The crude marriage rate is defined as the number of legal
civil unions or marriages each year per 1 000 people. The
crude divorce rate, defined as the number of marriages
that are dissolved each year per 1 000 people.

4. GENERAL CONTEXT INDICATORS

Demographic trends
Age-dependency ratios are a measure of the age structure of
the population. They provide information about the
demographic shifts that have characterised OECD countries
in the past and that are expected in the future.
OECD populations became older and will continue to
become older in the coming decades. In 2015, on average
across OECD countries, there were 28 persons aged 65 and
over for every 100 persons aged 20 to 64; up from 18 in 1970
(Figure 4.13). Cross-country differences are large, varying
from less than 15% in Mexico and Turkey, to over 35% in
Finland, Italy, Greece and Portugal and to over 45% in Japan.
By 2060, the average ratio is projected to double in the OECD
area (to 57%) and to quadruple in Korea. By 2060, the old-age
dependency ratio will almost reach 80% in Korea and Japan
while remaining below 45% in Israel, Mexico, Turkey and the
United States. This increase will contribute to higher public
spending in health, long-term care and pensions.
Conversely, the youth-dependency ratio declined
between 1970 and 2015. In 2015, there were 38 persons
aged below 20 for every 100 persons aged 20 to 64 on
average across OECD countries, down from 70% in 1970
(Figure 4.14). In 2015, the youth-dependency ratio ranged
between 30% in Germany and Korea and 65% or more in
Israel and Mexico. In most OECD countries, this ratio will
stop declining, reaching an average level of 39% in 2060,
except in Chile, Israel, Mexico and Turkey. Lower youth
dependency means lower public spending in education and
towards families. But overall, the declines are not large
enough to offset higher spending towards the elderly.
In emerging economies, old-age dependency ratios are in
general lower than in OECD countries, particularly in
India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. By
contrast, youth dependency ratios are higher.
Figure 4.15 also presents the past, current and future
shares of youth aged 15 to 29 – those in age to enter the
labour market – as a percentage of the total population. On
average, the share declined from 22% in 1970 to 19% in
2015, with strongest declines in the “ageing” countries
Japan, Finland, Italy and Spain. The average ratio is

82

forecasted to decline even further to 16% of the total
population by 2060, with the strongest declines in
countries that will become considerably older in the next
decades, like Chile, Mexico, Korea and Turkey.

Definition and measurement
Age-dependency ratios relate the number of individuals
who are likely to be “dependent” on the support of
others for their daily living – elderly or youths – to the
number of those individuals who are capable of
providing such support.
The old-age dependency ratio measures the number
of individuals aged 65 and over as a percentage of the
population aged 20 to 64. The youth dependency
relates the number of individuals aged less than 20 to
the population aged 20 to 64. An additional ratio is
shown here: the share of youth aged 15-29 as a
percentage of the total population.
Estimates prior to 2015 and projections for 2060 are
drawn from the United Nations, World Population
Prospects – 2017 Revision. Projections used here are
based on the most recent “medium fertility variant”
population projections, which for each country
corresponds to the median of several thousand
projected trajectories of each demographic component.

5. SELF-SUFFICIENCY INDICATORS

Employment
Employment is a key factor in self-sufficiency. On average,
seven-out-of-ten working-age adults in the OECD area are
employed (Figure 5.1). In Iceland and Switzerland, more
than eight out of ten are employed, compared with five out
of ten in Greece and Turkey. Employment levels are generally
above OECD average in Nordic and Anglophone countries,
and they are below OECD average in Mediterranean, South
American and non-Member countries, except in China.
In every country, men are more likely in paid employment
than women. The gender employment gap is smallest
(under 5 percentage points) in several European Nordic
countries, Latvia and Lithuania. The gap is largest in Mexico
and Turkey (over 30 percentage points) and still relatively
high in Chile and Korea (around 20 percentage points).
Labour market conditions generally continue to improve
after the strong impact of the global economic crisis of
2008-09. In 2017, the OECD average employment rate was
almost 2 percentage points above its pre-crisis level in 2007.
Employment levels increased particularly in Hungary and
Poland (around 10 percentage points within 10 years), but
they are still below pre-crisis levels in countries strongly hit
by the crisis (Greece, Ireland and Spain).
The incidence of non-standard forms of employment is not
a marginal issue. In 2017, 16% of all workers were selfemployed across the OECD on average, and a further 13% of
all dependent employees had a temporary employment
contract (Figure 5.2). Self-employment is the most prevalent
form of non-standard work in Greece and Turkey. Temporary
employment also represents more than 25% of dependent
employment in Chile, Poland and Spain. Non-standard work
can be a “stepping stone” to more stable employment, but
many non-standard workers are worse off in many aspects
of job quality, such as earnings, job security, social
protection or access to training.
Digitalisation is reducing demand for routine and manual
tasks while increasing demand for low- and high-skilled
tasks and for problem-solving and interpersonal skills.
Recent results from the OECD’s Survey of Adult Skills
(PIAAC) reveal that 14% of jobs have a high risk of
automation on average in the OECD (Figure 5.3). Risks vary
across countries, ranging from 34% in Slovak Republic
Slovak to 6% in Norway. A further 32% of jobs have a low risk
of complete automation but an important share of
automatable tasks. These jobs will not be substituted
entirely, but a large share of their tasks may, radically
transforming how these jobs are carried out.

Definition and measurement (cont.)
definition during a survey reference week. The basic
indicator for employment is the proportion of the
population aged 15-64 who are employed.
Temporary employees are wage and salary workers
whose job has a pre-determined termination date as
opposed to permanent employees whose job is of
unlimited duration. To be included in the group of
temporary employees are: i) persons with a seasonal
job; ii) persons engaged by an employment agency or
business and hired out to a third party for carrying out a
“work mission”; and iii) persons with specific training
contracts (including apprentices, trainees, research
assistants, probationary period of a contract, etc.).
Self-employment jobs are those jobs where the
remuneration is directly dependent upon the profits
(or the potential for profits) derived from the goods or
services produced (where own consumption is
considered to be part of the profits). Self-employment
jobs include employers, own-account workers,
members of producer cooperatives and contributing
family workers.
National definitions broadly conform to this generic
definition, but may vary depending on national
circumstances. For more information, see www.oecd.org/
employment/database.
Jobs are at high risk of automation if the likelihood of
their job being automated is at least 70%. Jobs at risk of
significant change are those with the likelihood of
their job being automated estimated at 50-70%.

Unemployment
In addition to putting a strain on household and public
finances, unemployment can have a demoralising effect on
individuals and diminish their career prospects. The great
recession of 2008-09 led to record unemployment rates
across the OECD. Even if unemployment rates are below (or
close to) pre-crisis levels in many countries, still on average
7% of the active working-age population was unemployed
in 2017 across the OECD (Figure 5.4).
Countries present a diverse picture. The Czech Republic,
Iceland and Japan exhibit rates as low as 3%, while many
countries including the United States, the United Kingdom
and Germany, cluster around 4%. On the other hand,
unemployment is still strikingly high in the Southern
European countries hit hardest by the crisis, such as Greece
(22%), Spain (17%) and Portugal and Italy (11%) as well as in
Brazil (13%) and South Africa (27%). Some countries have seen
impressive falls in unemployment in the last decade,
particularly Germany and Israel, where the unemployment
rate more than halved. The fall has also been also substantial
in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Indonesia.
Gender unemployment gap is low (under 3 percentage
points difference) in most countries, but women are more
likely to be on unemployment than men (above 3 percentage
points difference) in Greece, Spain and Turkey and in key
partner countries Brazil, Costa Rica and South Africa.
Unemployment as well as inactivity also hits the young
people. The share of 15-29-year olds who were neither
employed, nor in education or training in 2017 reached
13.4% on average across OECD countries (Figure 5.5).
A breakdown of NEETs into those actively seeking a job
(unemployed NEETs) and those who are not (inactive NEETs)
shows that in most countries the majority of NEETs are not
looking for work. Lower skills make young people
particularly vulnerable to unemployment and inactivity, as
young people with no more than lower-secondary education
are three times more likely to be NEET than those with a
university-level degree.
A broader measure of labour market slack is the so-called
broad labour underutilisation, which enables to quantify the
degree to which available labour resources are either not
utilised (i.e. joblessness) or underutilised such as people who
wish to and are available to work more hours than they
usually do and are working part-time (i.e. underemployment).
On average across OECD countries, more than one in four
persons (26%) of working-age is “underutilised” (Figure 5.6).
The share is lowest in Iceland at 12% and is highest in Greece,
Italy and Turkey at above 40%. Compared to 2007, 2017 rates
are 4% points higher in Ireland and Italy, 7% points higher in
Spain and as much as 11% points in Greece in 2017. On the
other hand, rates particularly decreased during the same
period in the Czech Republic (-6%), Poland (-7%), Germany and
Turkey (-8%) and Hungary and Israel (-10%).

88

Definition and measurement
The unemployment rate is the ratio of people not
working, actively seeking and available to take a job to
the population of working age either in work or
unemployed (aged 15 to 64). The data are gathered
through labour force surveys of member countries.
According to the standardised ILO definition used in
these surveys, the unemployed are those who did not
work for at least one hour in the reference week of the
survey, but who are currently available for work and
who have taken specific steps to seek employment in
the four weeks including the survey reference week.
Thus, for example, people who cannot work because of
physical impairment, or who are not actively seeking a
job because they have little hope of finding work are
not considered as unemployed. The unemployment
rates are also presented by gender.
The so-called NEET population refers to youth
population (aged 15 to 29) who is neither in employment
nor in education or training. NEET rates are presented
here by status of joblessness: unemployed or inactive.
Data refer to OECD estimates based on national labour
force surveys.
Broad labour underutilisation is a broader measure of
joblessness and underemployment adding up inactive
and unemployed people as well as involuntary parttimers aged 15-64 expressed as a share of population
aged 15-64. Youth (15-29) in education and not in
employment are excluded from the numerator and the
denominator.

Skills
Globalisation, technological progress and demographic
changes are having a profound impact on the world of work.
These mega-trends are affecting the number and quality of
jobs that are available, how they are carried out and the
skills that workers will need in the future to succeed in an
increasingly competitive landscape.
On average across the OECD countries analysed by the
Skills for Jobs database, more than five-out-of-ten jobs that
are hard-to-fill (i.e. in shortage) are found in high-skilled
occupations (Figure 5.7). These jobs range from managerial
positions to highly skilled professionals in the health care,
teaching or ICT sectors. A relatively large share of
occupational shortage (approximately 39% of total jobs that
are hard-to-fill across the OECD) is also found in mediumskilled occupations, such as personal service workers or
electrical and electronic trades workers. Fewer than one out
of ten jobs in shortage across the OECD are found, instead, in
low-skilled occupations. The intensity of occupational
shortages, however, varies significantly across countries
both within the OECD and in developing countries. In
Finland, more than nine out of ten jobs in shortage are of the
high-skilled type. In Mexico and Chile, the demand for
highly skilled professionals is significantly lower, with less
than two out of ten jobs in shortage being “high-skilled” and
the majority of jobs in shortage being found, instead, in
medium to low-skilled occupations.
Emerging mega trends are increasingly reshaping the
demand for specific types of skills. On average across OECD
countries and during the period between 2004 and 2014,
the shortage of high-level cognitive skills has increased,
while the demand for physical abilities and routine skills
has decreased relative to the supply (Figure 5.8). For
i n s t a n c e, c o g n i t i v e a b i l i t i e s r e l a t e d t o r e a d i n g ,
understanding and processing information and ideas
(e.g. written comprehension or expression) or others related
to the ability of applying general rules to specific problems
(e.g. deductive reasoning) are among the several cognitive
dimensions for which shortages increased between 2004
and 2014. Physical abilities such as Trunk Strength, Stamina
o r A r m - h a n d s t e a d i n e s s ( t y p i c a l ly u s e d i n m a ny
occupations that are nowadays at risk of being automated by
more precise machines) have seen the sharpest declines in
demand in the last decade.
The misallocation of talent in the labour market leads to
qualification mismatch, i.e. workers are under- or
overqualified for their job. On average across the OECD,
approximately 36% of workers are mismatched by
qualifications with shares of under and over-qualified
workers being roughly the same, 19% and 17% respectively
(Figure 5.9). The prevalence of both types of mismatch
speaks to both an insufficient supply of talent (causing
under-qualification to emerge in some parts of the labour
market) as well as to weak skill demand (commanding the

90

emergence of over-qualification). The magnitude of
qualification mismatch changes substantially from one
country to the other. On the one hand, approximately one in
two workers in Mexico and Chile are mismatched by
qualifications, with large shares of workers being overqualified. On the other hand, less than two in ten workers
are mismatched by qualifications in the Czech Republic and
only 8% of these are over-qualified in their jobs.

Definition and measurement
The OECD Skills for Jobs database (www.oecdskillsforjobs
database.org) defines skills as either hard-to-find (in
shortage) or easy-to-find (in surplus). The indicators
measuring these imbalances in the labour market
(both shortages and surpluses) are constructed
following a two-step approach that delivers two
different, though related, sets of information on:
• Skills shortages and surpluses – measuring the
extent by which each skill dimension is (or not)
hard to find in the labour market.
• Occupational imbalances – measuring the extent by
which jobs in each occupational group are hard or
easy to fill for firms in the current labour market.
The Occupational shortage indicator is a composite
indicator that ranks occupations in shortage or in
surplus within each country based on the analysis of
five sub-components: wage growth, employment
growth, hours worked growth, unemployment rate,
change in under-qualification.
Information on skill requirements in each occupation
are extracted from the O*NET database which provides
categorical data about the skills required to perform
the tasks of more than 800 different occupations.

Education spending
Annual expenditure per student on educational institutions
provides an assessment of the investment made in each
student. On average, OECD countries spent USD 10 400 per
student from primary through tertiary education in 2015
(Figure 5.10). Spending was highest in Luxembourg with
USD 22 400 per child, followed by the United States, Norway
and Austria. On the opposite end, spending was below
USD 5 000 in Mexico and Turkey. Non-Members Brazil and
the Russian Federation had education spending slightly
higher than the low-spending OECD countries at around
USD 5 000. Spending was also relatively low (between
USD 6 000 and 9 000) in several Eastern European countries.
The corresponding share of national income is substantial:
in 2015 OECD countries spent on average 5% of their GDP on
educational institutions from primary to tertiary levels,
ranging from 3.5% in Ireland to 6.4% in Norway.
Between 2010 and 2015, total expenditure on educational
institutions from primary to tertiary levels as a share of
GDP decreased by 4% across OECD countries, mainly due to
slower increase in public expenditure on educational
institutions compared with GDP (Figure 5.11). Spending
decreased in 20 out of 28 countries for which data are
available. Estonia, Ireland (mainly due a revision of its 2015
GDP), Lithuania and Slovenia had the largest negative
change, while the Slovak Republic had the largest positive
change mainly driven by a substantial increase in both
public and private investment in tertiary education. Looking
closer by level of education, average spending remained
rather stable at tertiary level while it decreased at nontertiary levels by a little over 6%.
On average across OECD countries, less investment is put
in early education as compared with later years, ranging
from around USD 8 500 spending per child in early
childhood and primary levels to almost twice as much at the
“Bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral” tertiary level (Figure 5.12).
These averages mask a broad range of variation across
countries. In early childhood education, spending per child
ranges from USD 2 700 in Mexico to almost eight times more
in Luxembourg at USD 20 500. Even so, investment in early
education has been shown to improve equity. Targeting
more resources to early childhood education, and in
p a r t i c u l a r t o d i s a dva n t ag e d ch i l d re n , i s a m a j o r
recommendation of the OECD’s Framework for Policy Action
for Inclusive Growth, and a way to reduce inequalities.
Investing in vocational education is an important way to
smoothen school-to-work transitions, particularly for

92

vulnerable youth. On average, countries spend almost
USD 2 000 per student more on vocational programmes than
on general programmes at upper secondary education. The
gap is larger in countries with large enrolments in dualsystem apprenticeship programmes, such as Austria,
Germany and the Netherlands. At the same time, Australia,
Norway, Slovenia and the United Kingdom spend less per
student on vocational education than on general uppersecondary programmes.

Definition and measurement
Data on education spending per child is calculated
using total annual spending from primary to tertiary
education (including research and development
activities) divided by the corresponding full-time
equivalent enrolment. Figures are for public and private
spending combined, and are reported in US dollars
based on purchasing power parities for GDP from 2015.
The trends in expenditure on educational institutions
in percentage of GDP also refer to the spending
originating in, or generated by, the public and private
sectors.
Levels of education are based on the International
Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011),
which distinguishes six levels of education, classified
here into four groups: early childhood (ISCED-0),
primary (ISCED-1), lower secondary (ISCED-2), upper
secondary (ISCED-3),post-secondary non-tertiary
(ISCED-4), short cycle tertiary (ISCED-5), and Bachelor,

5. SELF-SUFFICIENCY INDICATORS

Expected years in retirement
The indicator of expected years in retirement illustrates the
average years of remaining life expectancy from the age of
labour market exit. The indicator demonstrates how
pension systems interact with labour market exit and
reveals the financial pressures on the pension system in the
context of an ageing population.
Men and women can expect to spend respectively 17.8 and
22.5 years in retirement on average (Figure 5.13). The most
recent calculations of expected years in retirement exceed
20 years for men in Austria, Belgium, France, Greece, Italy,
Luxembourg and Spain (Figure 5.13, Panel A). The duration
exceeds 25 years for women in Austria, Belgium, France,
Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Spain (Figure 5.13,
Panel B). The number of expected years in retirement was
notably low for men in Korea and Mexico – less than 14 years –
and for women in Korea, Mexico and Turkey – under 20 years.
Women can expect to spend, on average, almost five years
longer in retirement than men. In most Eastern European
and South American countries, as well as in Portugal, the
gender gap was at least six years. Longer periods in
retirement expose women to old age poverty, in particularly
in those countries where price indexation of pension
payment magnifies the gender pay gap.
The expected years in retirement for women in emerging
countries varies from 25 years in Costa Rica to 18 years in
South Africa. The variation is less for men, who can expect
13 to 15 years in retirement. While the effective age of labour
force exit in Costa Rica was more than nine years lower for
women than for men, the difference in South Africa was
only one to two years.
The average expected number of years in retirement across
OECD countries has increased over time. In 1970, men in
OECD countries spent, on average, ten years in retirement
and by 2017, this average increased to 18 years (Figure 5.14,
Panel A). The increase in the expected years in retirement
was similar for women; increasing from 14 years on average
in 1970 to 22 years in 2017 (Figure 5.14, Panel B).
The increase in the expected years in retirement from 1970
to 2017 is due to both a drop in the effective exit age from the
labour force and increased longevity. The effective age of
labour force exit decreased gradually from 1970 to the late
1990s for both men and women. After a few relatively stable
years, the average effective exit age started to increase
slowly from the early 2000s. It increased by two years for
both men and women between the mid-2000s and 2017.

94

Life expectancy at the effective exit age from the labour force
increased substantially during this period, particularly for
women, and over the last two decades for men as well. In the
last few years, this increase in life expectancy at the effective
exit age has been fairly equal to that of the effective exit age
from the labour market, and potential years in retirement
have stabilised.

Definition and measurement
Expected years in retirement is a calculation of
remaining life expectancy from the time of effective
age of labour force exit for men and women.
The average effective age of labour force exit is
calculated as a weighted average of (net) withdrawals
from the labour market at different ages over a fiveyear period for workers initially aged 40 and over. In
order to abstract from compositional effects in the age
structure of the population, labour force withdrawals
are estimated based on changes in labour force
participation rates rather than labour force levels.
These changes are calculated for each (synthetic)
cohort divided into five-year age groups. For more
discussion see OECD (2017).
Estimates of the number of years of additional life are
calculated based from the UN World Population
Prospects, the 2017 revision dataset.

6. EQUITY INDICATORS

Inequalities
Inequalities of outcomes such as income and wealth and
inequalities of opportunities go hand in hand, largely because
higher inequality curbs social mobility and opportunities for the
poor and people from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Income inequality varies considerably across the OECD countries.
In 2016, the Gini coefficient ranged from around 0.25 in the
Czech Republic, Slovak Republic and Slovenia to almost twice
that value in Chile and Mexico (Figure 6.1). The Nordic and some
central and continental European countries have the lowest
inequality levels of disposable income, while inequality is high in
South American countries, Turkey and the United States.
Alternative indicators of income inequality suggest similar
rankings. The gap between the average income of the richest 10%
and the poorest 10% of the population was 9.3 to 1 on average
across OECD countries in 2016. The gap ranged from 5.2 to 1 in the
Czech Republic and Slovenia to almost four times larger in Chile
and Mexico (20 to 1). Over the past three decades, the gap
between the rich and poor has widened in the large majority of
OECD countries. During that period, the Gini coefficient increased
by three points to an OECD average level of 0.32.
Emerging economies have higher levels of income inequality
than most OECD countries, particularly China and South Africa.
Inequality also increased in many emerging economies, but
there are encouraging signs of stabilisation in China and even
declines in Brazil and several other Latin American countries.
Household wealth is much more unequally distributed than
income. On average, households in the top 10% of the wealth
distribution own more than half (52%) of all total household
wealth, and as much as 79% in the United States (Figure 6.2). In
comparison, the richest 10% of income earners get on average
around a quarter (24%) of all cash income, ranging from 20% in
the Slovak Republic to 36% in Chile. While wealth inequality is
higher that income inequality in all countries reviewed,
countries with lower income inequality levels are not
necessarily those with low wealth concentration, as witnessed
by the examples of Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands.
High and increasing levels of inequality of outcomes tend to be
an obstacle to income and social mobility. It could take on
average four to five generations for the offspring of a family in
the bottom 10% of the income distribution to reach the average
income (Figure 6.3). In low-inequality and high-mobility
countries, such as the Nordic countries, it would take two to
three generations – 50 to 100 years – for those born in lowincome families to approach the mean income in their society.
But in high-inequality and low-mobility countries, such as the
emerging countries Brazil, Colombia and South Africa, this shift
would take even nine generations or more, if these probabilities
of earnings mobility are not to change. In Colombia, where
persistence is the highest, it would take at least 300 years for the
offspring of low-income families to reach the mean.
To tackle inequality and promote opportunities for all, countries
should adopt a comprehensive policy package, centred around
four main areas: promoting greater participation of women into
the labour market; fostering employment opportunities and
good quality jobs; strengthening quality education and skills
development, and adaptation during the working life; and a
better design of tax and benefits systems for efficient
redistribution. The OECD’s Inclusive Growth Initiative outlines a
comprehensive approach to tackling inequality in all
dimensions and promoting higher living standards.

98

Definition and measurement
The main indicator of income distribution used is the Gini
coefficient. Values of the Gini coefficient range from 0 in the
case of “perfect equality” (each person receives the same
income) and 1 in the case of “perfect inequality” (all income
goes to the person with the highest income). Gini
coefficients are based on disposable equivalised household
incomes – i.e. post-taxes and social transfers and adjusted
for differences in the needs of households of different sizes
with an equivalence scale that divides household income
by the square root of household size. An alternative
indicator is the S90/S10 income decile share, corresponding
to the gap between the average incomes of the richest and
the poorest 10% of the population, also based on
equivalised disposable income. Income data are from the
OECD Income Distribution Database, http://oe.cd/idd.
Wealth data refers to net private household wealth, that is
the value of all assets owned by a household less the value
of all its liabilities at a particular point in time, around 2015
here. Data are from the OECD Wealth Distribution database,
http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=WEALTH.
The estimated numbers of generations are based on
earnings persistence (elasticities) between fathers and sons
and the current level of household incomes of the bottom
decile and the mean, assuming constant elasticities,
following Bowles and Gintis (2002). Low-income family is
defined as the first income decile, i.e. the bottom 10% of the
population. These estimates are simulation-based and
intended to be illustrative; they should not be interpreted as
giving the precise time that a person from a low-income
household will need to reach the average income.

6. EQUITY INDICATORS

Poverty
Income poverty rates measure the share of people at the
bottom end of the income distribution. Society’s equity
concerns are typically greater for the relatively disadvantaged.
As a result, poverty measures often receive more attention than
income inequality measures, with greater concerns for certain
groups like older people and children, who have no or limited
options for working their way out of poverty.
The average OECD relative poverty rate (i.e. the share of people
living with less than half the median disposable income in
their country) was 11.7% in 2016 for the OECD (Figure 6.4).
Poverty rates were highest in Israel and the United States at
almost 18%, while poverty in Denmark and Finland affected only
5-6% of the population. Mediterranean countries, South
American countries and Baltic countries have relatively high
poverty rates. Emerging economies also have higher levels of
poverty than most OECD countries, particularly China and
South Africa.
Relative poverty rates vary by gender. The average poverty rate
for women equals 12.3% and 10.9% for men. Women face a
higher risk of poverty than men in all OECD countries and key
partners, except in Denmark, Finland and Greece. The largest
gender poverty gaps are observed in Estonia, Latvia and Korea,
where the poverty rates among women are 4 to 6 percentage
points higher than men.
Changes in relative income poverty have been limited over the
last decade. Between 2007 and 2016, only in Hungary and
Lithuania poverty rose by more than 3 percentage points (Bars in
Figure 6.5). Over the same period, it fell in Australia and Finland,
while changes were below 2 percentage points in the other
OECD countries. By using an indicator which measures poverty
against a benchmark “anchored” to half the median real
incomes observed in 2005 (i.e. keeping constant the value of
the 2005 poverty line), recent increases in income poverty are
much higher than suggested by “relative” income poverty.
This variation is particularly pertinent in Greece and Spain
(“symbols” in Figure 6.5). While relative poverty did not increase
much or even fell in these countries, “anchored” poverty
increased by 5 percentage points or more between 2007 and
2016, reflecting disposable income losses of poorer households
in those countries. Only in Chile “anchored” poverty fell by more
than 7 percentage points reflecting significant income gains of
poorer households.
Relative poverty rates also vary by age group. On average across
OECD countries, poverty is lower among adults at 10%, while it is
higher at 13% for children and almost 14% for youth and elderly.
Child poverty is low in Nordic countries but highest in Chile,
Israel, Spain, Turkey and the United States, where more than
one in five children is income-poor. Poverty rates amongst youth
were particularly high in Denmark and Norway, countries where
youth leave parent’s home early and become economically
independent. But rates were also high in Spain where youth
unemployment rates ballooned during the crisis years. Very
high poverty rates among elderly are observed in a few
countries, often related to maturation of pension systems. For
instance, old-age poverty rates were highest in Korea, where the
recent pension system has not fully matured. In Australia and
Switzerland, old-age poverty rates are partly related to the fact

100

that many pensioners have taken their accumulated pensions
as lump sums (which are not counted as current income) rather
than annuitising them to provide income streams. In Estonia,
Latvia and Mexico, the level of safety net benefits for elderly is
very low.

Definition and measurement
As with income inequality, the starting point for poverty
measurement is the concept of equivalised household
disposable income (see “Definition and measurement” of
the “Household income” or “Income inequality” indicators).
The poverty rate is a headcount of how many people fall
below the poverty line. People are classified as poor when
their equivalised disposable household income is less than
50% of the median prevailing in each country. The use of a
relative income threshold means that richer countries have
the higher poverty thresholds. Higher poverty thresholds in
richer countries capture the notion that avoiding poverty
means an ability to access to the goods and services that
are regarded as customary or the norm in any given county.
Poverty rates by age group are computed based on the
median income for the entire population.
Changes in relative poverty referring to the current
median income can be difficult to interpret around
recessions. In a situation where the incomes of all
households fall, but they fall by less at the bottom than at
the middle, relative poverty will decline. Therefore, more
“absolute” poverty indices, linked to past living standards,
are needed to complement the picture provided by relative
income poverty. Therefore changes in poverty are also
presented in Figure 6.5 using an indicator which measures
poverty against a benchmark “anchored” to half the
median real incomes observed in 2005.
Data are from the OECD Income Distribution Database, http://

Cash transfers for working-age people provide a major income

layers of support can be distinguished: primary unemployment
i n s u ra n c e b e n e f i t s a n d s e c o n d a ry b e n e f i t s ( s u ch a s
unemployment assistance or guaranteed minimum-income
benefits) for those who are not or no longer entitled to insurance
benefits. These guaranteed minimum-income benefits (GMI)
provide financial support for low-income families to ensure an
acceptable standard of living and play a crucial role as last-resort
safety nets for long-term unemployed people.
In 2016, the shares of working-age individuals receiving outof-work benefits were highest in France, Finland, Ireland and
the United States, with rates above 10% (Figure 6.7). At the
other end of the spectrum, in Chile, Israel, Japan, Korea and
Turkey, less than 4% of the working-age population received at
least one of these payments. These differences in the number
of recipients reflect not only differences in employment rates,
but also differences in benefit entitlement rules. In countries
with the highest levels of receipt, entitlement to GMI benefits
extends to low-income working families. In some countries
(including France and Ireland), earnings from work can be
combined with unemployment insurance payments under
certain conditions.
On average, 5.8% of the working-age population received outof-work benefits in the OECD in 2016. The rate was still above
pre-crisis levels in many countries, especially those countries
where unemployment remained elevated in 2016 (including
Ireland, Lithuania and Spain) and in countries with a higher
number of recipients of means-tested benefits (Finland, France,
the Netherlands and the United States). In other countries
(Czech Republic, Hungary, New Zealand and Slovak Republic),
levels of benefit recipiency fell. This drop partly reflects a fall in
benefit coverage among the unemployed as a result of either
policy changes that have tightened eligibility conditions or
changes in the composition of the unemployed that have led to
fewer people meeting these conditions (OECD, 2018[1]).
In a large majority of OECD countries, the levels of primary
unemployment insurance benefits are typically significantly
higher than those of GMI benefits (Figure 6.8). On average
across the OECD, 58% of net income in work is maintained in
the initial phase of an unemployment spell for a single
person without children with previous earnings at the
average wage, but this falls to 31% once they become longterm unemployed.
GMI benefits are sometimes significantly lower than
commonly used poverty thresholds (Figure 6.9). Indeed, in a
few countries, a single person without children who has
exhausted unemployment benefit entitlement receives no cash
support at all: Turkey has no GMI benefit and in the
United States support takes the form of “food stamps” from the
Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Programme. For those
living in rented accommodation, housing-related benefits like
rent allowances can provide significant further income
assistance, bringing overall incomes close to or somewhat above
the poverty line (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, the
Netherlands and the United Kingdom). However, in all countries
GMI benefits alone are insufficient to escape poverty. Family
incomes in these cases depend strongly on the type of housing
and family arrangements.

102

Definition and measurement
Figure 6.7 shows the number of recipients as shares of
working-age individuals. Benefits that are awarded at
family level (e.g. social assistance) are only counted once
per family. Data are based on the OECD Social Benefit
Recipients Database (SOCR), which covers all main income
replacement benefits in 40 EU and OECD countries.
Depending on the data made available by countries, SOCR
includes caseloads, flows and average amounts of benefits,
and currently covers eight years (2007-14). Primary out-ofwork benefits are typically received during an initial phase
of unemployment (unemployment insurance in most
countries). Some countries that have no unemployment
insurance instead operate means-tested unemployment
assistance as the primary benefit.
The net replacement rate (NRR) measures the fraction of net
income in work that is maintained when unemployed. It is
defined as the ratio of net income while out of work divided
by net income while in work. The NRR presented here
corresponds to a 40 year-old single person without children
who earns 100% of the average wage. Initial phase of
unemployment refers to the second month of benefit
following any waiting period, and long-term unemployment
refers to the 60th month of benefit receipt. Family incomes
are simulated using the OECD Tax-Benefit Model (www.oecd.
org/social/benefits-and-wages.htm).
One way of looking at how countries’ social protection
systems perform is to show how the level of net minimum
cash income benefits (including housing assistance)
compares to relative poverty thresholds of 50% or 60% of
median household incomes. These income levels account
for all cash benefit entitlements of a family with a workingage head, with no other income sources and no entitlements
to primary benefits such as unemployment insurance.
They are net of any income taxes and social contributions.
Median disposable incomes (before housing costs) come
from the OECD Income Distribution Database (www.oecd.org/
social/income-distribution-database.htm).

Social spending
In 2018, public social spending was just over 20% of GDP on
average across the 36 OECD countries (Figure 6.10). Public social
spending-to-GDP ratios are highest in France at just over 30% of
GDP, while Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy
and Sweden devoted more than a quarter of their GDP to public
social spending. At the other end of the spectrum are mostly
non-European countries such as Chile, Korea, Mexico and
Turkey, which spend less than 13% of GDP on public social
support. Social spending in the emerging economies in the early
2010s was lower than the OECD average, ranging from around
3% of GDP in India to about 17% in Brazil.
At its peak during the Great Recession, public social
expenditure amounted to 22% of GDP on average across the
OECD. Spending has edged downwards since 2009. Figure 6.10
suggests that it takes some time for social protection systems to
develop into comprehensive welfare states. Although still low in
i n t e r n a t i o n a l c o m p a r i s o n s , s i n c e 1 9 9 0 p u bl i c s o c i a l
expenditure-to-GDP ratios more than tripled in Korea and
Turkey. In a small number of OECD countries (Canada, Israel,
New Zealand, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Sweden) the
public social spending-to-GDP ratio is the same now as it was in
1990, or is even lower. The Netherlands is the country with the
biggest drop: a health care reform in 2006 led to a shift away
from public spending; since then, compulsory basic health
insurance is being financed through private funds.
On average in the OECD, pensions and health services account
for two-third of total expenditure. In a majority of OECD
countries, pensions are the larg est expenditure area
(Figure 6.11). In Anglophone countries and most other countries
outside Europe, health makes up for the bulk of public social
expenditure. In a few countries, such as Denmark and Ireland,
the largest share is devoted to income support for the workingage population.
Accounting for the impact of taxation and private social
benefits leads to some convergence of spending-to-GDP ratios
across countries (Figure 6.11). Net total social spending is
20-27% of GDP in about half of countries. It is even higher for the
United States at 30% of GDP, where the amount of private social
spending and tax incentives is much larger than in other
countries. It remains highest in France at 32% of GDP.
Cash social benefits are not always tightly targeted to the
poorest. In 2016, on average only 23% of public cash transfers
received by working-age individuals went to households in the
bottom 20% of the income distribution, while 19% went to
households in the top 20% of the income distribution
(Figure 6.12). These shares vary across countries. On the one
hand, more than 40% of cash benefits go the poorest 20% in
Australia, Finland and New-Zealand, countries with various
income-tested benefits. On the other hand, less than 15% of
cash benefits go the poorest 20% in Mediterranean European
countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain) and Luxembourg,
countries with a strong social insurance dimension where most
benefits are related to past earnings.

Definition and measurement
Social expenditure is classified as public when general
government controls the financial flows. Sickness benefits
financed by compulsory contributions to social insurance
funds are considered “public”, whereas sickness benefits
paid directly by employers to their employees are
classified as “private”. The spending shown in Figure 6.10
is recorded before deduction of direct and indirect tax
payments levied on these benefits and before addition of
tax expenditures provided for social purposes. Data after
considering the impact of private social spending as well
as the tax system (Total Net social) are presented in
Figure 6.11. Spending by lower tiers of government may be
underestimated in some federal countries.
Public social spending totals reflect detailed social
expenditure data for 1980-2015/17. Consistent with these
historical series, public social expenditure totals were
calculated for 2016, 2017 and estimated for 2018.
“Poorest 20%” and “Richest 20%” refer to the share of
public cash transfers received by working-age households
at the bottom and top quintiles of the income distribution.
Data come from the OECD Income Distribution Database.

Affordable housing
Having access to quality affordable housing is important to
reduce poverty risks, improve equality of opportunity and
make growth inclusive and sustainable. Housing trends vary
considerably across the OECD, in terms of tenure, affordability
and quality, representing diverse historical contexts, household
preferences and policy priorities across countries.
In most OECD countries, owning a home is much more common
than renting. On average, nearly 70% of households across the
OECD either owned their dwelling outright or with a mortgage in
2016, compared to 26% of households who rented a dwelling,
either in the private rental market or as subsidised rental housing
(Figure 6.13). A number of Eastern European countries – including
the Slovak Republic, Lithuania, Hungary, Latvia and Poland –
record a very high rate of homeownership, with over 70% of
households owning their dwelling outright, a result of the historic
sales of state-owned housing in the 1990s. In 2016, owners with a
mortgage outnumbered outright homeowners in Iceland, Norway,
the Netherlands, Sweden, Canada and the United States.
In contrast, just over a quarter of households across the OECD
rented a dwelling on average in 2016. Only Switzerland and
Germany are home to a majority of renters (60% and 55%,
respectively), with Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands each
recording more than 40% of households renting their dwelling.
Subsidised rental housing (social rental housing) is present in
27 OECD countries, yet the size of the social housing stock varies
widely across countries. According to the 2016 OECD Questionnaire
on Affordable and Social Housing, social housing plays a major role
in the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, France and the United
Kingdom, comprising more than 15% of the total housing stock.
Affordable housing is a challenge for many households across
the OECD, but low-income dwellers face a significant housing
cost burden. In sixteen OECD countries, more than 40% of
low-income owners with a mortgage spent over 40% of their
disposable income on a mortgage in 2016. The same was true for
low-income renters in private rentals in fourteen OECD countries
(Figure 6.14). In Greece and the United States, low-income dwellers
face a similar housing cost burden, regardless of tenure: in both
countries, more than half of the low-income population spent
over 40% of disposable income on rent or a mortgage in 2016.
Children are particularly exposed to poor housing quality. On
average, more than one-in-five children aged 0-17 live in an
overcrowded household in European OECD countries, with
considerable variation across countries (Figure 6.15). Over half
of all children live in overcrowded households in Hungary,
Latvia, Poland and the Slovak Republic, compared to less than
8% in Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands. In all countries for
which data are available, children in low-income households are
more than twice as likely as those in high-income households to
face overcrowded conditions.

Definition and measurement
Housing affordability can be measured in different ways.
Indicators often focus on the ratio between housing costs
and household income. Two common indicators are: i) the
housing cost burden (used here), which is the share of
households spending more than 40% of their disposable
household income on rent or mortgage; and ii) the share of

106

Definition and measurement (cont.)
housing-related expenditures (housing, water, electricity,
gas, etc.) relative to overall final consumption expenditures
of a household. Other indicators may aim to measure other
dimensions of housing affordability, such as the share of
households who cannot afford to keep their dwelling
adequately warm.
The subsidised rental market, also characterised as social
re n t a l h o u s i n g , i s d e f i n e d a s re s i d e n t i a l re n t a l
accommodation provided at sub-market prices and
allocated according to specific rules (see Fitzpatrick, S. and
H. Pawson, 2014). The private rental market is defined as
the for-profit segment of the rental market, in which rental
housing is provided at market-rates
Following the EU-agreed definition (Eurostat) a household
is considered overcrowded if it does not have at its
disposal a minimum number of rooms equal to: one room
for the household; one room per adult couple in the
household; one room for each single person aged 18 and
over; one room per pair of single persons of the same sex
between 12 and 17 years of age; one room for each single
person between 12 and 17 years of age and not included in
the previous category; one room per pair of children under
12 years of age.

7. HEALTH INDICATORS

Life expectancy
In 2016, life expectancy at birth on average across OECD
countries reached 80.6 years, an increase of more than ten
years since 1970 (Figure 7.1). Life expectancy at birth now
exceeds 80 years in two-thirds of OECD countries, with Japan,
Spain and Switzerland at the top of the ranking. The United
States, Latin America and a number of Central and Eastern
European countries have a life expectancy between 75 and
80 years. Among OECD countries, life expectancy is lowest in
Latvia and Lithuania, slightly below 75 years.
The gains in longevity can be attributed to a number of factors,
including an improved lifestyle, better working conditions and
education, as well as progress in health care. OECD partner
countries, such as Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, China, Indonesia
and India, have also achieved large gains in longevity over the
past decades, with life expectancy in these countries converging
rapidly towards the OECD average. There has been much less
progress in South Africa (due mainly to the epidemic of HIV/AIDS)
and the Russian Federation (due mainly to the impact of the
economic transition in the 1990s and the rise in risky behaviours
among men).
In the last couple of years, a number of OECD countries reported
slight falls in life expectancy. Reasons underpinning such
worrisome trend appear to be diverse. In North America, recent
declines in life expectancy at birth are linked to the increase in
drug overuse mortality due to opioids, as well as to a levelling off
in the decline in mortality from heart diseases (NCHS, 2018).
In the United Kingdom and other European countries, the life
expectancy slowdown has been partly due to peaks of deaths
among the elderly during the winter months (the impact of the
winter flu), along with a slowdown in the reduction in deaths
from heart diseases (Public Health England, 2018).
Life expectancy at birth varies by gender, at 83.3 years for
women compared with 77.9 years for men in 2016 on average
across OECD countries (Figure 7.1). The gap reaches 5.4 years on
average. In 2016, life expectancy for women in OECD countries
ranged from less than 80 years in Hungary, Latvia and Mexico to
more than 85 years in France, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg,
Spain and Switzerland. For men it ranged from less than
75 years in Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico and
Slovak Republic to more than 80 years in Australia, Iceland,
Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Sweden and
Switzerland.
Life expectancy also depends on the socio-economic status of a
person, as measured, for instance, by education level
(Figure 7.2). Higher education levels do not only provide the
means to improve the socio-economic conditions in which
people live and work, but may also promote the adoption of
more healthy lifestyles and facilitate access to appropriate
health care. On average among 25 OECD countries for which
data are available, women and men with the highest level of
education at age 30 can expect to live four to seven years
longer than people with the lowest level of education. These
differences in life expectancy by education level are particularly
pronounced for men, with a gap of seven years on average. They
are especially large in Central and Eastern European countries
(Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland and Slovak Republic)
where the life expectancy gap between higher and lower
educated men reaches more than ten years. Differences are less
pronounced in Canada, Sweden and Turkey.

110

Higher health spending per capita is generally associated with
higher life expectancy at birth, although this positive
relationship tends to level off for countries with the highest
spending per capita (Figure 7.3). Japan, Korean and Spain stand
out as having relatively high life expectancies while the Russian
Federation and the United States have relatively low life
expectancies, given their levels of health spending.

Definition and measurement
Life expectancy at birth measures how long, on average,
people would live based on a given set of age-specific
death rates. However, the actual age-specific death rates
of any particular birth cohort cannot be known in advance.
If age-specific death rates are falling over time (as has
been the case over the past decades), actual life spans will
be higher than life expectancy calculated with current
death rates. The methodology used to calculate life
expectancy can vary slightly between countries and could
affect a country’s estimates by a fraction of a year.
Life expectancy at birth for the total population is
calculated for all OECD countries using the unweighted
average of life expectancy of men and women. To
calculate life expectancies by education level, detailed
data on deaths by sex, age and education level are needed.
However, not all countries have information on education
as part of their deaths data, reducing the number of
countries presented in Figure 7.2.
For more details about health spending per capita, see
indicator “Health spending”.

7. HEALTH INDICATORS

Health spending
How much countries spend on health and the rate at which
such expenditure grows from one year to the next reflects a
wide array of market and social factors, as well as countries’
diverse financing and organisational structures of their
health systems.
In 2017, the United States continued to outspend all other
OECD countries by a wide margin, with the equivalent of
around USD 10 000 per person (Figure 7.4). This level of
health spending is two-and-a-half times the OECD average
(USD 4 000) and nearly 25% and 40% higher than Switzerland
and Luxembourg respectively, the next biggest spending
countries. Around three-quarters of countries fall within a
per capita spending range of USD 2 000-6 000. Countries
spending below USD 2 000 include Central European and
Latin American members of the OECD, together with Turkey.
The lowest per capita spender on health was Mexico with
USD 1 030 per person (26% of OECD average). Among the key
emerging economies, China, Indonesia and India spent
respectively 19%, 10% and 6% of the OECD average on health
in per capita terms in 2017.
Figure 7.4 also shows the breakdown of per capita spending
on health based on whether it is paid from government
sources or some kind of compulsory insurance, or through
voluntary means such as voluntary health insurance or
direct payments by households. The vast majority of health
expenditure comes either from government schemes
(Denmark, Iceland, Sweden and the United Kingdom) or
from some form of compulsory insurance (Czech Republic,
Germany, France, Japan and Slovak Republic). On average,
health spending through voluntary means represents
around 25% of total spending. The ranking based on the
different sources of spending remains broadly comparable
to the ranking based on total per capital spending.
Looking at changes over time, health expenditure grew in
2016 at 2.7% on average across OECD countries, the highest
rate since 2009 although still below pre-crisis levels
(Figure 7.5). Preliminary estimates for 2017 expect spending
to have grown again by around 1.8%.
Growth rates in health spending slowed down in the
majority of OECD countries in the past decade. Between
2009 and 2017, per capita health spending grew, in real
terms, by 1.5% annually on average across the OECD
(Figure 7.6). In contrast, in the period 2003-09, annual real
growth rates reached on average 3.7%. Three countries –
Greece, and to a lesser extent Portugal and Italy – even
displayed a negative average annual growth rate for the
period 2009-17. Only three countries – Hungary, Iceland and
Switzerland – recorded higher growth rates after 2009 than
before that year.
Policies to reduce health expenditure included controls on
public health worker salaries, halting recruitment as well

112

as actual reductions in the health workforce, cuts in fees
payable to health providers and the containment of
spending on pharmaceuticals (Morgan and Astolfi, 2014).
Korea, and Chile are the countries with the highest growth
rates within the OECD area at above 5% on an annual basis.
However, these rates are well below those experienced in
India, Indonesia and China, where real health expenditure
has been growing on annual basis at an average rate of 8%,
9% and 11% respectively between 2009 and 2017.

Definition and measurement
Heath expenditure measures the final consumption of
health goods and services. This measure includes
spending by both public and private sources on
medical services and goods, as well as public health
and prevention programmes and administration, but it
excludes spending on capital formation (investments
in infrastructure, machinery and equipment, as well as
software and databases).
To compare spending levels across countries, per capita
health expenditures are converted to a common
currency (US dollar) and adjusted to take account of the
different purchasing power of the national currencies
using Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) exchange rates.
For the calculation of growth rates in real terms,
economy-wide deflators are used. In some countries
(e.g. France and Norway), health-specific deflators
exist, based on national methodologies, but these are
not used due to limited comparability.

HIV/AIDS
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) remains a major public
health issue, with approximately 37 million people living with
HIV infection in the world in 2017, of which 27 million live in
Africa according to WHO. For the 28 European OECD
countries for which data are available, nearly 32 000 people
were newly diagnosed in 2016, corresponding to 6.4 new
cases of HIV infection per 100 000 population (Figure 7.7).
Latvia and Estonia had the highest rates of new HIV cases (at
17-18 per 100 000 population), followed by Ireland, Portugal
and Luxembourg (at 10-11 per 100 000 population). Hungary
and the Slovak Republic had the lowest rates, with around two
cases per 100 000 population. The average annual rates of
newly-diagnosed HIV cases have been fairly stable in OECDEurope over the past decade, but these averages hide diverging
trends across countries. In Estonia and Portugal, infection
rates decreased rapidly although they remain high, while
infection rates doubled in Iceland and Lithuania, albeit from
rather low initial levels. Men account for three-quarters of the
newly diagnosed HIV cases.
The predominant mode of transmission of HIV is through
same-sex sexual acts (40%; of which 99.7% relate to men
having sex with men), followed by heterosexual contact (32%).
Drug use through injections is another common mode of HIV
transmission (ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe,
2017).
HIV infection causes the onset of AIDS (Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome), which manifests itself
through many different diseases, such as pneumonia and
tuberculosis, as the immune system is no longer able to
defend the body, leaving it susceptible to different infections
and tumours. There is a time lag between HIV infection,
AIDS diagnosis and death, which can be any number of
years depending on the treatment administered.
The rate of newly-reported cases of AIDS in OECD countries
in 2016 was 1.5 per 100 000 population (Figure 7.8).
Following the first reporting of AIDS in the early 1980s, the
number of cases rose rapidly to reach an average of almost
four new cases per 100 000 population across OECD countries
at its peak in the middle of the 1990s. Public awareness
campaigns contributed to steady declines in new cases of
HIV/AIDS in the second half of the 1990s. The development
and greater availability of antiretroviral drugs, which reduce
or slow down the development of the disease, also led to a
sharp decrease in new cases since the mid-1990s. Mexico had
the highest AIDS reporting rates among OECD countries in
2016 (at 11 new cases per 100 000 population), followed by

114

Chile, Latvia and the United States (at around six new cases
per 100 000 population). The low rates in some countries may
be due to incomplete reporting.
The HIV/AIDS death rate also declined on average across
OECD countries in the last two decades. However, people
still die because of HIV/AIDS. In 2015, 18 000 lives were taken
away due to HIV/AIDS in OECD countries, corresponding to
an average death rate of 1.2 deaths per 100 000 population
(Figure 7.9). Among OECD countries, HIV/AIDS death rates
were highest in Latvia and Mexico, at four to five deaths per
100 000 population. Rates were slightly higher in Brazil,
Colombia and the Russian Federation, and a lot higher in
South Africa where HIV-AIDS caused more than 50 deaths
per 100 000 population.

Definition and measurement
The incidence rates of HIV (human immunodeficiency
virus) and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency
s y n d ro m e ) a re t h e nu m b e r o f n ew c a s e s p e r
100 000 population at year of diagnosis. However, since
newly reported HIV diagnoses may also include persons
infected several years ago, the data do not represent the
real incidence. Under-reporting and under-diagnosing
also affect incidence rates, and could represent as much
as 40% of reported cases in some countries (ECDC and
WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2017).
Death rates are based on numbers of HIV/AIDS deaths
registered in a country in a given year divided by the
size of the corresponding population. The rates have
been age-standardised to the 2010 OECD population
(available at http://oe.cd/mortality) to remove variations
arising from differences in age structures across
countries and over time. The source for the HIV/AIDS
death rates is the WHO Mortality Database.

7. HEALTH INDICATORS

Suicide
Suicide is a significant cause of death in many OECD
countries and accounted for over 152 000 deaths in 2016,
which represents about 12 suicides per 100 000 people.
The reasons for committing suicide are complex, with
multiple risk factors that can predispose a person to attempt
to take their own life.
In 2016, suicide rates were lowest in Turkey, Greece, Israel and
South Africa, at five or fewer deaths per 100 000 population
(Figure 7.10). Latvia, Slovenia, Korea, Lithuania and the
Russian Federation stood at the top of the ranking, with more
than 18 deaths per 100 000 population caused by suicide.
There is a thirteen-fold difference between Turkey and
Lithuania, the two countries with respectively the lowest and
highest suicide rates.
Death rates from suicide are three-to-four times higher for
men than for women across OECD countries (Figure 7.10).
In Iceland and Poland, men are at least seven times more
likely to commit suicide than women. While the gender gap
is smaller in Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, male suicide
rates are still at least twice as high as female suicide rates.
Suicide rates increased in the 1970s and peaked in the early
1980s (Figure 7.11). Since the mid-1980s, suicide rates have
decreased by around one third across OECD countries, with
pronounced declines in Hungary, for example. At the same
time, suicide rates have increased in countries such as Japan
and Korea. In these countries, there was a sharp rise in the
mid- to late 1990s, coinciding with the Asian financial crisis,
but rates have started to decline in more recent years. In some
other countries, suicide rates have increased in the last
decade. For instance, in the United States the rates increased
from 11.2 per 100 000 in 2000 to 13.8 in 2015, and most recent
data show that suicide numbers and rates in the United States
have continued to increase in 2016 and 2017 (NCHS, 2018).
A similar trend is observed in Mexico and Portugal. Finland
provides an example of a country that achieved significant
reductions in suicide rates over the past few decades, through
the implementation of suicide prevention campaigns,
although suicide rates still remain high in comparison with
other Nordic countries (OECD/EC, 2018).
On average, older people are more likely to take their own
lives, with 20 people aged 70 years or more per 100 000
compared with ten people aged 15-29 years (Figure 7.12),
but this pattern is not general across the OECD. Denmark,
France, Hungary and Korea are examples where older people
take their own lives more often than young people. The
largest increasing age gradient is found in Korea, where rates
amongst the eldest group are almost 13 times higher than
those of teenagers. In a minority of OECD countries like
Iceland, Ireland, Mexico and New Zealand, young people are
more likely to take their own lives than older people. Suicide
rates among under 30s are highest Estonia, Iceland and
New Zealand, with 15 or more suicides per 100 000 youth.

116

The rates are lowest in Mediterranean European countries
and Luxembourg.
Differences in suicide rates between men and women
become particularly important from 80-years old, where
suicide rates are five times greater for men than for women.
This pattern may reflect higher social isolation, possibly
following ending of a long-term partnership, of older men
compared to older women. It could also come from higher
incidence of diseases among men leading to suicides.

Definition and measurement
The World Health Organization defines suicide as an
act deliberately initiated and performed by a person in
the full knowledge or expectation of its fatal outcome.
Comparability of data between countries is affected by
a number of reporting criteria, including how people’s
intention of killing themselves is ascertained, who is
responsible for completing the death certificate,
whether a forensic investigation is carried out, and
what the provisions for confidentiality of the cause of
death are. Caution is required therefore in interpreting
variations across countries, as the number of suicides
in certain countries may be under-reported because of
the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of
data issues associated with reporting criteria.
Death rates are based on the numbers of deaths
registered in a country in a given year divided by the
size of the corresponding population. The rates have
been age-standardised to the 2010 OECD population to
remove variations arising from differences in age
structures across countries and over time. The source
for the death rates is the WHO Mortality Database.

Tobacco and alcohol consumption
Tobacco and alcohol are major risk factors for at least two of
the leading causes of premature mortality – cardiovascular
diseases and cancer.
On average, about 18% of the adult population smoked on a
daily basis in 2017 (Figure 7.13). Keeping measurement issues
in mind, variations across OECD countries seem to be large.
Smoking rates were lowest in Mexico and Iceland (less than
10% of the adult population) and highest in Greece, Hungary
and Turkey (above 25%). Rates are higher among men than
among women in nearly all OECD countries, with the
exception of Sweden and Iceland where the gender gap is less
than 1%. Apart from Austria and the Slovak Republic, all OECD
countries experienced a marked decline in smoking rates over
the past eighteen years. On average across the OECD, the rate
decreased by more than one fourth, from 26% in 2000 to 18% in
2017. Particularly large reductions occurred in Ireland, the
Netherlands and Norway. Among OECD partner countries,
smoking rates tend to be low in Brazil (7%) and high in
Indonesia and the Russian Federation (above 30%).
Alcohol consumption, as measured by recorded data on
annual sales, stands at 8.8 litres of pure alcohol per adult, on
average, across OECD countries, based on the most recent
data available (Figure 7.14). The Czech Republic, France and
Lithuania reported the highest consumption of alcohol with
11.5 litres or more per adult per year. Low alcohol
consumption is recorded in Turkey and Israel, as well as in the
emerging economies Indonesia and India, where religious
and cultural traditions restrict the use of alcohol for some
population groups. Although average alcohol consumption
slightly declined in many OECD countries since 2000 – by
about 0.7 litre per adult on average –, it has risen by two litres
or more in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, as well as in
key partner countries China and India. OECD analysis based
on individual-level data show that men of low socioeconomic
status are more likely to drink heavily than men of a high
socioeconomic status, while the opposite is observed among
women (OECD, 2015).
Adolescents establish addictions more quickly than adults
and regular smoking and drinking is associated with poorer
psychological, social and physical health outcomes, as well
as poorer educational outcomes, violence, injuries, drug use
and risky sexual behaviour (OECD, 2015). On average, one in
eight 15-year-olds reported smoking at least once a week.
Adolescent smoking rates ranged from less than 5% in
Canada, Iceland and Norway to around 20% in France,
Hungary and Italy (Figure 7.15). Boys reported significant
higher rates in Finland, Israel, Lithuania and Russian
Federation, while the opposite pattern prevailed in the
Czech Republic and Luxembourg.
As for drunkenness, on average, one in five 15-year-olds
reported that they had been drunk at least twice in their
life. Rates ranged from 10% in Israel to above 35% in
Denmark, Hungary and Lithuania (Figure 7.16). Boys are
more likely to have been drunk than girls, particularly in
Austria, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Russian
Federation and Switzerland. the United Kingdom is the only
country where girls more frequently report drunkenness
than boys.

Definition and measurement
The proportion of daily smokers is defined as the
percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who
report smoking every day. International comparability is
limited due to the lack of standardisation in the
measurement of smoking habits in health interview
surveys across OECD countries.
Variations are observed in the surveyed age groups, the
wording of questions, response categories and survey
methodologies (e.g. in a number of countries,
respondents are asked if they smoke regularly, rather
than daily). Self-reported behaviours may also suffer
from a social desirability bias that may potentially
limit cross-country comparisons.
Alcohol consumption is defined as annual sales of
pure alcohol in litres per person aged 15 years and
over. However, the methodology to convert alcoholic
drinks to pure alcohol may differ across countries.
Official statistics do not include unrecorded alcohol
consumption, such as home production, which may be
more common in some countries than in others.
Tobacco and alcohol consumption rates for 15-yearolds by gender are taken from the 2013/14 Health
Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study,
which collects information on many socio-economic
factors that affect health behaviour among children for
26 OECD countries. Indicators shown here by gender
are the percentage of 15-year-olds who smoke at least
once a week and those who have been drunk on two or
more occasions.

8. SOCIAL COHESION INDICATORS

Life satisfaction
Life satisfaction measures how people evaluate their life and
is a subjective indicator that complements more objective
indicators of life quality.
When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a
scale from 0 to 10, people on average across the OECD gave
it a 6.7 in 2016-17 (Figure 8.1). However, life satisfaction is
not evenly shared across OECD countries. People in Finland,
Denmark and Norway are most satisfied with their lives,
with scales of 7.5 and higher, and the other Nordic countries
are not much behind. The measured level of life satisfaction
in the Nordics is about 2.5 steps higher than in Greece, the
country at the bottom of the ranking. Other countries with
low life satisfaction include Turkey, Portugal, Hungary,
Estonia and Korea. Life satisfaction also varies between
emerging economies, from a scale above 6 in Argentina,
Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica and Saudi Arabia, to below 5 in
India and South Africa.
OECD average life satisfaction in 2016-17 is similar to 2006-07
levels (Figure 8.1). Life satisfaction declined in only nine out
of 36 OECD countries, with major drops in Greece, Italy and
Spain, three countries that were hit particularly hard by the
global economic crisis in 2008-09. In contrast, satisfaction
with life considerably improved in Latvia, Hungary and
Iceland.
Life satisfaction varies by socio-demographic group
(Figure 8.2). While men and women report similar levels of
life satisfaction on average across OECD countries, there are
large gender gaps in certain countries, like Italy and the
United Kingdom where men report higher levels than
women, and Japan and Korea where women report higher
levels than men. Life satisfaction tends to decrease with age
and young people are on average happier than older age
groups. Youth from Finland and Iceland are the most satisfied
with their lives in the OECD, while people aged 50 and over in
Greece report the lowest levels. A full-time job, higher
education and higher income increase the likelihood of
higher life satisfaction, while the place where you live (urban
versus rural) does not seem to influence life satisfaction on
average. Even so, life satisfaction in Australia and the Czech
Republic tend to be considerably higher in rural areas than in
urban areas, while the opposite is true in Korea, Latvia,
Lithuania and Mexico, as well as in all emerging economies.
A snapshot of people’s daily feelings and emotions is
presented in Figure 8.3, using the positive and negative
experience indexes of Gallup. Among OECD countries, the
composite “positive experience” index is highest in
Mexico and Norway and lowest in Turkey, while the
“negative experience” index is highest in Greece and
lowest in Estonia. Across these countries, high values of the
positive experience index tend to be associated with high

122

scores of life satisfaction, while there is only a weak negative
correlation between the positive and negative experience
indexes.

Definition and measurement
The Gallup World Poll asked respondents to: “Imagine
an eleven-rung ladder where the bottom (0) represents
the worst possible life for you and the top (10)
represents the best possible life for you. On which step
of the ladder do you feel you personally stand at the
present time?” The main indicator used in this section
is the average country score. The Gallup World Poll is
conducted in more than 150 countries around the
world based on a common questionnaire. With few
exceptions, all samples are probability based and
nationally representative of the resident population
aged 15 years and over in the entire country. While this
data source ensures a high degree of comparability
across countries, results may be affected by sampling
and non-sampling errors, and variation in response
rates. Data are available by some socio-demographic
groups.
The Gallup World Poll also presents the positive and
the negative experience indexes. The positive
experience index averages country responses to five
questions about whether the respondent experienced
a lot of enjoyment, smiled or laughed a lot, felt wellrested and learned or did something interesting the
day before the interview. The negative experience
index averages country responses to five questions
about whether the respondent experienced a lot of
physical pain, worry, stress, sadness and anger. The
index scores are the mean of all valid affirmative
responses to these items multiplied by 100.

8. SOCIAL COHESION INDICATORS

Confidence in institutions
A cohesive society is one where citizens have confidence in
public institutions and believe that social economic
institutions are not subjected to corruption. Confidence and
corruption issues are dimensions that are strongly related to
societal trust.
In OECD countries, on average less than half of the
population (43%) reported trust in their national government
in 2016-17 (Figure 8.4). Switzerland, Luxembourg and Norway
stood at the top of the ranking with more than two-thirds of
people reporting confidence. At the other end, less than one
third of the population reported confidence in Greece, Chile,
Italy and Slovenia. There is a six-fold difference between
Switzerland and Greece, the two countries with respectively
the highest and lowest confidence in national government.
Among emerging economies, confidence in national
government is highest in India and Indonesia, with
confidence levels comparable with Switzerland, and lowest in
Brazil and Colombia, but still higher than in Greece.
In most OECD countries, the share of people expressing
confidence in the national government is higher among
the richest quintile than in the poorest quintile of the
population; some of the largest gaps being observed in
Australia and New Zealand. However, the poorest share of
the population does report higher confidence rates than
their richer peers in four OECD countries (France, Greece
Turkey and the United States) and in several key partner
economies (Brazil, Colombia, India and South Africa).
Trust in the local police and military is considerably higher
than trust in the national government, with respectively
74% and 73% of the OECD population reporting confidence in
these two institutions in 2016-17 (Figure 8.5). People also
report having more confidence in the judicial system (52%
on average across the OECD) and in the financial system
(46%), but confidence levels vary significantly across
countries, with confidence in the judicial system ranging
from around 20% in Chile and South Korea to around 85% in
Denmark and Norway. Confidence levels for all institutions
are higher in 2016-17 than they were in 2006-07, except for
financial institutions, as a result of the financial crisis in
2007-08 that generated a severe economic crisis. Also trust
in the national government experienced a decline during the
economic downturn, with the greatest losses observed in
Chile and Greece (around 30 percentage points). Since 2014-15,
trust in the national government is rising again, as it is for
financial institutions.
Gallup World Poll data also present data on perception of
corruption in governments (Figure 8.6). On average across
OECD countries in 2016/17, more than half of respondents
( 5 4 % ) p e r c e ive d w i d e s p re a d c o r r u p t i o n i n t h e i r

124

government. Denmark and Sweden report the lowest levels
(under 20%) whereas the highest levels are perceived in the
Czech Republic, Italy, Lithuania and Spain at above 80%.
Perception of corruption is above the OECD average in all key
partner countries and is also above 80% in Colombia,
Indonesia and South Africa. In the last decade, perception of
corruption deteriorated most in Chile, Slovenia and Spain
while it improved most in Germany and Poland.

Definition and measurement
Data on confidence in institutions is taken from the
Gallup World Poll, which is conducted in more than
150 countries around the world, and based on a
common questionnaire, as translated into the
predominant languages of each country. With few
exceptions, all samples are probability based and
nationally representative of the resident population
aged 15 years and over in the entire country, including
rural areas. While this ensures a high degree of
comparability across countries, results may be affected
by sampling and non-sampling error, and variation in
response rates. Hence, results should be interpreted
carefully. Data are averaged over a two-year period to
minimise the impact of year-on-year fluctuations.
Data are available by some socio-demographic groups.
Data on confidence is based on binary questions: Do
you have confidence in each of the following: in the
national government, in financial institutions or
banks, in the judicial system and courts, in the local
police force, in the military.
Data on corruption perception is based on the binary
question: “Is corruption widespread throughout the
government in this country, or not?”

8. SOCIAL COHESION INDICATORS

Violence against women
Violence against Women (VAW) encompasses all forms of
violence perpetrated against women because they are
women. This includes all forms of physical violence, sexual
violence and abuse, psychological violence, economic
violence, and harassment. Other forms of violence against
women include harassment, rape and other forms of assault,
child marriage, human trafficking, female genital mutilation,
a lack of reproductive rights, social norms that devalue
women, and discriminatory laws that disenfranchise women.
The number of women who report having been victims of
violence in their lifetimes and those who report violence in
the past year is high in many countries. Across OECD
countries, 22% of women report having experienced
physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner in their
lifetimes, with more than 4% of women having experienced
intimate partner violence in the past year. More than one
third of women in New Zealand, the United States and Turkey
report having experienced interpersonal violence from a
partner (Figure 8.7). For most women who have experienced
physical or sexual violence, the perpetrator is someone they
know, rather than a stranger.
OECD Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) 2019 shows
that social norms and legal frameworks can either drive
processes of social transformation or act as barriers to
women’s empowerment. Despite years of advocacy to
protect women’s physical integrity, legislative progress has
been uneven across OECD countries. In 14 countries, the
legal framework protects women from violence, including
intimate partner violence, rape and sexual harassment,
without any legal exception. In 16 OECD countries, survivors
of violence still face legal obstacles: one country still allows
reduced penalties in case of so-called honour crimes; in four
countries domestic violence is not a criminal offense; in
11 countries, the law provides legal protection from sexual
harassment but does not include criminal penalties.
Social norms can also be powerful disincentives for women
to report and pursue legal recourse against perpetrators.
Social acceptance of domestic violence against women by
women themselves weakens the functioning of legal
frameworks and is an obstacle to addressing violence
against women. SIGI 2019 shows that within OECD
countries, 8% of women say that a husband may be
justified in hitting or beating his wife, from 1% or less in
Denmark and Ireland to up to 18% in Korea and 20% in
Germany (Figure 8.8). In emerging economies, acceptance of
violence against women can be much higher – 34% of
women in Indonesia and 61% of women South Africa say
that spousal violence can be justified.
A recent Global Study on Homicide, the United Nations Office
on Drugs and Crimes finds that while men are more likely to
be victims of homicide, women killed by intimate partners or
family members account for 58% of all female homicide
victims. Gender-related killing of women and girls is a global
phenomenon, with the highest rates of women and girls
intentionally killed in Africa and in North and South America.
Women also face violence and harassment outside the home.
According to a 2018 International Transport Forum report,

126

most women who use public transport feel exposed to
physical or verbal aggression, sexual harassment and other
forms of violence or unwelcome behaviour, leading to
personal stress and physical harm. On average across OECD
countries, almost one women in three report not feeling safe
when walking alone at night, compared to one in five for
men (Figure 8.9). Women feel safer in Iceland, Norway,
Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland, where less than one in five
women do not feel safe. By contrast, in Latin America, around
six women out of ten report not feeling safe. Women from
Brazil and South Africa report the highest shares at above 70%.

Definition and measurement
Figure 8.7 presents the percentage of ever-partnered
women who ever suffered intimate partner physical
and/or sexual violence, as well as the percentage of
women who have suffered intimate partner physical
and/or sexual violence in the past 12 months. Figure 8.8
presents percentage of women aged 15-49 years who
consider a husband to be justified in hitting or beating
his wife for at least one of the specified reasons, i.e. if his
wife burns the food, argues with him, goes out without
telling him, neglects the children or refuses sexual
relations. Data are from the Gender, Institutions and
Development Database 2019 includes the data used in
the OECD Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)
2019, a cross-country composite measure of genderbased discrimination in formal and informal laws, social
norms and practices in 180 countries.
Figure 8.9 presents the share of respondents who
replied “No” to the GallupWorld Poll question “Do you
feel safe walking alone at night or in the city or area
where you live?” See more details on the Gallup World
Poll in previous indicator “Life satisfaction”.

8. SOCIAL COHESION INDICATORS

Voting
Interest in politics is an important factor for social
cohesion. It is a key challenge for politicians to ensure that
citizens feel concerned by politics and participate as actors
in the political life of the society.
Voter turnout rates vary enormously across OECD countries.
A high voter turnout is a sign that a country’s political system
enjoys a strong degree of participation. Turnout rates in
parliamentary elections are above 80% in Belgium, Denmark,
Turkey and Sweden, but below 50% in Chile, Luxembourg and
Switzerland (Figure 8.10). Low turnout not only reflects
limited participation by registered voters, but also limited
registration by potential voters. In most OECD countries,
there has been a decline in electoral participation over the
last three decades. Between the early 1990s and the late
2010s, participation in parliamentary elections across the
OECD decreased from 75% to 65% on average.
One in four young people in the OECD report no interest at
all in politics, compared with one in five for all age groups
(Figure 8.11). Disinterest in politics among 15-to-29-year
olds is highest in the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Lithuania, with 50% or more reporting no interest at all,
compared with rates below 10% in the Nordics and Germany.
Chile, Italy and Mexico report the highest level of disinterest
in politics for the total population, whereas Japan joins the
Nordics and Germany with the lowest levels of disinterest.
Three-quarter of immigrants with host-country nationality
participated in the most recent national elections
(Figure 8.12). This OECD average share is slightly below that
of native-born (74% versus 80% respectively). Even when
accounting for age and education, the gap in voter
participation with native-born remains constant. Electoral
participation among immigrants is below that of nativeborn in most OECD countries, with the exception of Estonia,
Hungary, Israel, Lithuania and Poland.
In absolute terms, immigrants’ turnout is highest (around
90%) in Denmark and Belgium (two countries with a formal
obligation for all citizens to vote), and lowest in the Czech
Republic, Switzerland and Ireland (slightly below 60%). The
ra n k i n g i s re l a t ive ly s i m i l a r f o r t h e n a t ive - b o r n
participation. Gaps are widest, ranging from 12 to 20 points,
in the Nordic countries, Southern Europe, Ireland, Germany,
the Netherlands and Switzerland.

Definition and measurement
Voting in national parliamentary elections is one
i n d i c a t o r o f p e o p l e ’s p a r t i c i p a t i o n i n t h e i r
community’s national life. The indicator used here to
measure the participation of individuals in the
electoral process is the “Voting age population
turnout”, i.e. the percentage of the voting age
population (VAP) that actually voted – as available from
administrative records of member countries. The VAP
is an estimate as it is difficult to accurately account for
people who are of voting age but who are not
registered voters, whatever the reason.

Definition and measurement (cont.)
Cross-national comparisons for voter turnout data can
be affected by a variety of factors including, the legal
voting age, the voting registration system (automatic
or requiring action by the potential voter) and whether
voting is compulsory or not. In most OECD and
European countries, the legal voting age in the national
elections is 18 years old, but young people can vote
from age 16 in Austria and Brazil and from age 17 in
Greece and Indonesia.
Different types of elections occur in different countries
according to their institutional structure and different
geographical jurisdictions. For some countries, it
should be noted, turnout for presidential elections and
regional elections may be higher than for national
parliamentary elections, perhaps because those
elected through these ballots are constitutionally more
important for how those countries are run. Data about
voter turnout are extracted from the international
database managed by the Institute for Democratic and
Electoral Assistance (IDEA).
Data on interest in politics, are from the European Social
Surveys (ESS8-2016) and the Word Value Survey Wave 6:
2010-14 (WVS). The questions in both surveys ask about
How interested in politics and the respondent to choose
between 4 categories: “Very interested”, “Quite
interested”, “Hardly interested” and “Not at all
interested”. Data refer to the rate of people answering to
be not at all interested in politics.
Data on self-reported participation in most recent
election for the foreign-born and native born
population (Figure 8.12) are based on survey data (such
as the European Social Survey, the Global Social Survey,
or the Current Population Survey) therefore they differ
from IDEA data presented in Figure 8.10.

Figure 8.10: Voting age population (VAP) turnout statistics are
calculated by dividing the total vote by an estimated voting
age population. The voting age population (VAP) includes
all citizens above the legal voting age. Data refer to
parliamentary elections, with the exceptions of France,
Mexico, and Poland where presidential elections are
considered due to higher participation rates. For more

8. SOCIAL COHESION INDICATORS

Online activities
Despite a regular and significant increase during the last
decade, Internet usage continues to vary widely across OECD
countries and among social groups. In 2018, 97% and above
of the adult population accessed the Internet in Denmark,
Iceland, and Norway, but 65% did so in Mexico (Figure 8.13).
Differences in Internet uptake are linked primarily to age
and education, often intertwined with income levels.
In most countries, Internet uptake by young people is
nearly universal, but there are wide differences for older
generations. On average across the OECD, over 97% of
16-24 year-olds used the Internet in 2018 compared to about
67% of 55-74 year-olds. The Internet usage rate among 16-24
year-olds is nearing 100% in most OECD countries, except in
Mexico and Turkey (90%), Israel and the United States
(85-87%). By contrast, Internet usage among 55-74 year-olds
is still very heterogeneous across countries: above 90% in
Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway but only 40% in
Greece, 31% in Turkey and 28% in Mexico.
Most of online time is devoted to instant messaging and
social networking. In countries for which data are available,
people aged 14 and above spent more than three hours per
day on the Internet in 2016, whereas the duration increases
to 4.5 hours a day among young people (aged 14-24)
(Figure 8.14). The age gap is even higher in countries where
people use the Internet more extensively, such as the
Netherlands, Sweden or Portugal. Constant connectivity is
changing attitudes and behaviour in people’s personal life,
with the transfer of part of social relations online and the
blurring of work and leisure time.
More than one in ten adolescents across the OECD report
having been the victim of cyberbullying, either by message
or by picture (Figure 8.15). The highest cyberbullying rates in
OECD countries are found in Latvia (almost one in four), as
well as in Estonia, Hungary, Ireland and the United Kingdom
(Scotland), where more than one in five adolescents report
cyberbullying. The lowest rate is in Greece, with only five
percent of adolescents report having been victim to
cyberbullying.
The digital space can also introduces new risks and stress
sources into young people’s lives. Just as with traditional
forms of bullying, exposure to cyber-bullying – for instance,
the rapid creation and sharing of offensive messages or
comments, spreading of rumours, exclusion of victims from
online groups and other forms of harassment – is associated
with a wide range of negative outcomes, including
depressive symptoms, substance use, ideation and suicide
attempts (OECD Brief Children & Young People’s Mental
Health in the Digital Age, Shaping the Future).
Teenage girls are more likely than teenage boys to report
having been victim to cyberbullying. The gender difference
is especially large in Ireland and the United Kingdom, where
cyberbullying rates for girls exceed those for boys by more
than 10 percentage points. Only in Spain, boys report higher
rates of cyber-bullying than girls, by 3 percentage points.

Definition and measurement
Data on internet usage refer to the ICT Access and
Usage by Households and Individuals database which
provides a selection of indicators, based on the second
revision of the OECD Model Survey on ICT Access and
Usage by Households and Individuals (http://oe.cd/hhind).
Internet users are defined for a recall period of three
months.
Data on daily time spent on the Internet are from the
European Social Survey (ESS), an academically driven
cross-national survey that has been conducted across
Europe since its establishment in 2001. Every two
years, face-to-face interviews are conducted with
newly selected, cross-sectional samples. The survey
measures the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns
of diverse populations in more than thirty nations
(www.europeansocialsurvey.org/)
Data on cyberbullying refer to the percentage of 11-, 13and 15-year-olds who, when asked if they had been
cyberbullied with messages or with pictures and
presented with response options ranging from
“Haven’t” to “Several times a week”, responded “at least
once”. Adolescents refer to young people aged 11, 13
and 15 attending school. Data are based on the Health
Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) World Health
Organization Collaborative Cross-National Survey 2013-14
(www.hbsc.org/).

ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION
AND DEVELOPMENT
The OECD is a unique forum where governments work together to address the economic, social and
environmental challenges of globalisation. The OECD is also at the forefront of efforts to understand and
to help governments respond to new developments and concerns, such as corporate governance, the
information economy and the challenges of an ageing population. The Organisation provides a setting
where governments can compare policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good
practice and work to co-ordinate domestic and international policies.
The OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea,
Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the
Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.
The European Union takes part in the work of the OECD.
OECD Publishing disseminates widely the results of the Organisation's statistics gathering and
research on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as the conventions, guidelines and
standards agreed by its members.

OECD SOCIAL INDICATORS
This report, the ninth edition of the biennial OECD overview of social indicators, addresses the growing demand
for quantitative evidence on social well-being and its trends. This year’s edition presents 25 indicators, several
of which are new, and includes data for 36 OECD member countries and, where available, key partners (Brazil,
China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa) and other G20 countries (Argentina and Saudi Arabia).
The report features a special chapter on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people: their numbers,
how they fare in terms of economic outcomes and well-being, and what policies can improve LGBT inclusivity.
It also includes a special section based on the 2018 OECD Risks That Matter Survey on people’s perceptions of
social and economic risks and the extent to which they think governments address those risks. In addition, the
report provides a guide to help readers in understanding the structure of OECD social indicators.
