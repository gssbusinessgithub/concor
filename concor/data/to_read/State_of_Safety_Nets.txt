T

he need for social safety net/social assistance (SSN/SA) is a critical concern for
governments across the globe. Which
SSN/SA programs to choose, how to best structure and deliver them, and how to make them
fiscally sustainable over the long term are
important questions because the answers to
these questions affect the well-being of millions
of poor and vulnerable people around the
world. As the interest in and the use of SSN/SA
programs continue to grow, countries are also
exploring how to better integrate SSN/SA programs into their overall social protection and
jobs agenda.
The global focus on social protection and
jobs in general and on the role of SSN in particular has intensified. For the first time, social
protection is part of a comprehensive agenda of
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
SDG 1 calls to end (extreme) poverty in all its
manifestations by 2030, ensure social protection for the poor and vulnerable, increase access
to basic services, and support people harmed by
climate-related extreme events and other economic, social, and environmental shocks and
disasters. Target 1.3 (Goal 1) seeks to implement nationally appropriate social protection
systems and measures for all, including floors,
and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the
poor and the vulnerable. Naturally, many questions arise in implementing this agenda; for
example, what is deemed “nationally appropriate” in a given country or context? What is a
mix of SSN/SA programs and interventions
that makes sense in a specific context or a given
set of policy objectives? How much of the SSN
spending is too little versus too much?
A robust evidence base is needed to answer
these questions. The main objective of this
book is to benchmark where individual countries, regions, and the world stand in terms of
SSN/SA spending and key performance indicators, such as program coverage, beneficiary
incidence, benefit level, and impacts on
reducing poverty and inequality. To evaluate
and benchmark these indicators consistently
across space (countries/programs) and time, a

major data collection and processing effort
is required. This has been the goal of a
World Bank initiative called Atlas of Social
Protection: Indicators of Resilience and
Equity (ASPIRE), a compilation of comprehensive social protection indicators derived
from administrative and household survey
data (http://datatopics.worldbank.org/aspire/).
The empirical analysis presented in this edition
of the book uses administrative (program-level)
data for 142 countries and household ­survey
data for 96 countries.
The evidence presented unequivocally indicates that SSN/SA programs matter. The book
shows that SSN investments in coverage and
adequacy reduce the poverty gap/headcount
and lower income inequality, and coverage of
the poor tends to be larger in those places
where coverage of the general population is also
­substantial. It is not surprising that coverage
and adequacy of SSN/SA programs come at a
fiscal cost; globally, developing and transition
economies spend an average of 1.5 percent
of gross domestic product (GDP) on these
­programs. Whereas many countries still do not
spend enough on SSN/SA programs to affect
poverty, others have dedicated spending that
has helped millions escape extreme poverty and
millions more to become less poor.
For the poor and vulnerable around the world,
much more needs to be done, and much more
can be done regarding SSN/SA programs.
Significant gaps in coverage and benefit levels
remain. Even more disconcerting is that the gaps
are more pronounced in low-income countries.
The data suggest that in low-income countries,
SSN/SA programs cover only 18 percent of
the poorest quintile, and the average transfer
accounts for only 13 percent of the lowest quintile’s consumption. The international development community needs to stand ready to work
further with countries in addressing the gaps.
Beyond presenting the key numbers on
spending and performance around the world,
this book also dives deeper into two thematic
areas pertinent to managing risk and vulnerability. The first is social assistance and aging,
xi

which looks specifically into the role of old-age
social pensions. The s­econd is adaptive social
protection, which discusses shocks and how
SSN/SA programs can be adapted to better
respond to them. It is clear that the risk of
old age is more predictable, but the risk of
­natural disasters is much less so; hence, different approaches and instruments are needed to
help people manage those risks.
We are excited to offer you the full range of
data and analysis that inform this book, and we

hope that you will keep coming back to this book
as a reference guide and a compass to chart your
thinking on the issues presented here. In the
meantime, we look forward to producing, sharing, and disseminating the latest global, regional,
and country-level data and developments in
this crucial field of social safety nets, through this
2018 edition and the ones to come. The reader is
encouraged to further explore the rich dataset
that the ASPIRE online platform offers.
I hope you enjoy reading this book.

Executive Summary

T

he State of Social Safety Nets 2018 aims to
compile, analyze, and disseminate data
and developments at the forefront of the
social safety net (SSN)/social assistance (SA)
agenda.1 This series of periodic reports is part of
broader efforts to monitor implementation
progress of the World Bank 2012–2022 Social
Protection and Labor Strategy against the strategic goals of increasing coverage—especially
among the poor—and enhancing the poverty
impact of the programs.2
This third edition of The State of Social Safety
Nets examines trends in coverage, spending,
and program performance using the World
Bank Atlas of Social Protection Indicators of
Resilience and Equity (ASPIRE) updated
database.3 The book documents the main safety
net programs that exist around the world and
their use to alleviate poverty and build shared
prosperity. The 2018 edition expands on the
2015 version in its coverage of administrative
and household survey data. This edition is distinctive, in that for the first time it describes
what happens with SSN/SA program spending
and coverage over time, when the data allow
such analysis.
The State of Social Safety Nets 2018 also features two special themes—social assistance and
aging, focusing on the role of old-age social
pensions; and adaptive social protection, focusing on what makes SSN systems and programs
adaptive to various shocks.
This book provides much-needed empirical
evidence in the context of an increasing global
focus on social protection, as is evident in the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).4 For
the first time, social protection is part of a comprehensive SDG agenda. SDG 1 calls to end
(extreme) poverty in all its manifestations by
2030, ensure social protection for the poor and
vulnerable, increase access to basic services,
and support people harmed by climate-related
extreme events and other shocks and disasters.
Target 1.3 (Goal 1) seeks to implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and
measures for all, including floors, and by 2030

achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the
vulnerable. Target 1.5 (Goal 1), which relates to
adaptive social protection, aims to build the
resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable
situations and to reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events
and other economic, social, and environmental
shocks and disasters. Measuring performance
on those targets requires reliable data.
As chapter 1 shows, most countries have
a diverse set of SSN/SA instruments. Of
142 countries in the ASPIRE administrative
database, 70 percent have unconditional cash
transfers, and 43 percent have conditional
cash transfers. More than 80 percent of countries provide school feeding programs. Also,
67 percent of countries have public works, and
56 percent have various fee waivers. The number of countries with old-age social pensions
has also grown rapidly in the past two decades.
A growing commitment to SSN/SA is also
evident; many countries tend to spend more on
these programs over time. From the analysis of
the subset of countries with comparable data
over time, chapter 2 shows that in the Latin
America and the Caribbean region, for example, average spending on SSN/SA programs as
a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP)
increased from 0.4 percent of GDP in 2000 to
1.26 percent of GDP in 2015. This happened
while regional GDP grew, which means that
SSN spending has increased in relative and
absolute terms. Many countries in other
regions, including Europe and Central Asia
and Sub-Saharan Africa, have also substantially increased their spending on flagship
SSN programs.
Globally, developing and transition countries
spend an average of 1.5 percent of GDP on SSN
programs. However, as chapter 2 highlights,
spending varies across countries and regions.
The Europe and Central Asia region currently
spends the most on SSN programs, with
average spending of 2.2 percent of GDP; the
Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and
the Caribbean regions are in the middle of the
1

spending range; and the Middle East and North
Africa and South Asia regions spend the least,
at 1.0 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.
The increase in spending has translated into
a substantial increase in program coverage
around the world. For example, several countries are introducing flagship SSN programs
and are rapidly expanding their coverage. In
Tanzania, the Productive Safety Net Program
expanded from covering 2 percent to 10 percent
of the population between 2014 and 2016. In
Senegal, the National Cash Transfer Program
expanded from 3 percent to 16 percent of the
population in four years. In the Philippines, the
Pantawid conditional cash transfer program has
expanded from 5 percent to 20 percent of the
population since 2010. These examples are only
a few of the rapidly expanding programs.
Chapter 3 shows that SSN programs are
making a substantial contribution to the fight
against poverty. From the available household
survey data, it is estimated that 36 percent of
people escape absolute poverty because of
receiving SSN transfers.5 In other words, in the
absence of transfers, many more people would
be living in absolute poverty. Even if the SSN
transfers do not lift the beneficiaries above the
poverty line, they reduce the poverty gap by
about 45 percent.6 SSN programs also reduce
consumption/income inequality by 2 percent,
on average. These positive effects of SSN transfers on the poverty headcount, poverty gap,
and inequality are observed for all country
income groups.
Despite the progress that has been made, the
social protection community needs to do more.
Significant gaps in program coverage persist
around the globe. These gaps are especially pronounced in low-income countries, where only
18 percent of the poorest quintile are covered
by SSN programs. Even in lower-middle-­
income countries, less than 50 percent of the
poor have access to SSN programs. Moreover,
very few of the poor are included in social
insurance programs. As the book suggests (see
chapter 3), coverage is much better in uppermiddle-­
income countries and high-income
countries, but even there the gaps remain.7
Benefit levels also need to be increased.
As chapter 3 shows, SSN benefits as a share of
the poor’s income/consumption are lowest in
low-income countries, at only 13 percent. The
2

situation is not much better in lower-middle-­
income countries, where the ratio stands at
18 percent. The book also shows that countries
differ substantially in absolute average per capita SSN spending (in terms of U.S. dollars, in
purchasing power parity terms). For example,
Sub-Saharan African countries spend an average of US$16 per citizen annually on SSN programs, whereas countries in the Latin America
and the Caribbean region spend an average of
US$158 per citizen annually.
It is important to close these gaps because
countries with low coverage and benefit levels
achieve only a very small reduction in poverty.
Analysis of the ASPIRE database indicates that
only countries with substantial coverage and
benefit levels make important gains in poverty
reduction. Countries with the highest levels of
coverage combined with high benefit levels
achieve up to a 43 percent reduction in the
poverty headcount (the share of the population
in the poorest quintile). Similar strong effects
are found with respect to reduction in the poverty gap and decline in income/consumption
inequality.
This book also goes beyond data analytics
and considers two specific areas of social protection policy that require further understanding and exploration: social assistance and aging
and adaptive social protection. Under the first
special topic, chapter 4 looks through the
numerical lens on the growing role of old-age
social pensions around the world. This is a
global trend largely reflecting the limited coverage and adequacy of contributory pension
schemes. The important contribution of the
chapter on old-age social pensions is its
attempt to quantify the poverty impact of this
policy instrument using household surveys
with reliable data.
Chapter 5 discusses the key features that make
SSNs adaptive to various types of shocks, both
natural (such as cyclones and droughts) and
human-made (such as conflicts and forced displacement). Adaptive social protection instruments are important for people, irrespective of
where they are in the life cycle. The chapter on
adaptive social protection aims to shed light
on what adaptability is about and how to
achieve it. It also highlights examples of what
countries are already doing to make their social
protection schemes more flexible and efficient.

1. The terms “social safety nets” and “social assistance”
are used interchangeably in this book. They are noncontributory measures designed to provide regular
and predictable support to poor and vulnerable
people. They are also referred to as “safety nets,”
“social assistance,” or “social transfers” and are a
component of larger social protection systems.
2. The World Bank 2012–2022 Social Protection and
Labor Strategy (www.worldbank.org/spstrategy) states
that the “overarching goals of the strategy are to help
improve resilience, equity, and opportunity for people
in both low- and middle-income countries through
integrated social protection and labor systems, increasing coverage of social safety nets programs, especially
in lower-income countries, and improved evidence.”

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

4. The ASPIRE database and the analysis for this book
consider social protection to consist of social safety
nets social assistance, social insurance, and labor
market programs.
5. Extreme poverty is measured with a poverty line of
US$1.90 per day in purchasing power parity terms.
6. The poverty gap is the distance between the poverty line and the average income of the poor. It is
typically expressed as the percentage shortfall
in income of the poor with respect to the
poverty line.
7. In this book, the high-income countries category
includes only a few high-income countries that are
members of the Word Bank Group and for which
household survey data are available. For a list of these
countries, see table 1.3 in chapter 1.

Explaining the Social Safety Net’s
Data Landscape

INTRODUCTION
What are social protection and social safety net
(SSN) interventions? How does this book classify SSN programs? What is the Atlas of Social
Protection: Indicators of Resilience and Equity
(ASPIRE) database? How does the ASPIRE
team collect data and ensure data quality? What
are the limitations of the administrative and
household survey data used in this book? How
is the performance of SSN programs measured?
This chapter aims to answer these questions,
and, by doing so, lays out the landscape for
understanding the book in its entirety.
WHAT ARE SOCIAL PROTECTION AND
SOCIAL SAFETY NET INTERVENTIONS?
WHAT IS THE ASPIRE CLASSIFICATION
OF SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS?
Social protection and labor (SPL) interventions
are well recognized for promoting resilience,
equity, and opportunity. The World Bank 2012–
2022 Social Protection and Labor Strategy:
Resilience, Equity, and Opportunity argues that
SPL systems, policies, and instruments help
individuals and societies manage risk and volatility and protect them from poverty and destitution (World Bank 2012). Equity is enhanced
through instruments that help protect against
destitution and promote equality of opportunity. Resilience is promoted through programs
that minimize the negative effect of economic
shocks and natural disasters on individuals and
families. Opportunity is enhanced through

policies and instruments that contribute to
building human capital and facilitate access to
jobs and investments in livelihoods.
SPL instruments generally fall into the following three categories:
1. Social safety net (SSN)/social assistance (SA)
programs are noncontributory interventions
designed to help individuals and households cope with chronic poverty, destitution, and vulnerability. SSN/SA programs
target the poor and vulnerable. Examples
include unconditional and conditional cash
transfers, noncontributory social pensions,
food and in-kind transfers, school feeding
programs, public works, and fee waivers
(see table 1.1).
2. Social insurance programs are contributory
interventions that are designed to help individuals manage sudden changes in income
because of old age, sickness, disability, or
natural disaster. Individuals pay insurance
premiums to be eligible for coverage or contribute a percentage of their earnings to a
mandatory insurance scheme. Examples
include contributory old-age, survivor, and
disability pensions; sick leave and maternity/
paternity benefits; and health insurance
coverage.
3. Labor market programs can be contributory or
noncontributory programs and are designed to
help protect individuals against loss of income
from unemployment (passive labor market

policies) or help individuals acquire skills and
connect them to labor markets (active labor
market policies). Unemployment insurance
and early retirement incentives are examples of
passive labor market policies, whereas training,
employment intermediation services, and
wage subsidies are examples of active policies.
This book, in its empirical analysis, focuses
on the state of SSN/SA programs. This focus
reflects an increased use of social safety net
instruments as well as the need to capture
up-to-date data and to assess the status of SSN
programs globally. The advance of available
data resources positions the ASPIRE team well
to analyze SSN/SA programs. In addition, by
focusing on the SSN/SA programs (as a subset
of SPL programs), this book provides continuity with the two previous books on the state of
social safety nets (2014 and 2015).
This book also extends to the broader SPL
agenda. The “Special Topics” section considers
old-age social pensions, which are linked to the
social insurance agenda, and adaptive social
protection, which can be achieved through both
safety nets and contributory/insurance programs. Ultimately, the policy issues related to
social safety nets, social insurance, and labor
market agendas are closely connected.
6

There is clear demand for a tool that helps
monitor the scope, performance, and effect of
SPL programs in countries worldwide. The
Social Protection and Jobs Global Practice of
the World Bank Group is committed to developing and continuously updating a comprehensive set of comparable and accessible indicators
to help measure the performance of SSN/SA
(as well as broader SPL) programs.
The Social Protection and Jobs Global
Practice has created a user-friendly benchmarking tool that continuously updates key
SSN/SPL indicators: ASPIRE. This portal serves
as a one-stop shop for SPL indicators for both
World Bank staff and external practitioners.
ASPIRE links directly to the World Bank Group
Databank to provide users with tools to search
the database and to generate customized tables
and charts. In addition, the portal includes
related survey information from the World
Bank Microdata Library.
For cross-country comparability, this book
follows the ASPIRE harmonized classification of SSN/SA programs. ASPIRE groups
SSN/SA programs into eight harmonized categories on the basis of program objectives
(see table 1.2 and appendix A). This classification is applied to each country in the database to generate comparable program

Note:
a. Conditional cash transfer programs aim to reduce poverty by making welfare programs conditional upon actions by the beneficiary.
The government (or an implementing agency) transfers the money only to those households or persons (beneficiaries) that meet certain
criteria in the form of actions, such as enrolling children in public schools, getting regular check-ups at the doctor’s office, receiving
vaccinations, or the like. Conditional cash transfer programs seek to help the current generation in poverty and to break the cycle of
poverty for the next generation by developing human capital.
b. Unconditional cash transfer programs do not require beneficiaries to perform any specific actions to be eligible for the benefit. However,
these programs may require benficiaries to meet certain criteria or have a certain status to be eligible; for example, for a poverty-targeted
benefit, a household must be below a poverty threshold.

social protection and labor programs. ASPIRE
has two main sources of data: administrative
data, from which program expenditures and
number of beneficiaries are derived; and household survey data, which are used to estimate the
coverage, benefit incidence, benefit levels, and
poverty/inequality impact of SPL programs.
The two data sources complement each other,
and thus provide a more comprehensive view of
SPL program performance around the world.
The ASPIRE work program supports continuous improvement in the quality, comparability, and availability of SPL/SSN data to
facilitate SPL benchmarking and inform policies. As of November of 2017, the ASPIRE database included administrative spending data for
124 developing and transition countries and
economies (see appendix D) and administrative data on the number of beneficiaries of
the largest programs for 142 countries (see
appendix C).1 This book uses only the most
recent subset of the ASPIRE data—specifically,
the most recent year of data available per
country. These data constitute the basis for the
analysis in chapter 2. For the performance
analysis presented in chapter 3, the book uses
the most recent household survey data from
96 countries (see appendix B).2 The examples
of monthly benefit levels per household for
selected programs are presented in a­ ppendix E.
Appendix F presents key performance indicators. Appendix G takes stock of old-age social
pensions around the world (which are discussed in chapter 4). The full list of countries
found in the household and administrative
data used in this book is presented, by country
income group, in table 1.3. Basic characteristics of these countries, such as the total country population and gross national income GDP
per capita, can be found in appendix H.
World Bank staff and in-country consultants
collect and harmonize the administrative data
using standardized terms of reference, data
templates, and classifications. Publicly available
government statistics, such as annual program
budget expenditures, are the primary source of
administrative data. In the case of donorfunded programs, the program budget provided by the donor is also considered a primary
source of data. Other information and data
received from program and sector officials, as

8

well as existing analysis such as public expenditure reviews, constitute the secondary source of
administrative data.
Although the SSN classification of programs
facilitates cross-country comparison, it does
not necessarily imply an easy and clean-cut
differentiation of programs. As mentioned,
ASPIRE classifies and aggregates individual
SSN/SA programs into eight categories, largely
on the basis of the objective and nature of each
program. However, in practice, program
objectives often tend to overlap, blurring
the line between classifications. For example,
although a cash transfer program may not
have explicit eligibility conditions (making it
an unconditional cash transfer), it may have
strong uptake incentive mechanisms or soft
conditions that influence decisions on how
households spend the transfer, making it in
principle a conditional cash transfer (Daidone
and others 2015).
Available program-level administrative
spending data currently covers 124 countries
representing 80 percent of the world’s population. Updates are available for 28 countries
through 2016; for 42 countries through 2015;
and for 41 countries through either 2013 or
2014. The year of reference for the remaining
countries in the database ranges from 2010 to
2013, except for Bhutan, Jordan, Marshall Islands,
and Vanuatu. For these four countries, only total
SSN spending is available from secondary
sources, and the reference year is 2009. Countries
with data points before 2009 are considered outdated and are not included in the analysis.
A complete summary of spending indicators
disaggregated by program categories can be
found in appendix D.3 The program-level administrative data facilitates a granular look at country-­
level spending on social safety nets/social
assistance. Furthermore, by comparing global
spending trends and patterns, the spending profiles and program portfolios of countries and
regions can be benchmarked.
The presence on the ground of the larger
ASPIRE and Social Protection and Jobs Global
Practice teams, including consultants, facilitates information flows that help improve the
quality of administrative data. The engagement
in the country helps establish a dialogue
with government counterparts and assists in

gathering the required information/data, verifying classification, and checking quality.
Continuous improvement to the data is ensured
by close collaboration between the ASPIRE
central team, the ASPIRE focal points in the
regions, and the World Bank Social Protection
and Jobs Global Practice staff at the country
level, who have extensive program knowledge.
When estimating the amount a country
spends on SSN programs, the book uses the
latest-available-year approach. For the list of all
active programs, the latest year for which

updates are available (as mentioned) is considered the reference year for which expenditures
are tallied. Unfortunately, for some countries,
spending information for the latest year is not
available for all active programs, but in many
cases prior-year information on spending is
available. In such cases, this prior-year spending (relative to the same-year gross domestic
product, GDP) is used. In sorting out the data,
the focus is always on updating the largest programs in terms of beneficiary numbers and
spending amounts. The analysis of spending

(see chapter 2) also distinguishes the inclusion/
exclusion of the health fee waivers in total SSN
spending whenever possible.4
Performance indicators are estimated using
nationally representative household surveys. As
of November of 2017, the ASPIRE database
included 309 household surveys, corresponding to 123 developing countries. The book uses
only the latest year for each country and only if
the data are from at least 2008; under this criterion, 20 countries were excluded. In addition,
several countries whose surveys did not have
SSN information were excluded: Cambodia
(2013), Mali (2009), Myanmar (2009), Samoa
(2008), Togo (2011), and Tonga (2009).5 As a
result, the performance indicators are based on
96 countries (see appendix B for a full list of the
household surveys used).
The ASPIRE team carefully reviews different
household surveys to identify relevant SPL program information. Typically, the surveys
include household income and expenditure
surveys; household budget surveys; living standards measurement surveys; integrated, multipurpose, and socioeconomic surveys; or any
other survey that is nationally representative
and captures information on social protection
and labor programs. In some cases, this work
also leads to recommendations made to government counterparts on how the design of the
survey instrument/module can be changed to
better capture SPL programs.
Individual variables are generated for each
SSN program captured in the survey; they are
then grouped into the eight harmonized program categories.6 The performance indicators
are generated using these harmonized program
categories. These indicators, in turn, can be disaggregated by quintiles of welfare before and
after transfers, extreme poverty status (defined
as US$1.90/day in terms of purchasing power
parity, PPP), and rural/urban populations.
Household weights are used to expand results
to the total population of each country.
For cross-country comparability, all monetary variables are expressed in 2011 prices and
daily PPP in U.S. dollars. This also facilitates the
PPP US$1.90/day poverty-line metric to determine the poverty status for each country/survey.
Note that 2011 is used as a base year because
this is the year when the most recent comprehensive global price statistics were collected as a
10

part of the International Comparison Program.7
The consumption or income aggregates used to
rank households by their welfare distribution
are validated by the World Bank’s regional poverty teams.
There are important considerations to keep
in mind when going through the performance
analysis. First, this analysis is limited to the
programs captured in the household surveys.
Most household surveys capture only a fraction of the programs administered in a given
country. Thus the data do not always include
a comprehensive list of programs (which are
likely to appear in administrative data)
implemented in each country. Accordingly,
coverage indicators are underestimated with
respect to overall social spending. To illustrate this point, the ASPIRE team conducted
a matching exercise, looking at program overlap between the administrative data and
household surveys for several countries (see
table 1.4). A few key messages emerge from
this exercise:
1. There is generally little overlap between
administrative and household data. In the
sample of counties (see table 1.4), on average only about 20 percent of programs can
be found in both administrative and household survey data; for some countries, the
matching rate is less than 10 percent.
2. Household surveys tend to capture larger programs, although only in part. On average, the
matching programs capture about 50 percent
of the SSN budget, as seen by summing up the
budget for the matching programs on the
basis of administrative budget data.
3. Every country case is unique. There are
significant variations across countries in
terms of how many programs are captured
in the household survey (as a percentage
of the total number of programs) and what
percent of the total budget they account for
in the administrative data. For example, in
Chile, 14 out of 135 programs (10 percent)
match, accounting for 30 percent of SSN
programs’ total budget; in Romania, 10 out
of 65 (15 percent) match, accounting for
96 percent of the total budget; and in South
Africa, 6 out of 16 (40 percent) match,
accounting for 85 percent of the total budget
(see table 1.4).

Also, some surveys collect information
only on program participation without
including transfer amounts. In such cases,
only ­
coverage and beneficiary incidence
indicators can be estimated. Last, because
­
household surveys differ in the method
for collecting SPL information across countries, the quality of the information varies.

For example, some surveys collect information on social programs mixed with private
transfers, making it difficult to isolate individual SPL programs. Despite these limitations,
household surveys have unique advantages
(see box 1.1) and are the sole source for calculating most p
­ erformance indicators presented
in this book.

BOX 1.1 Leveraging Household Survey Data to Monitor and Measure Social
Protection and Labor Program Performance
Household surveys have great potential as
instruments to monitor and assess the performance of social protection and labor (SPL) programs. However, not all countries use household
surveys to estimate SPL program trends or generate basic performance indicators (such as coverage, benefit level, benefits and beneficiary
incidence, and effects on poverty). A main factor
behind the low use of household data is the
inadequate SPL information captured in most
national household surveys. Thus there is a need
to improve data collection and the quality of SPL
information in household surveys to better
inform social policy.
Why are household surveys necessary to
measure SPL performance? Household surveys
are the only source of information regarding
potential beneficiaries and the basis for
ex ante simulations for policy reform. By
including information representative of the
total population, household surveys allow the
identification of populations that, because of
their characteristics, may be eligible for an
SPL program (for example, the poor, disabled,
and unemployed). Ex ante assessments can
be conducted for policy reforms by simulating
the effect of a newly introduced program
or parameter-adjusted existing programs.
In addition, ex post assessments facilitate
evaluating whether SPL programs are
reaching intended objectives. The availability
of total household income or consumption in
household surveys also enables analysis of
the distributional effects of SPL programs and
their effects on poverty and inequality.
How can household surveys be leveraged
to become key instruments for monitoring and
evaluating social policy? Leite et al. (forthcoming)
propose a series of recommendations to improve

the collection of SPL information in survey
instruments, including the following:
1. Review existing SPL programs in the country.
Obtaining a full list of programs and their
specifications (for example, target population,
benefit level, frequency of payments, and
program size) will help make the list of SPL
programs in the questionnaire more complete
and better formulate the survey questions
to capture adequate information. In addition,
information about the program size will help
evaluate whether a program is large enough
to be captured by the sample frame or if
oversampling is needed.
2. Identify and coordinate with key partners.
Coordination between policy makers, program
implementers, and National Statistical Office
officials is crucial to design a good set of
questions and sampling frame. The survey’s
representation of programs can be imprecise
if the sample does not overlap with areas
where the programs are implemented.
3. Design the best format to collect SPL program
information. Whenever possible, survey
questions should be specific for each program,
keeping answers at the individual level if the
programs are provided to the individual (and
not to the household). In addition, recording
the value of the benefit (or an estimated
value) makes performance analysis richer
because monetary-based indicators (such as
benefits incidence, benefit size, and effects
on poverty and inequality) can be estimated.
Moreover, different collection formats can be
explored, such as designing modules specific
to social safety net programs and/or placing
questions in sector-specific modules, given
that SPL programs tend to be multisectorial.

The State of Social Safety Nets 2018

Despite data limitations, the global SPL landscape today is much more accurate than even
a few years ago because of advances in the
identification, capture, and harmonization of
ASPIRE data. This global accumulation of
knowledge is reflected in this book, which builds
on more extensive data (more countries/programs captured) and adds sophistication of analysis relative to the 2015 book on the state of social
safety nets (Honorati, Gentilini, and Yemtsov
2015). Furthermore, for the first time, this book
attempts to look at SSN programs over time
when the data allow intertemporal comparisons.
HOW IS THE PERFORMANCE OF SOCIAL
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS MEASURED?
Performance measurement is the process of collecting, analyzing, and/or reporting information
regarding the performance of an individual,
group, organization, system, or program component. The objective is to determine if the results/
outputs align with the intention or the intended
achievement. Performance measurement estimates the parameters under which programs are
reaching the targeted results. By measuring performance, decisions can be made and interventions carried out to improve programs.
The analysis of SSN programs presented in this
book relies on a number of key terms/parameters. These parameters include spending/budget,
number of beneficiaries, coverage, beneficiary/
benefit incidence, benefit size/adequacy, and
poverty/inequality impact. This book focuses on
the core performance indicators found in the
ASPIRE database. Accordingly, the effects of SSN
programs in such areas as health or education
outcomes, saving behavior, labor supply, fertility,
and migration are not considered; these effects
can be measured only through rigorous impact
evaluations.8 The main contribution of this book
is to present a set of comparable core indicators
for many programs/countries, allowing a global
picture of social safety nets to evolve.
“Spending” indicates the program budget
In most cases, the costs of benefits provided
account for most spending. While most programs have administrative costs (which are
the costs of running/implementing the program), those are rarely available and/or cannot be separated from the amount spent on
benefits.

“Number of beneficiaries” is simply how
many people or households benefit from
the program
Usually, this information is available in the
administrative data. The intricacy here is related
to what the beneficiary unit is. Many programs
are targeted at households as a beneficiary unit.
In this case, it is often assumed that all household members benefit from the program/benefit, and hence the number of individual
beneficiaries is simply the number of individuals living in the beneficiary households. For
some programs, such as conditional cash transfers, very often a subset of the household members is assumed to benefit directly from the
program (for example, children who get vaccinations or go to school). In this case, the book
simply uses the number of direct beneficiaries
provided (through primary and secondary data,
as described earlier), without any further calculations. For individual-level benefits (for example, old-age social pensions), the number of
direct beneficiaries is reported (even though,
indirectly, all household members may benefit
from a household member receiving a benefit).
In any case, in the administrative data, the original beneficiary units are always reported (see
appendix C). For the household-level benefits,
the number of recipient households and the
number of individuals living in those households are reported.
“Coverage” indicates the absolute number of
program beneficiaries or percentage of the
population or a given population group that
benefits from a given SSN program
Coverage is important because it indicates
the size of the program “blanket” in both
absolute and relative terms. In the ideal world,
the number of beneficiaries from the administrative data could be closely matched by coverage (of the same program) from the
household survey data (using population
weights). However, as table 1.4 demonstrates,
this ideal is elusive. For the purposes of the
performance analysis (chapter 3), this book
evaluates coverage relying on the household
survey data. This approach is taken because
it would be helpful to know how various
­population groups (for example, poor versus
­nonpoor) are covered by the same program
(that can be found in the household survey).

Explaining the Social Safety Net’s Data Landscape

This level of analysis is simply not possible
using administrative data. Coverage, in combination with benefit size/adequacy, is very
often related to the program’s impact.

reduction in the measures of welfare (income/
consumption) inequality, such as the Gini
coefficient.

“Beneficiary/benefit incidence” shows which
segment of the population receives the
program benefits
The beneficiary/benefit incidence can indicate
what percentage of the total number of beneficiaries/total amount of benefits go to the poorest quintile of the welfare distribution. The
calculation of this indicator requires the use of
household survey data that include the welfare
indicator. Moreover, the household survey
needs to have the information about the SSN
programs for which the benefit incidence is
being assessed. Thus, the data demands are
very high when it comes to estimating this
parameter.

NOTES

“Benefit level” indicates the amount of the
benefit, whereas “benefit adequacy” is a
measure of the relative benefit level
The main purpose of estimating benefit adequacy is to get some idea of to what extent the
benefit size is small or large in comparison to a
benchmark (for example, average income/consumption in a country, poverty line, minimum
subsistence level, minimum wage, per capita
GDP). The impact evaluation literature
(cited later in this book) often finds that fragmented/small benefits fall short of achieving
desired developmental effects.
“Poverty/inequality impact” reveals the
distributional effects of the benefit
Regarding poverty impact, two indicators are
often looked at: percentage reduction in the
poverty headcount (prevalence) as a result of
the benefit; and percentage reduction in the
poverty depth (distance to the poverty line).
The cost–benefit ratio can also be calculated.
It indicates how much money, in U.S. dollars,
it costs to reduce a poverty gap by US$1. As
empirical evidence around the world suggests, many SSN benefits help poor people
become less poor (that is, reduce the poverty
gap/depth) rather than graduate entirely
from poverty. Many SSN benefits also often
help make societies more equal. This is estimated empirically by looking at the
14

1. Appendix C presents information available in the
ASPIRE database on the biggest programs (in terms
of numbers of beneficiaries) in 142 countries by
aggregate program categories. Countries differ significantly in the number of SSN programs operating
in the country, ranging from fewer than 10–15 (such
as in Bolivia, Croatia, or Timor-Leste), to more than
50 programs (such as in Burkina Faso, Chile, or
Vietnam). Thus, for some countries with a large
number of programs, appendix C does not present
the full picture of coverage or versatility of programs
and should be treated with caution.
2. Data availability here refers to the most recent data
available to the ASPIRE team. In some cases, more
recent household survey data may be available for a
given country, but these data have not been properly
processed yet, or the welfare aggregate has not yet
been derived, rendering the data unusable for calculating the performance indicators.
3. To calculate total spending as a percentage of GDP,
program-level spending is divided by GDP using the
GDP data from the corresponding year. In this chapter and in appendix D, the World Development
Indicators database (July 2017 version) is used for all
GDP data except for Timor-Leste, which uses the
World Economic Outlook database (April 2017 version). The World Bank income group classification as
of July of 2017 is used.
4. To make clear which categories of spending are presented in chapter 2, the figures and notes to each relevant figure indicate whether the data cover total
SSN spending (including health fee waivers) or “core”
SSN spending (excluding health fee waivers). This
technique could potentially be used with other categories, such as educational fee waivers.
5. For the household survey data to be included in the
analysis: (i) household surveys need to be nationally
representative; (ii) they need to include information
on social protection; (iii) there is a clearly defined
welfare aggregate (either income or ­consumption).
On the basis of these criteria, the household surveys
for Azerbaijan and Lesotho, for example, were not
used in the analysis. In the case of Azerbaijan, the
survey is a nonrandom sample of the applicants to
Targeted Social Assistance; in the case of Lesotho, it
is the only country in the sample where the asset
index (rather than ­consumption or income) is used
for welfare rankings.
6. SSN/SA includes eight harmonized program categories, whereas a broader SPL includes 12 harmonized
program categories. See appendix A for further
details.

Explaining the Social Safety Net’s Data Landscape

CHAPTER 2
Spending on Social Safety Nets

T

his chapter aims to answer four main
questions: How much do countries spend
on social safety net (SSN)/social assistance (SA) programs in relative terms, as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), and
in absolute terms?1 Do higher-income countries spend more, in relative and absolute terms,
compared to lower-income countries? How has
SSN spending changed over time? What is the
composition of SSN spending in terms of
the main spending categories and instruments?
HOW MUCH DO REGIONS AND COUNTRIES
SPEND ON SOCIAL SAFETY NETS?
Developing countries spend, on average,
1.5 percent of GDP on SSN programs. Aggregate
spending on SSNs, excluding general price subsidies, was examined for a sample of 124 developing countries for which data are available. SSN
spending is higher than the global average in
Europe and Central Asia, at 2.2 percent of GDP,
and about the global average in Sub-Saharan
Africa, at 1.5 percent, and in Latin America
and the Caribbean, at 1.5 percent. East Asia and
Pacific, the Middle East and North Africa,
and South Asia spend 1.1 percent, 1.0 percent,
and 0.9 percent of GDP, respectively (figure 2.1).
Countries in the Europe and Central Asia
region spend on average the highest share of
GDP on SSN globally. Georgia, at 7 percent of
GDP on SSN, spends the most in the region (see
appendix B). Spending in this country is driven
by the universal old-age social pension scheme,

16

which is part of the SSN system, as well as the
targeted social assistance program.
Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa spend
around the global average on SSN. However,
many programs in the Africa region are donorfunded (see figure 2.2).2 About two-thirds of
the United Nations High Commission on
Refugees budget is allocated to programs in
Africa, and this humanitarian assistance is
counted as SSN spending.3 The country with
the highest share of GDP spent on SSN is South
Sudan (10 percent of GDP), which has only two
emergency assistance programs, both of which
are fully financed by donors, reflecting the fragile environment in the country.4
The Africa region is very heterogenous in
its SSN spending. Some of the world’s top
spenders, such as Lesotho (7 percent of
GDP) and South Sudan (10 percent), are in
Sub-Saharan Africa; but so are many countries
that spend very little on SSN as a percentage
of GDP. Those include Cameroon, Republic
of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau,
Madagascar, São Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia,
and Togo, which spend less than 0.2 percent of
GDP on SSN.
In the Latin America and Caribbean region,
the mean SSN spending is 1.5 percent of GDP,
or 1.3 percent, excluding heath fee waivers. The
highest spender is Chile (3.5 percent of GDP),
whereas the median country spends 1.5 percent
of GDP (1.1 percent, excluding health fee waivers). Guatemala (0.19 percent of GDP) and

Social safety net spending
Social safety net spending without health fee waivers
Source: ASPIRE database.
Note: The number of countries in each region appears in parentheses. The difference in the regional average for Africa in this report as
opposed to the Africa regional report (Beegle, Coudouel, and Monsalve, forthcoming) is that in the regional report, average social safety net
spending (1.3 percent of GDP) does not include South Sudan as an outlier in terms of spending. The regional numbers presented in this figure
are simple averages across countries. See appendix B for details. The conceptual treatment of health fee waivers is not straightforward
because it depends on how countries arrange and report their provision of health care. Although in some cases the health fee waivers are
reported under public health expenditures, in other cases they are counted under social protection expenditures. ASPIRE = Atlas of Social
Protection: Indicators of Resilience and Equity.

St. Lucia (0.48 percent of GDP) are the lowest
SSN spenders (see appendix D).
The East Asia and Pacific region
spends on average 1 percent of GDP on SSN,
but significant variation in spending exists
across countries. SSN spending ranges from
0.2 percent of GDP in Lao PDR and 0.3 percent
in Myanmar to 2.0 percent in Mongolia and
6.5 percent in Timor-Leste (see appendix D).
Timor-Leste spends the most on SSN in the
region (figure 2.3). The median East Asia and
Pacific country spends 0.8 percent of GDP on
SSNs, or 0.7 percent, excluding health fee waivers (see table 2.1).
The median SSN spending across the globe
is 1.1 percent of GDP, or 1 percent, excluding
health fee waivers. The regions form two clusters in terms of median SSN spending. In Latin
America and the Caribbean and in Europe
and Central Asia, the median country spends
1.5–1.9 percent of GDP on SSN, whereas
in East Asia and Pacific, Middle East and

Spending on Social Safety Nets

North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan
Africa, the median country spends almost 1
percentage point less, around 0.7–0.8 percent
of GDP (see table 2.1).
Countries with very high SSN spending
­levels are often those that contend with fragility, conflict, and violence. For example, TimorLeste introduced a universal social pension
for war veterans in 2008 as a response to
­violent conflicts in the mid-2000s. In South
Sudan, as mentioned, all SSN spending consists of two large programs financed and
implemented by the World Food Programme.
These programs are in-kind and include
­multiple components, such as general food
­distributions, blanket supplementary feeding
programs, and targeted supplementary feeding programs for internally displaced persons
and returnees.
Another common explanation for the
observed high spending levels is the inclusion
of universal programs in the SSN portfolio in

the countries. For example, Georgia and
Lesotho are among the top spenders because
their SSN programs include a universal oldage minimum social pension. In Georgia,
spending of 4.6 percent of GDP on universal old-age pensions contributes more than
60 ­percent of total SSN spending. Lesotho
spends 2 percent of GDP on old-age social
pensions (see appendix D). Mongolia also
­
spends significantly more than the regional
average because of its universal child benefit,
called the Child Money Program, which
accounts for almost 80 percent of total SSN
spending.
DO HIGHER-INCOME COUNTRIES SPEND
MORE ON SOCIAL SAFETY NETS?
Globally, country income levels appear to
be weakly associated with SSN spending

as a ­
The data suggest that high-income countries,
at 1.9 percent of GDP, and upper-middle-­
income ­countries, at 1.6 percent of GDP, tend
to spend only somewhat more than lowermiddle-­
income countries, at 1.4 percent of
GDP, and low-­income countries, at 1.5 percent
of GDP. Looking at spending levels excluding
health fee waivers, the patterns appear to be
similar. Low-income, lower-middle-income,
and upper-middle-­income countries spend on
average between 1.3 and 1.5 percent of GDP,
whereas high-income countries spend on average 1.9 percent of GDP (see figure 2.5 and
table 2.2).
The analysis using individual country
observations suggests that there is no global
relationship between a country’s income level
and SSN spending as a percentage of GDP. In
the Latin America and the Caribbean region,
spending appears weakly, positively associated with income levels, whereas in other
regions, spending is either negatively associated with income levels or has no correlation
(­figure 2.6). Globally, it appears that countries
with the same GDP per capita levels choose
different levels of spending on SSNs reflecting
different policy preferences rather than economic conditions.
Globally, the median country spends
around US$80 (US$66, excluding health fee
waivers) in purchasing parity power (PPP)
terms annually per person (considering the
total population, not just beneficiaries), while
the mean country spends around US$157
(US$150, excluding health fee waivers). As a
complement to the relative spending analysis,
absolute annual (PPP US$) spending per capita can more accurately assess actual spending
on SSNs in a country. For example, in absolute terms per person annually, the Latin
America and the Caribbean countries spend
PPP US$158 (US$139, excluding health fee
waivers), whereas African countries spend
PPP US$16 (figures 2.7 and 2.8). Even though
the Africa region is the second-largest spending region in the world in relative terms (percentage of GDP), in absolute terms it is last
among the regions (figure 2.9).
The absolute benefit level per household also
differs significantly across country income
groups. In a subsample of 36 countries that

transfer amounts in low-income countries and
lower-middle-income countries do not differ
significantly (averaging about PPP US$30).
However, the median upper-middle-income
country provides more than three times the
median benefits of low-income countries and
lower-middle-­income countries (a little less
than PPP US$100), as figure 2.10 indicates.

Spending on Social Safety Nets

HOW HAS SPENDING CHANGED
OVER TIME?
In general, SSN spending fluctuates a lot over
time in some countries, while it remains relatively stable in others. This section largely focuses
on time trends in SSN spending in the Latin
America and the Caribbean and the Europe and
Central Asia regions because the other regions

25

lack consistent spending data for 10 years or
more. Hence, the findings reflect only these two
regions and do not represent global trends.
However, the expansion in coverage and spending is also illustrated for many large (flagship)
programs globally.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, social
spending as a percentage of GDP increased substantially over the past decade (2005–15). This
book analyzed a subsample of seven countries
in the region (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,
Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay) with balanced panel time-series spending on SSN. Their
total population represents about 75 percent of
the total Latin American and Caribbean population. The analysis suggests that in this group of
countries, average SSN spending increased from
0.43 to 1.26 percent of GDP from 2003 to 2015
(see figure 2.11). The increase in SSN spending
accelerated around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, despite a reduction in the rate of economic growth. Argentina and Peru show the
highest relative spending increases since 2009.
In Europe and Central Asia, the increase
in social spending over a similar period
was ­moderate. This book analyzed a subsample of 15 countries in the region (Albania,
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia,

Kazakhstan, Latvia, Macedonia, Montenegro,
Poland, Romania, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine)
with balanced panel time-series spending on
SSN.5 Their total population represents about
60 percent of the Europe and Central Asia
countries.6 The analysis suggests that in this
group of countries, average spending rose
steadily, from 1.2 to 1.8 percent of GDP
from 2003 to 2009, and then fell slightly, to
1.6 ­percent in 2014. Before the financial crisis, the region seems to have reached a
steady level of SSN spending; then spending grew in response to the financial crisis;
and now it is converging to the prior level (see
figure 2.12).
Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia
are introducing flagship SSN programs and are
rapidly expanding coverage. However, these initiatives come at a fiscal cost. In Tanzania,
the Productive Safety Net Program expanded
from 0.4 to 10 percent of the population from its
launch in 2013 to 2016 (figure 2.13, panel a). This
coverage expansion was accompanied by a rapid
increase in program spending, from 0.03 to almost
0.3 percent of GDP in two years. In Senegal, the
National Cash Transfer Program expanded from 3
to 16 percent of the population in four years
­(figure 2.13, panel b). The corresponding program

spending increased from 0.05 to 0.2 percent of
GDP during 2013–15. In Indonesia, the Program
Keluarga Harapan increased its coverage from 1 to
9 percent of the population between 2008 and
2016, and the respective budget also increased
­(figure 2.13, panel c). In the Philippines, the flagship conditional cash transfer program called 4Ps
increased its coverage from 4 to 20 percent of
the population between 2008 and 2015, and
the respective budget increased from 0.1 to
0.5 percent of GDP ­(figure 2.13, panel d). The
global inventory of the biggest SSN programs (by
category) per country can be found in appendix C.
WHICH SOCIAL SAFETY NET
INSTRUMENTS DO COUNTRIES FUND?
Beyond the heterogeneity in total spending,
countries and regions also differ in their preferences for various SSN instruments. The legacy
of SSNs, cultural differences, demographic conditions, the socioeconomic context, political
will, and other factors shape the structure of
countries’ SSN portfolios. Figure 2.14 maps the
distribution of SSN budgets across different
program types, by region.
The analysis suggests that cash transfers take
up more than half of all SSN spending. Europe

Spending on Social Safety Nets

and Central Asia has the largest cash transfer
budget share among regions (with cash transfers
consisting of unconditional and conditional cash
transfers and social pensions). Cash transfers in
Europe and Central Asia account for 76 percent
of the total SSN spending portfolio. At the same
time, the Middle East and North Africa countries, on average, allocate just over 40 percent of
their budget to cash transfers (see figure 2.14).
The Latin America and Caribbean region
has the largest conditional cash transfer budget
share. The region spends around 21 percent of its
total SSN budget on this instrument. However,
the Latin America and Caribbean region is not
alone in its substantial reliance on conditional
cash transfers. It is followed closely by SubSaharan Africa, where conditional cash transfers
account for around 18 percent of the SSN budget.
East Asia and Pacific spends 12 percent of GDP
on conditional cash transfers (figure 2.14).
The public works spending budget share is
the highest in South Asia, where this type of
program is commonly implemented. South
Asia spends 25 percent of its SSN budget on
public works. In South Asia, Bangladesh and
India spend the highest share (see
­appendix D). Sub-Saharan Africa spends on

27

average 12 percent of the SSN budget on public works. In Sub-Saharan Africa, Burundi,
Central African Republic, Ethiopia, and
Liberia spend the highest share of GDP on
public works (see appendix D).
In-kind transfers account for a significant
share of SSN spending in a number of regions.
These include Middle East and North Africa
(18 percent), Africa (11 percent), South Asia
(10 percent), and Latin America and the

Caribbean (9 percent). The spending on in-kind
transfers in the Middle East and North Africa is
driven by such countries and economies as West
Bank and Gaza and Djibouti, where emergency
and fragile context leads to in-kind interventions
(mostly donor funded). In Iraq, the spending on
food rations accounts for more than 85 percent
of the total SSN spending.7 In South Asia, India’s
Public Distribution System program costs more
than 1 percent of GDP (see appendix D) and

CHAPTER 3
Analyzing the Performance of Social
Safety Net Programs

T

his chapter analyzes the performance of
social safety net (SSN)/social assistance
(SA) programs using four indicators:
coverage, beneficiary incidence, level of benefits, and impact on poverty and inequality. To
set the stage, the first section of this chapter
presents an overview of the coverage of social
protection and labor (SPL) programs in
general that encompasses SSN/SA programs,
social insurance, and labor market programs.
Within this framework, this chapter then
­analyzes the role of SSN programs as a main
SPL instrument. Performance indicators provide answers to very important development
questions. Coverage indicates what percentage
of the total population or a specific population
group benefits from SSN programs. Among all
possible population groups, the poor have the
greatest need for social protection and are particularly the focus of SSNs aimed at assisting
the poor. Beneficiary incidence sheds light on
how the total number of beneficiaries are distributed along the welfare distribution of the
population. The level of benefits indicates
the proportion of the benefits with respect to
the household’s total income or consumption.
Impact on poverty and inequality shows the
reduction in the poverty headcount, poverty
gap, and inequality (as measured by the Gini
index) because of the SPL transfers.
The performance indicators presented in
this chapter represent only a first step at
­monitoring SSN program performance and do

not replace results from impact evaluations.
Performance indicators from household s­ urvey
data help monitor SSN programs’ performance
over time as information from household surveys becomes available. Given that significant
resources are being invested by governments in
the implementation of SSN programs, it is
important to continuously monitor the effectiveness of these programs and inform social
policy.
Performance indicators derived from
household surveys assess the effect of the
transfers on the welfare of beneficiaries (in
terms of income or consumption) and their
distributional effects. Impact evaluations, on
the other hand, are designed to measure a
broader specific set of outcomes, such as the
effects on beneficiaries’ level of consumption,
production, labor supply, human capital, and
risk management (see highlight 1 at the end
of this chapter). The effects attributed to the
program are evaluated by using a counterfactual to determine the potential outcomes for
the beneficiaries in the absence of the program. However, impact evaluations are not
conducted very frequently and are not available for all programs; accordingly, household
surveys play a crucial role in monitoring
­programs, given that they are systematically
conducted across years and may include a
larger set of programs for which impact evaluations are not available. Therefore, performance indicators from household surveys

and impact evaluations provide a complementary picture of what social protection
programs are achieving.
This chapter first presents evidence on coverage, then on beneficiary incidence, followed
by benefit size, and impacts on poverty and
inequality. In addition, a highlight focuses on
productive outcomes of SSN programs in
Sub-Saharan Africa based on impact evaluations. The analysis uses a subset of the most
recent household surveys (2008–16) from the
Atlas of Social Protection: Indicators of
Resilience and Equity (ASPIRE) database,
corresponding to 96 countries with information about SSN programs. The full sample of
countries is used for coverage and beneficiary
incidence indicators; however, for assessing
benefits level and impacts on poverty and
inequality, only 79 countries are used, for
which the monetary value of the transfers is
provided in the household surveys. This
­chapter also provides country-level key performance indicators of SPL programs in
appendix F.1 and key performance indicators
solely for SSN/SA programs in appendix F.2.
WHO IS COVERED BY SOCIAL
PROTECTION AND LABOR PROGRAMS?
Coverage is expressed as the percentage of the
population receiving a given type of SPL program. In this analysis, coverage includes direct
and indirect beneficiaries (all household members where at least one member receives a benefit). The analysis first presents the global picture
of SPL coverage by region and country income
group, and then zooms in on country-level
coverage rates by the type of SSN program.
In discussing the coverage of the poor, the poor
are defined as individuals who belong to the
bottom 20 percent of the welfare distribution
(in terms of household total income or consumption per capita). In all subsequent figures
and in appendix F, the pretransfer welfare indicator is used to rank households, except for the
indicator that expresses the social transfers as a
share of total beneficiary welfare, which includes
transfers.
The analysis reveals that SPL programs cover
on average 44 percent of the total population.
SPL programs cover more than half the population in East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central
Asia, Latin American and the Caribbean, and
32

Middle East North Africa (see figure 3.1).1 In
terms of coverage of the poorest, Europe and
Central Asia has the highest coverage of individuals in the poorest quintile (86 percent), followed by Latin American and the Caribbean
(76 percent). In all regions, a higher percentage
of the poorest quintile (compared to the total
population) is covered.
The coverage rates presented in the first
three figures (see figures 3.1–3.3) are particularly
high because they include all types of SPL programs, not only SSN/SA programs. In other
words, the figures include any type of social
insurance (old-age pension and other social
security), active and passive labor market programs, and SSNs (unconditional cash transfers
[UCTs], conditional cash transfers [CCTs], social
pensions, public works, fee waivers and targeted subsidies, school feeding, in-kind transfers, and other SA programs).2 In addition, other
methodological factors drive this high coverage.
Specifically, the calculation includes direct and
indirect beneficiaries, and the poorest quintile is
estimated using pre-­transfer welfare.
In a sample of countries capturing all country income groups, the average SPL coverage
rate of the poorest quintile is 56 percent.
The coverage of SPL programs is highly
­correlated with the countries’ level of income.
Figure 3.2 shows that high- and upper-­middleincome countries cover 97 percent and 77 percent of the poorest quintile, respectively. In
contrast, lower-middle- and low-income countries cover 54 and 19 percent of the poorest
quintile, respectively. These coverage figures
should be interpreted with caution because
coverage rates derived from household surveys
are likely to be underestimated.3 As a response
to observed coverage gaps for the poor, such
initiatives as universal social protection (USP)
have emerged (see box 3.1).
In terms of the coverage of the poor, low-­
income countries lag in all three areas of social
protection. Figure 3.3 shows that social
insurance programs are more prevalent in
high-income countries, covering 60 percent of
the poorest quintile; in contrast, in low-­income
countries only 2 percent of the poorest quintile
is covered by this program type. SSN/SA programs account for most SPL program coverage of the poor in all country income groups.
Yet, high-income countries report the highest

BOX 3.1 Universal Social Protection
The Universal Social Protection (USP) Initiative
was launched by the World Bank Group, the
International Labour Organisation, and other
bilateral and multilateral partners in September
2016 to support the Sustainable Development
Goal (SDG) agenda for social protection.a The
USP Initiative aims to join the efforts of the
international agencies, donors, and governments in providing social protection for all people in need. Access to adequate social protection
is central to ending poverty and boosting shared
prosperity. The poorest countries continue to
have enormous coverage/adequacy gaps, as
the empirical evidence presented in this book
clearly suggests.
Countries have many options and pathways
to achieve universal social protection. Some
countries have opted for an explicit universal coverage of specific population groups
(Botswana, Timor-Leste), whereas others have
used a more gradual and progressive approach
to building up coverage (Brazil, Thailand). Some
countries have the principles of universalism
(universal rights) embedded in their national
constitutions (Bolivia, South Africa), whereas
others have pursued those principles without
constitutional provisions (Swaziland, Uruguay).
Universal social protection is most commonly
started with (universal) old-age pensions (see
chapter 4), but some countries have opted

to make disability, maternity/paternity, and/
or child benefits universal (Argentina, Nepal).
There are publicly financed child benefit social
pensions for all (Mongolia, Namibia) and minimum pensions for those who do not have a
contributory pension, ensuring universality
(Azerbaijan, China). Some countries strategically use transfers for the poor and vulnerable
who could fall further behind (Brazil, Chile, Fiji,
and Georgia).
The implementation of the USP Framework
emphasizes both depth and breadth of coverage, or vertical and horizontal expansion. The
depth of coverage is defined as areas of protection and can include income security, access
to insurance and saving instruments, access to
essential health care services, and other social
services or levels of support (or adequacy).
Expansion in the vertical sense means providing more protection to the same covered
groups. In terms of horizontal expansion, there
are different population groups with respect
to the stage in the life cycle (children, working
age, and elderly) or level of income (poor, vulnerable, middle class, rich). The evidence suggests that countries tend to gradually expand
coverage both vertically and horizontally. The
degree of coverage of the poor is highly correlated with the degree of coverage of the general population.

coverage of the poor by SSN programs (76 percent), compared with only 18 percent in
low-income countries. Labor market programs
cover the poor at a rate of 2 percent in low-­
income countries and 8 percent in high-­
income countries.4 SSN programs therefore
play a pivotal role in achieving social protection coverage of the poor.5 The rest of this
chapter focuses on analyzing the performance
of SSN instruments in the countries included
in the ASPIRE database.
WHICH TYPES OF SOCIAL SAFETY NET
PROGRAMS COVER THE POOR?
Different countries focus on different SSN
instruments. There is no one-size-fits-all
approach to SSN/SA programs. These noncontributory programs address different issues

34

and target different population groups based
on needs and vulnerabilities. Countries generally adopt a combination of SSN/SA programs
based on their social policy objectives. This
section analyzes the extent to which different
SSN/SA programs cover individuals in the
poorest quintile. The analysis details the number of countries reporting each program typology in the 96 household surveys included in
the ASPIRE database and presents the coverage of the poor (direct and indirect beneficiaries) by these instruments.
To facilitate analysis and cross-country
­comparisons, the programs are grouped into
eight standard SSN categories. Therefore,
the coverage indicator corresponds to the
aggregated program category and not necessarily to an individual program. For example,

Note: The total number of countries per country income group included in the analysis appears in parentheses. Aggregated indicators are
calculated using simple averages of country-level coverage rates for social insurance, social assistance, and labor market programs, across
country income groups. Indicators do not count for overlap among programs types (people receiving more than one program); therefore,
the sum of percentages by type of program may add up to more than 100 percent. Coverage is determined as follows: (number of individuals
in the total population or poorest quintile who live in a household where at least one member receives the transfer)/(number of individuals
in the total population). This figure underestimates total social protection and labor coverage because household surveys do not include
all programs that exist in each country. The poorest quintile is calculated using per capita pretransfer welfare (income or consumption).

Latvia includes 10 programs under UCTs,
which embrace the means-tested Guaranteed
Minimal Income Allowance, together with
more universal child and family benefits. On
the other hand, Belize includes only one program, the social welfare transfer, under UCTs.
Complete documentation of the programs
that are included in each SSN category, per
country, is available in the ASPIRE online
portal.6 In the discussion that follows, coverage of the poor is presented by each SSN program category, illustrating different patterns
in the use of specific SSN interventions, the
degree of variation in coverage rates across
countries, and the benchmarking of country
results against global program averages.7
UCTs constitute some of the most popular
safety net tools and are included in most

household surveys in all regions. They cover 23
percent of the poorest quintile, on average. In
the ASPIRE database, UCT programs are
reported in the household surveys of 63 countries, compared with 103 countries where the
administrative data report having at least one
program in this category.8 The most UCTs are
found in the household surveys for Europe and
Central Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (20 and
17 countries, respectively). Figure 3.4 shows
the distribution of UCT programs covering
from 0.6 to almost 100 percent of the poorest
quintile. Among the programs that achieve
almost 100 percent coverage of the poor are
the Child Money Program in Mongolia,9 and
the social transfers in Malaysia (94 percent
coverage of the poor), which may reflect the
performance of the Bantuan Rakyat 1 Program,

the country’s flagship cash transfer program
for the poor.10 In Europe and Central Asia,
Russian Federation’s cash transfer programs show the largest coverage of the poor
(79 ­percent).
CCTs typically aim to reduce poverty and
increase human capital by requiring beneficiaries to comply with conditions such as school
attendance and health checkups. The average
coverage of the poorest quintile by CCTs in the
sample of surveys is 40 percent. Pioneered
by Brazil and Mexico in the late 1990s, CCTs
spread to other countries in the region and
worldwide. Yet, few household surveys ­outside of

Latin America and the Caribbean c­ apture CCT
information. Only 19 countries in ASPIRE
include information on CCT programs in their
household surveys (of which 16 are in Latin
America and the Caribbean), compared with
64 programs observed in the administrative
database. This instrument covers from 2.4 to 75
percent of the poor (see ­figure 3.5). Asignaciones
Familiares in Uruguay has the largest coverage of
the poor (75 percent), followed by Bonos Juancito

Program (4Ps) in the Philippines, which ­covers
60 percent of the poor (see figure 3.5), demonstrating its focus on ensuring c­overage of the
poorest.
For individuals who do not have access to
social insurance benefits, social pensions aim to
overcome loss of income because of old age, disability, or death of the bread winner. In the
sample of countries, social pensions cover, on
average, 20 percent of the poorest quintile.
Social pensions presented here include noncontributory disability and survivor pensions, and
thus represent a broader category than old-age
social pensions (featured in chapter 4). Only
36 countries in the ASPIRE household survey
database capture any form of social pensions,
compared with 75 countries in the administrative database. Most surveys with social pension information are found in Europe and
Central Asia (n = 13) and Latin America and
the Caribbean (n = 10). In the sample, social
pensions cover between 0.6 and 81 percent of
individuals in the poorest quintile (see figure 3.6).
Georgia has the highest coverage of the poorest quintile because of its universal old-age
social pensions. A few countries in Africa have
extensive coverage of the poorest quintile,
such as Mauritius (79 percent) and South
Africa (62 percent). In all these countries, formal social insurance has low coverage and
social pensions constitute the main form of
social protection for the elderly. Thailand’s
social pensions have high coverage of the lowest quintile (58 percent), also driven by providing support to the elderly and disabled, taking
into account their living arrangements within
extended families.11 On the opposite extreme,
some countries in Europe and Central Asia
have extended social insurance systems; therefore, social pensions cover only those who
do not benefit from social insurance, which
constitute rather narrow population groups.
Hence the coverage is low (Latvia, Montenegro,
Russian Federation, and Serbia).
Public works programs typically condition
the transfer on participating in a community
project/activity. Very few public works programs are captured in the sample of household
surveys, and their coverage of the poorest quintile is limited, at 11 percent. Public works are
implemented for many reasons, such as to provide employment of last resort or to ­mitigate
38

covariate and idiosyncratic shocks. Public
works programs include cash-, food-, and
inputs-for-work (Andrews et al. 2012). They are
more often implemented in Sub-Saharan Africa
and South Asia, although respective information/data are not often captured in household
surveys. Only 9 countries in ASPIRE have specific information about public works in the
household surveys, as compared with 96 countries in the administrative database. In these
countries, public works cover between 1 and 27
percent of the poorest quintile (figure 3.7); the
largest coverage rates are observed for the
MGNREG program in India (27 percent), a
flagship national social safety net program with
a history going back decades; and MASAF in
Malawi (21 percent), the social fund program
that has become the cornerstone of the national
SSN system.
Fee waivers and targeted subsidies typically subsidize services or provide access to
low-priced food staples to the poor. They are
common but generally provide limited coverage of the poorest quintile—13 percent, on
average, in the sample of countries. However,
because this category is not easily collected
by household surveys, this average is most
likely a considerable underestimate. Services
under this category usually relate to education, health, housing, transportation, or utilities. When a beneficiary is exempt from
payment for such services and the cost is
borne by the government program, such fee
waivers provide conditional support for the
targeted group using a specific service.12
Out of 82 countries with information on fee
waivers and targeted subsidies in the administrative database, only 22 are observed in the
household survey data. Among the regions,
Europe and Central Asia (n = 10 countries)
and Latin America and the Caribbean countries (n = 8 countries) capture this typology
of programs in the surveys most often. The
program covers between 0.4 and 56 percent
of the poor (see figure 3.8). Coverage rates for
targeted subsidies and fee waivers in Europe
and Central Asia tend to be smaller because
these programs focus only on a subset of the
poor, but tend to include several different
forms of benefits (for example, subsidized
housing; and fee waivers for kindergartens,
health care, public transportation).

School feeding programs provide meals to
students generally in poor and food-insecure
areas, with the aim of improving nutrition,
health, and educational outcomes. In the sample, these programs are found, on average, to

benefit a significant share of the poor—37 percent.
Even though school feeding is a common safety
net program, it is not always captured in household surveys. Of the 117 countries reporting

26 countries with this program are found in the
household survey data. Of these 26 countries,
15 are in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Figure 3.9 shows that coverage varies across
countries from 2.21 to 86 percent of the poor.
Such variation is more likely to reflect the differences in survey designs and efforts to capture
this form of benefit than real differences across
countries. The programs with the largest coverage of the poor, among the countries with
­adequate data, are in Botswana (86 percent),
Bolivia (73 percent), El Salvador (69 percent),
Nicaragua (67 percent), and Honduras and
Panama (66 percent).
In-kind transfers consist of food rations,
clothes, school supplies, shelter, fertilizers,
seeds, agricultural tools or animals, and building materials, among others. They are a very
common SSN instrument, and in the sample
cover, on average, 27 percent of the poorest
quintile. Their objectives are usually to provide
food security, improve nutrition, increase
agricultural productivity, and deliver emer­
gency relief. Forty-five countries in the
ASPIRE ­
household survey database capture

40

information on in-kind transfers (see ­figure
3.10), compared with 90 countries in the
administrative database. About one-third of
the surveys (14 out of 45) reporting in-kind
transfers are in countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa, where they typically consist of programs to promote agricultural productivity or emergency relief. However, programs
report larger coverage of the poor in Latin
America and the Caribbean and Middle East
and North Africa than in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Supplemental food programs for children, pregnant and nursing women, and the elderly are
common in Latin America and the Caribbean,
as well as school supplies and uniforms. In a few
countries, these programs cover a high percentage of the poor, including Peru (84 percent),
Ecuador (74 percent), and El Salvador and
Paraguay (70 percent). Coverage in Peru is particularly large because the in-kind category
encompasses seven in-kind programs captured
in the survey, including nutritional programs,
school supplies, uniforms, and shoes and laptops
to school children. In Middle East and North
Africa, in-kind transfers take the form of food

each quintile is presented. Another corresponding indicator is benefits incidence, which shows
the proportion of program benefits transferred

impact in terms of poverty reduction (Yemtsov
et al., forthcoming).
The beneficiary incidence analysis conducted by type of SSN instrument reveals that,
on average, all types of SSN programs tend to
be propoor or favor the poor and near-poor.
That is, a higher percentage of beneficiaries
belong to the first and second poorest quintiles. This is illustrated in figure 3.11, where
the lines representing each SSN instrument show a similar downward slope. CCTs
generally show a more propoor distribution
compared with the other SSN instruments,
which is not surprising because these programs typically target poor households.
Figure 3.11 shows that, among the observed
programs, 45 percent of CCT beneficiaries are
in the poorest quintile on average, while only
4 ­percent are in the richest quintile. Between
33 and 37 percent of beneficiaries of the other
SSN instruments, on average, belong to the

poorest quintile, which indicates that those
instruments are still propoor.
The analysis of beneficiary incidence by SSN
instrument across countries shows the presence of highly propoor programs in each program category. Figures 3.12 through 3.18
illustrate that despite wide variation in beneficiary distribution across countries, most of
them favor the poor and near-poor, with more
than 20 percent of the total beneficiaries
belonging to the poorest quintile. However, for
every SSN category, there are also examples of
programs that are proportionally distributed
or even favor the rich more than the poor and
the middle class. It is not always possible to
draw general conclusions about the distribution of beneficiaries and benefits of a specific
program without knowing detailed information on the program’s design, eligibility criteria,
and implementation. Some programs may not
be propoor by design; for example, they may

the general population (that is, in the case of
universal programs). Or their eligibility criteria
may be categorical (for example, in terms of
disability, ethnicity, and war victims) and not
means-tested. In those cases, beneficiaries
meeting the categorical requirements may not
belong to the poor.
UCTs are characterized by a wide range of
beneficiary incidence across countries, but
on average, 37 percent of UCT beneficiaries
belong to the poorest quintile and 23 to the

second-­poorest quintile (figure 3.12). One reason for this large variation of results across
countries is the fact that ASPIRE—in some
countries—aggregates many types of UCTs,
and the respective programs may have very
different objectives and eligibility criteria.

However, for other countries, this category
captures only one program, making it easier to
interpret the observed beneficiary incidence
results. Universal programs have an even
distribution. For instance, for the Child

America and the Caribbean (n = 9); Middle East and North Africa (n = 7); East Asia and Pacific (n = 6); and South Asia (n = 4). Unconditional

universal or poverty-targeted child and family allowances. They do not include social pensions or targeted subsidies in cash. Beneficiaries’

of all five quintiles is close to 20 percent (see
­figure 3.12). In contrast, the programs in
Kosovo and Montenegro are much more
focused on the poorest quintile, which accounts
for more than 70 percent of the total UCT beneficiaries.16 At the same time, in Uruguay, only
7 percent of the beneficiaries of Prima por

Hogar Constituido (Transfer for Constituted
Household) belong to the poorest quintile. This
program is provided only to public servants
who are married or have dependents whose
monthly gross salary is less than the sum of two
national minimum wages. This explains why
the program is not propoor by design.

In general, CCTS are, as has been mentioned
already, more propoor than other SSN program
types. Among all 19 CCT programs included in
the ASPIRE database, the average beneficiary
incidence is 45 percent for the poorest quintile
and 26 percent for the second-poorest quintile.
Panama’s conditional cash transfer program,
Red de Oportunidades, has an incidence of participants from the poorest quintile of 75 ­percent.
More than 65 percent of the beneficiaries of
Programa Juntos in Peru, belong to the poorest
20 percent. Timor-Leste’s Bolsa da Mae has the
lowest beneficiary incidence rate for the poorest
quintile, at 21 percent (see figure 3.13).
Social pensions also have a very propoor distribution of beneficiaries. An average of
35 percent of beneficiaries belong to the p
­ oorest
quintile and 22 percent to the second-­poorest

quintile. The State Social Maintenance Benefit
in Latvia has the highest proportion of beneficiaries belonging to the poorest quintile (59
percent). In contrast, Programa Adulto Mayor
in Guatemala and Bono por Tercera Edad in
Honduras have only 8 and 9 percent of their
beneficiaries coming from the poorest quintile,
respectively (see figure 3.14). Part of the
propoor performance shown by some countries may be related to the way the p
­ retransfer
indicator is constructed. If social pensions
cover a sizable part of the poor and their benefit level is high, most beneficiaries may tend to
depend on them and hence group in the lowest
quintile of the welfare distribution once such
transfers are removed. On the other hand,
social pensions in Honduras tend to cluster
further up the income distribution, reflecting

capture of the program by the not so poor.
Mexico’s Programa de Empleo Temporal shows
the most propoor distribution, with 49 percent
of beneficiaries coming from the poorest quintile (see ­figure 3.15).
Fee waivers and targeted subsidies have a
somewhat flatter beneficiary incidence along the
welfare distribution, compared with other
instruments. On average, 33 percent of their
beneficiaries belong to the poorest quintile
and 24 percent to the second-poorest quintile.
In Panama, most of the beneficiaries (82 percent) of food supplements and agricultural subsidies belong to the poorest quintile, followed
by Vietnam, where nearly three-quarters
(73 percent) of beneficiaries of housing, petroleum, and kerosene subsidies and tuition fee
exceptions are in the poorest quintile. In South
Africa, by contrast, the rich capture most of
these benefits (see figure 3.16).
Beneficiary incidence of school feeding programs varies substantially by country. On average, 34 percent of beneficiaries of school feeding
programs belong to the poorest quintile and
24 percent to the second-­poorest quintile (see
­figure 3.17). The most propoor programs are
found in the Slovak Republic and Latvia, where

82 and 73 percent of the beneficiaries are drawn
from the poorest quintile, respectively. All these
programs are rather narrow in coverage, and
stand out from a typical universal school feeding
program, with different objectives that are often
not focused on alleviating poverty. In addition,
in universal programs with high coverage, the
incidence of school feeding will depend on the
access to schooling across quintiles, which may
be skewed in favor of the nonpoor, and is not a
design feature of the program itself.
In-kind transfers are generally quite
propoor. In the sample of observed programs,
34 percent of beneficiaries of in-kind transfers
belong to the poorest quintile and 23 percent
to the second-poorest quintile. Food aid in
Djibouti and food and nutritional programs in
Uruguay have especially propoor distributions, with 71 and 70 percent of the recipients
belonging to the poorest quintile, respectively
(see figure 3.18).17
WHAT ARE THE BENEFIT LEVELS OF

capita household income or consumption (adequacy ratio).18 The per-capita average transfer is
an absolute measure of benefit size and can
be compared with social minimums, such as
the poverty line or minimum wage. Benefits as
a share of household welfare (income or
­consumption), on the other hand, are a relative
measure that allows the importance of the
transfers in proportion to household per capita
welfare to be assessed.
The level of benefits is set to achieve program
objectives within budget constraints. There are
no standard rules to set benefits levels, given that
they need to be calibrated to fulfill program objectives and meet budget constraints. Contributory
old-age pensions, for example, are based on the
amount of contributions individuals make
during their active working life. In poverty reduction programs, the size of the transfers may be
calibrated to reduce the poverty gap of the target
population; programs that aim to address food
security will set their benefits to meet nutritional
needs.19 For example, Kenya’s Hunger Safety Net
50

Program sets transfer levels based on the fiveyear average price of cereals, whereas Zambia’s
Social Cash Transfer Program sets its benefits
close to the price of a 50-pound bag of maize
(corn) monthly, which would allow a household
to eat a second meal each day (Schüring 2010;
Garcia and Moore 2012).
The size of the benefit is a determining factor
to achieve positive impacts on household
well-being. The way program administrators set
benefit levels varies across countries; some programs use flat benefits, whereas others adjust
benefits based on household size, number of
dependents, and so forth. Flat benefits raise the
issue that the per capita transfer will decrease
with household size and program impacts will
vary across beneficiary households. Inflation is
another factor that can erode the real value of
the transfers over time, unless regular adjustment mechanisms are applied. In Kenya’s Cash
Transfer Program for Orphans and Vulnerable
Children, for example, the value of the transfer
decreased by almost 60 percent because of

(n = 5); Europe and Central Asia (n = 3); Middle East and North Africa (n = 1); East Asia and Pacific (n = 1); and South Asia (n = 1). School

inflation between 2007 to 2011 (Daidone et al.
2016). Therefore, having flexibility to adjust
benefit levels is important to maximize positive
impacts on household well-being, granted there
is budget space to do so.
How large should a transfer be to achieve
meaningful impacts? The higher the share of
the transfers with respect to household welfare,
the greater the impacts on poverty and inequality are likely to be.20 Given budget constraints,
however, larger transfers may imply fewer
beneficiaries. There are concerns that larger
transfer values can create disincentives to work.
However, most impact evaluations have found
that transfers in general do not reduce labor
supply, but they do influence the allocation of
labor and time. Therefore, determining the size
of the transfers is usually a delicate balance

between the benefit amount needed to achieve
objectives, needs for program coverage, and
the available budget. Given these considerations, the evidence gathered from impact
evaluations suggests that most successful cash
transfers programs, for example, transfer at
least 20 ­percent of household consumption to
beneficiaries (Handa et al. 2013).
Empirical analysis indicates that the benefit
level expressed as a share of beneficiary welfare
among recipients varies greatly across SPL
areas. Figures 3.19 and 3.20 show that on average the benefit level for social insurance programs is greater than the benefit level for SSN
programs. This is expected because social insurance programs are designed to replace beneficiaries’ working earnings. The global average
for social insurance programs as a share of

it is 11 percent (see figure 3.19). The relatively
high level of SSN benefits for low-­
income
countries could also reflect the fact that many
of the SSN programs in those countries are
donor/externally funded. However, the available data do not make it possible to test this
hypothesis.
SPL transfers make up a significant proportion of the welfare of individuals in the poorest
quintile. For the surveys included in ASPIRE,
the average share of the transfers in the welfare of
the poorest quintile is 46 percent for social insurance and 19 percent for SSNs (see figure 3.20),
compared with 32 and 10 percent observed in
the total population (see figures 3.19). For the

poor, the share of social insurance benefits is
still higher than the share of SSNs, but there is
not a clear correlation between the magnitude of
this share and country income groups. For
example, social insurance makes up 48 percent
of beneficiary welfare in low- and upper-­middleincome countries, higher than the share observed
for lower-middle-income countries (39 percent).
Likewise, SSN programs make up 22 percent
of beneficiary welfare in upper-middle-income
countries, which is higher than the share
in ­lower-middle- and high-income countries
(18 percent) (see figure 3.20).
On average, SSN transfers account for
19 ­percent of the welfare of the poorest quintile.
However, transfer levels vary greatly across SSN
instruments and across countries. These differences reflect, in part, different program objectives and the degree of transfer values captured

Note: The number of countries per country income group with monetary values for social assistance is as follows: total (n = 79), high-income
countries (n = 5), upper-middle-income countries (n = 30), lower-middle-income countries (n = 30), and low-income countries (n = 14).
The number of countries with monetary values for social insurance is as follows: total (n = 79), high-income countries (n = 6), upper-middleincome countries (n = 28), lower-middle-income countries (n = 29), and low-income countries (n = 16). Transfers as a share of a beneficiary’s
welfare can be generated only if monetary values are recorded in the household survey; for this reason, the sample of countries used in this
figure is smaller than the one used to estimate coverage and beneficiary incidence. Labor market programs were not included because they
encompass mostly active labor market programs for which only participatory variables (vs. monetary) are observed in the surveys. The sample
of countries that include monetary variables (mostly for unemployment insurance) is too small to derive any meaningful conclusion (n = 18).
The share of transfers is determined as follows: (transfer amount received by all direct and indirect beneficiaries in a population group)/(total
welfare aggregate of the direct and indirect beneficiaries in that population group). Aggregated indicators are calculated using simple averages
of country-level social assistance and social insurance transfers’ shares, across country income groups. The poorest quintile is calculated using

in household surveys. Figures 3.21 to 3.25 illustrate the proportion of SSN benefits with respect
to beneficiary welfare by type of SSN instrument and by country.22 Social pensions and
CCTs tend to make up, on average, a higher
proportion of beneficiary welfare—while the
share is much lower for public works, fee waivers, and targeted subsidies. However, this indicator varies greatly across countries within each
SSN instrument.
On average, UCT transfers as a share of beneficiary welfare for the poorest quintile amount
to 19 percent. To estimate this indicator, 52 surveys with monetary values were used out of 63
surveys with UCT information and out of a
total of 79 surveys with monetary data for SSNs
(see figure 3.21). As mentioned, in the case of
UCTs, this indicator could be imprecise because
54

various cash transfers implemented with different objectives may be aggregated: for example,
poverty alleviation programs and universal
family allowances. However, in a few countries,
a single program is included in the UCT typology; thus, results can be attributed to that particular program.
Some UCT programs with a poverty alleviation objective tend to have a higher benefit level.
For example, UCT programs make up the largest
share of the welfare of the poor (49 ­percent) in
Georgia and Rwanda (­figure 3.21). Several programs are aggregated into the UCT categories
for Georgia, but the results are mainly driven
by the Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) program.23 In the case of Rwanda, the result corresponds to the Direct Support from the
Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme (VUP),

programs; guaranteed minimum-income programs; and universal or poverty-targeted child and family allowances. They do not include
social pensions or targeted subsidies in cash. Transfers as a share of a beneficiary’s welfare can be generated only if monetary values

­survey. On the other side of the spectrum,
very little can be ascertained about Sudan,
where the household survey includes only a
single question about general government
assistance, without specifying what type of
assistance it may be.
On average, CCTs account for a 16 percent
share of the beneficiary welfare of the poor.
Only 17 of 21 surveys with CCT information
include a transfer value in the household survey
that could be used to calculate this indicator.
Bolivia’s Bono Juancito Pinto and Bono Juana
Azurduy, combined, make up the largest share
of the beneficiary welfare (36 percent) and
Honduras’ Bonos PRAF is second (32 p
­ ercent).
The combined share of CCTs aggregated for
Bangladesh is only 2.2 percent, the lowest of
all included countries (see figure 3.22).

Social pensions make up a higher proportion
of the welfare of the poor compared with other
SSN instruments: 27 percent, on average. This
finding is expected because somewhat like contributory pensions, social pensions are designed
to address the lack of earnings because of old
age and disability. Of 37 surveys with social
pension information, only 30 include transfer
values that make it possible to calculate the
indicator. As shown in figure 3.23, the noncontributory old-age pension, disability grants,
and the war veterans pension in South Africa
combined make up the largest proportion of
beneficiary welfare of the included countries
(77 percent), and Brazil’s Benefício de Prestação
Continuada follows (66 percent).
Public works programs have one of the lowest shares among SSN programs with respect to
beneficiary welfare of the poorest quintile

(7 percent). However, little can be concluded
from the public works average indicator
because only 4 out of 10 surveys with public
works information include monetary values
(see ­figure 3.24). This indicator cannot be estimated for some flagship public works programs (for example, the Productive Safety Net
Program in Ethiopia or MGNREG in India),

because they do not have monetary values in
household surveys.
Fee waivers and targeted subsidies have the
lowest share of beneficiary welfare among SSN
programs: 6.7 percent, on average—much lower
than the SSN global average of 19 percent (see

because fee waivers and targeted subsidies

included under this category are typically
aimed at helping the poor offset the cost of
some services rather than support main earnings. In addition, the values captured in surveys
and used to build this indicator are only a subset of this type of benefits: merely subsidies
paid in cash. Many of these benefits are, by
design, in the form of fee waivers, and thus
monetary values are not available in the surveys. This indicator was calculated using only
12 out of 24 surveys with fee waivers and targeted subsidy information.
WHAT ARE THE POVERTY AND
INEQUALITY IMPACTS OF SOCIAL
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS?
This section provides an analysis of the ability of
SSN monetary transfers to reduce poverty and

inequality. The reduction in poverty and
inequality is simulated by comparing beneficiaries’ welfare recorded in the survey before and
after SSN transfers. Using information from
surveys, the analysis computes what household
per capita income or consumption would be
without SSN transfers (see box 3.2). In other
words, the transfer value is subtracted from the
observed welfare (posttransfer welfare) to determine who would fall into poverty (using the
absolute or relative poverty lines) if the transfer
is eliminated (pretransfer welfare). The proportion of individuals who are lifted out of poverty
as a direct effect of the transfer is estimated and
illustrated in figure 3.26, along with the poverty
gap reduction.24
On the basis of the information observed in
household surveys, the analysis shows that SSN

BOX 3.2 Measuring the Impact of Social Protection and Labor Programs
Household surveys provide a unique opportunity to measure the impact of the social protection and labor (SPL) programs on poverty or
inequality because they contain information on
the household aggregated income or consumption (welfare). This information makes it possible
to determine, in each country, who the poor are.
To allow international comparability, the Atlas of
Social Protection: Indicators of Resilience and
Equity (ASPIRE) database adopts two measures
of poverty: the international absolute poverty
line of US$1.90 a day per capita in purchasing
power parity (PPP) terms; and a relative poverty
line set at the bottom 20 percent of the pretransfer welfare distribution.
This chapter measures impacts on poverty
and inequality by comparing households’ per
capita welfare before and after the transfers.
For example, assume that the threshold for
the bottom 20 percent in a given country is
US$2.50 PPP per capita per day. The survey
reports that a household has a per capita
income (or consumption) of US$3.00 PPP a day,
which includes a transfer of US$1.00 PPP a day.
The US$3.00 PPP welfare level constitutes the
posttransfer welfare for that household. Then
the analysis subtracts the transfer from that
welfare (3.00 − 1.00 = 2.00). The US$2.00 PPP a
day amount constitutes the pretransfer welfare.
Because US$2.00 is lower than the quintile
threshold of US$2.50, it can be determined that
this household was lifted out of poverty thanks

to the transfers. By replicating this calculation for
the universe of households/individuals receiving
transfers and applying the population expansion
factors, the book is able to estimate the direct
poverty and inequality reduction rates from the
transfers for any given country.
This chapter uses three indicators to measure
impacts on poverty and inequality: poverty
headcount, poverty gap, and inequality reductions
(in percent or relative terms). Poverty headcount
provides the number of people living under the
poverty line in a given country. The poverty
headcount reduction is the percentage reduction
in poverty because of the transfer. However, not
all program beneficiaries become nonpoor after
receiving a transfer; this depends on their position
under the poverty line and if the transfer helped
the beneficiary reach or surpass the poverty
line. For those who do not overcome poverty, the
simple headcount does not provide information
on how much “less poor” beneficiaries are after
the transfer. For this reason, the poverty gap is
an important indicator to estimate the depth of
poverty or how far below, on average, the welfare
of poor individuals is from the poverty line. The
poverty gap reduction thus provides information
on the ability of SPL programs to bridge this
gap. The Gini coefficient measures the inequality
among values of the welfare distribution.
Inequality reduction thus provides the percentage
reduction in the Gini index because of the SPL
transfer (Yemtsov et al., forthcoming).

transfers are making a substantial contribution
in the fight against poverty. Whether an absolute poverty line (measured as US$1.90 per capita per day in purchasing power parity [PPP]
terms) or a relative poverty line (measured in
terms of the poorest 20 percent) is used, the
analysis suggests that individuals are escaping
poverty or decreasing their depth of poverty
because of the SSN transfers.25 For the 79 countries that have monetary information, transfers
reduce the incidence of absolute p
­overty
(US$1.90 PPP per day) by 36 percent, whereas
relative poverty (the bottom 20 ­
percent) is
reduced by 8 percent (see figure 3.26).
On average, SSN transfers are reducing the
poverty gap more than the poverty headcount.
In other words, even if SSN transfers are not
lifting the poor and near-poor above the poverty line, they significantly reduce the poverty
gap. As shown in figure 3.26, SSN transfers
reduce the absolute poverty gap by 45 percent
and the relative poverty gap by 16 percent.

These results are remarkable considering that
these figures are underestimated because household surveys do not capture the whole universe
of SSN programs implemented in those countries. Therefore, it can be inferred that the real
impacts are likely to be even larger.
The reductions in the poverty headcount,
poverty gap, and inequality by SSN transfers
are observed in all country income groups.
In the sample of 79 surveys, the relative poverty headcount is reduced by 8 percent, the
­poverty gap by 16 percent, and the Gini inequality index by 2 percent (see figure 3.27). Across
country income groups, the average reduction in relative poverty headcount is only
2 ­percent in low-­income countries, 7 percent in
lower-middle-­­income countries, 11 percent in
upper-middle-income countries, and 15 percent in high-income countries. In terms of
the poverty gap, the average reduction is 3 percent for low-income countries, 14 percent for
lower-­middle-income countries, 21 percent for

Europe and Central Asia (n = 20); Latin America and the Caribbean (n = 16); East Asia and Pacific (n = 10); Middle East and North Africa (n = 6);
and South Asia (n = 4). This figure uses a relative measure of poverty defined as the poorest 20 percent of the welfare distribution (income or
consumption) and absolute measure of poverty defined as US$1.90 PPP per day. Impacts on poverty and inequality can be estimated only if
monetary values are recorded in the household survey; for this reason, the sample of countries used in this figure is smaller than the one used
to estimate coverage and beneficiary incidence. Percentages of poverty and inequality reduction are calculated as follows: (poverty headcount
pre-transfer – poverty headcount posttransfer)/(poverty headcount pretransfer). Same calculations apply for poverty gap percentage reductions.
Aggregated indicators are calculated using simple averages of country-level percentage reductions of the indicator across country income groups.
The reductions in poverty are underestimated because ASPIRE does not include data for every single country in the country income groups, and
even for a given country the survey does not include all existing social safety net programs or provide monetary values for them. For example,
India and the impact of its flagship program MNREGA are not included in the calculation because only participatory information is available for
the program. ASPIRE = Atlas of Social Protection: Indicators of Resilience and Equity; PPP = purchasing power parity.

The same calculations apply for the Gini index and poverty gap percentage reductions. Aggregated indicators are calculated using simple

upper-middle-­income countries, and 30 percent
for high-­income countries. The Gini inequality
index is less affected by SSN transfers, but
reductions are still observed, ranging from
0.2 percent in low-­income countries to 5 percent
in high-­income countries.
The lower reduction in poverty and inequality
observed for low-income countries is likely
driven by several factors. First, fewer low-­income
countries have recent household survey data
available compared with other country income
groups. Second, of the 22 low-income country
surveys included in ASPIRE, only 14 surveys
include monetary variables for SSN programs.
Third, many low-income country surveys neither capture SSN-specific program information
nor include the universe of programs that exist
in the country. And fourth, less than 10 percent
of the global population live in low-income
countries; therefore, the number of individuals moving out of poverty (in percent terms) is

lower than in other country income groups.26

The extent to which SSN transfers have an impact
on poverty and inequality depends on factors
such as program coverage, transfer level, and the
beneficiary/benefit incidence. Policy makers
need to pay attention to the interaction of these
factors when designing policies to reduce poverty/inequality. Figures 3.28 and 3.29 explore the
reductions in poverty and inequality achieved by
each country, given their degree of coverage of
the poor and benefits levels.
The analysis reveals, in general, that very
high coverage levels paired with high benefit
­levels lead to higher outcomes in poverty and
inequality reduction. For example, Georgia and

South Africa display the highest poverty headcount reduction using the poorest quintile as
the poverty measure (see figure 3.28). Georgia’s
combination of high SSN coverage (93 percent
of the poorest quintile) and high level of benefits (SSN transfers constitute 68 percent of the
poor’s welfare) leads to the highest poverty
headcount reduction, nearly 43 percent. The
universal old-age social pension drives these
results because it covers 81 percent of the poorest quintile and constitutes 56 percent of their
total welfare. The five programs included under
cash transfers programs for Georgia—­including
the Targeted Social Assistance program—also
cover a high percentage of the poorest quintile
(46 percent) and make up 49 percent of the
beneficiary welfare. Likewise, South Africa also
shows high coverage and benefit levels for the
poor (96 and 72 percent, respectively), leading
to a poverty headcount reduction of 40 percent.
In the South African survey, family and other

allowances are among the SSN benefits with
high coverage of the poor; however, social pensions constitute higher shares of beneficiary
welfare. In both countries, the cost of SSN
programs expressed as a percentage of GDP is
rather large (7 percent for Georgia and
3.3 percent for South Africa).
Conversely, very low coverage levels paired
with low levels of benefits lead to negligible
results in reducing poverty and inequality. For
example, figure 3.28 shows how Armenia, with a
combination of lower SSN coverage of the poor
and benefits level (46 and 32 percent, respectively), achieves a more modest reduction in the
poverty headcount (12 percent). SSNs in Liberia,
with a much more modest combination of coverage of the poor and ­
benefit level (10 and
17 percent, respectively), achieve a small ­poverty
headcount reduction (2.5 percent). The estimated
poverty headcount reduction for Chad is almost
negligible (0.1 percent) because scholarships are

Note: The number of countries with monetary values for social safety nets is as follows: world (n = 79), high-income countries (n = 5), uppermiddle-income countries (n = 30), lower-middle-income countries (n = 30), and low-income countries (n = 14). This figure uses a relative
measure of poverty defined as the poorest 20 percent of the welfare distribution (income or consumption). Poverty headcount reductions
can be estimated only if monetary values are recorded in the household survey; for this reason, the sample of countries used in this figure
is smaller than the one used to estimate coverage and beneficiary incidence. Percentages of poverty headcount reduction are calculated as
follows: (poverty headcount pretransfer – poverty headcount posttransfer)/(poverty headcount pretransfer). Poverty headcount reductions
are underestimated because ASPIRE does not include data for every single country in the country income groups, and even for a given
country the survey may not include all existing social safety net programs or provide monetary values for those programs. ASPIRE = Atlas

the only SSN program captured in the survey.
These scholarships have very low coverage of the
poor (0.2 percent), although their contribution
to beneficiary welfare is 23 percent.
In terms of the poverty gap reduction, the
same interplay between coverage and benefit
size is observed. In third place behind
Georgia and South Africa, Mauritius also
shows high coverage and benefit levels for the
poorest quintile (84 percent and 55 percent,
respectively), leading to a poverty gap reduction
of 61 percent. The survey includes monetary
information for eight programs, of which the
noncontributory basic retirement pension has
the highest coverage of the poor. Mauritius also
reports high social spending according the
administrative database (3.5 percent of GDP).
In Poland, SSN programs captured in the household surveys report a relatively high level of coverage of the poor (65 percent), but the transfer
as a share of beneficiary welfare is smaller

(27 percent), producing a more modest estimated poverty gap reduction (42 percent). In
Montenegro, SSN programs provide modest
coverage of the poor (25 percent) and represent a modest share of beneficiary welfare
(28 percent); thus, Montenegro achieves a modest poverty gap reduction (23 percent). In the
Maldives, the household survey includes only
two SSN programs: unspecified government
transfers and social pensions. Even though
social pensions have a high benefit level, driving
the Maldives’ SSN average benefit to 76 percent
of the beneficiary welfare, the coverage of both
types of programs is small (15 percent) and thus
the poverty gap reduction is modest (28 percent). In Burkina Faso, the poverty gap reduction is 0.1 percent, mostly because the survey
does not capture a monetary value for government transfers, meaning that the estimation
rests only on information on scholarships and
other general transfers (figure 3.29).

NOTES

1. SPL programs encompass social safety nets/social
assistance, social insurance, and labor market
programs.
2. For example, the household survey for El Salvador
includes programs under the three areas of SPL. In
this case, even though the most iconic programs in
the country such as the CCT and social pensions are
not adequately captured in the household survey, the
in-kind transfers programs as well as the school feeding program drive the coverage of SSN programs up
to 53 percent of the total population and 72 percent
of the poorest quintile.
3. A source of potential bias is the fact that household
surveys do not collect information from all social
protection programs implemented in a country, but
big flagship programs are likely to be captured.
4. A factor influencing this low coverage is that very little information on labor market interventions is captured in most household income and expenditure
surveys; thus, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions regarding this program type.
5. The terms “social safety nets” and “social assistance”
are used interchangeably in this book.

6. See http://datatopics.worldbank.org/aspire/~​
/­documentation.
7. Aggregated variables with too few observations
(less than 0.5 percent of the survey sample) were
excluded because they are not representative to derive
meaningful results. For example, the Livelihood
Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), Ghana’s
UCT program, was excluded under this criterion.
8. Under ASPIRE, UCTs encompass interventions such
as poverty alleviation or emergency programs, guaranteed minimum-income programs, and universal
or poverty-targeted child and family allowances;
UCTs do not include social pensions, public works,
or targeted subsidies paid in cash.
9. The Child Money Program was introduced in
Mongolia as a targeted program in 2005 and became
universal in July of 2006. Although the program was
discontinued temporarily, it was reintroduced in
October 2012, with a benefit level of US$14.72 per
month per child (Yeung and Howes 2015).
10. The BR1M program was launched in 2012 to p
­ rovide a
single transfer to the poor. Households earning below
RM3,000 monthly receive RM1,200; households earning between RM3,001 amd RM4,000 monthly receive
RM900; and single individuals, 21 years and older,
earning less than RM2,000 per month, receive RM450
(BR1M’s ­official website: https://ebr1m.hasil.gov.my).
The Malaysian Household Income Survey does not
identify the name of the cash transfer program in
the questionnaire. However, it is likely capturing the
BR1M program.

11. In many countries, elderly people tend to live within
larger extended multigenerational families, whose
members benefit indirectly from social pensions.
Moreover, these pensions provide sizable benefits,
and because the measure of welfare used in this book
is pretransfer, many of the recipient families of social
pensions tend to concentrate in the lowest quintile
once this benefit is subtracted. This helps explain the
high coverage of all the poor by social pensions in
some countries featured in figure 3.6.
12. For this analysis, universal health schemes and universal general price subsidies are not included (most
fuel subsidies or price support schemes for food are
excluded). Instead, for commodities, only those subsidies that are targeted to specific individuals and
families are included. One form of targeted subsidy is
a lifeline (lower) tariff for a limited quantity of electricity, which is available only for eligible groups (as
in Albania or the Russian Federation).
13. The Rastra Program, formerly called Beras untuk
Rakyat Miskin (Raskin), is a rice subsidy introduced
in 1998 as an emergency food security program.
It delivers rice for purchase at subsidized prices and
prioritizes poor and near-poor households (World
Bank 2012). Even though the program reports the
highest coverage of the poor, the benefit has been
diluted to 4 kg per household on average from the
promised 15 kg. In light of this, the government is
proceeding with significant reforms.
14. Benefits incidence is not included in this analysis
because information on the transfer value is needed
to estimate it. Because not all the surveys include the
monetary value of the transfers, the report prefers to
use a larger sample of surveys by analyzing only the
distribution of beneficiaries. If the value of the transfers is similar across beneficiaries, the distribution of
beneficiaries and benefit across income groups will
be similar.
15. Whether a program is propoor can be determined
by the Coady-Grosh-Hoddinott (CGH) indicator,
which divides the share of the beneficiaries/benefits
belonging to a certain population group (for example, the bottom 20 percent) by the population share
of this group. If the result is higher than 1, the program is considered progressive toward this group.
For instance, if the bottom 20 percent of the population accounts for 40 percent of beneficiaries, this
indicator will be equal to 2, indicating that the program focuses on the poor. In the case of a universal
program where benefits are equally distributed, the
CGH indicator will be 1.
16. It is particularly interesting to observe that some
­programs with similar design features and institutional
structures—such as the Family Material Support (MOP)
and Family Allowances Program in Montenegro
and Serbia, which have the same legacy of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, and preserve some core

The State of Social Safety Nets 2018

features—have quite different distributions of beneficiaries. That implies that implementation matters a lot
in how well the program is capable of targeting the
poor.
17. In the case of Djibouti, these food distribution programs focus on rural areas where over half the population lives in poverty, according to the survey.
18. Transfers as a share of beneficiaries’ welfare is estimated as the amount of transfers received by a quintile divided by the total income or consumption of
beneficiaries in that quintile.
19. The poverty gap is the distance below the poverty line
and the average income of the poor. It is typically
expressed as the percentage shortfall in income of the
poor with respect to the poverty line.
20. At the same time, the greater is the concern about
potential disincentives to work.
21. To assess benefit levels, information on the actual value
of the transfers is needed. Therefore, only 79 out of 96
surveys available in ASPIRE were analyzed because
not all surveys include monetary information.
22. This analysis was done only for the types of ­programs
that involve a monetary transfer. Thus, the indicator
was not calculated for school feeding programs nor
for in-kind transfers. The sample of countries is also
different per SSN instrument, compared with the
sample used for coverage and beneficiary incidence,
depending on the availability of data about the transfer value in the survey for each of the SSN instruments
analyzed.
23. These programs are Internally Displaced Persons
Assistance, social assistance to multichildren families, social assistance to orphans, social assistance
to children with disabilities, and Targeted Social
Assistance (TSA).
24. Therefore, this is a first-level approximation of the
direct impact of the monetary transfers observed in the
surveys. It also does not assess any medium- or longterm effects of SSN transfers on their specific objectives,
which are better measured by impact evaluations.
25. The absolute poverty line of US$1.90 PPP a day may
not constitute a meaningful standard for many high-­
income countries that have a very small population,
or may not even have anybody living under that
threshold. In fact, countries such as Belarus, Croatia,
Lithuania, Montenegro, and Romania are able to fully
eradicate their poverty headcount at US$1.90 PPP a
day, according to information provided by household
surveys (see appendix F).

26. There are 3 billion people living in lower-middle-­
income countries and only 659 million in low-­
income countries. In lower-middle-income countries,
500 million people live below the US$1.90 PPP a day
threshold, which is more than 75 percent of the total
population of low-income countries. In India alone,
285 million people are living on less than US$1.90
PPP a day, as well as 120 million in Nigeria, and 49
million in China. In other words, most of the world’s
poor live outside low-income countries.

HIGHLIGHT 1: Productive Outcomes of Social Safety Net Programs:
Evidence from Impact Evaluations in Sub-Saharan Africa

A

defining characteristic of the poor in SubSaharan Africa is they are trapped in
low-­productivity or low-paying jobs. An
analysis using a sample of 28 low-income-country
household surveys from the Atlas of Social
Protection: Indicators of Resilience and Equity
(ASPIRE) found that 73 percent of individuals in
the poorest 20 percent are employed, of which 69
percent work in agriculture.1 Of those employed,
49 percent are self-employed, whereas 30 ­percent
are unpaid workers. Furthermore, many of the
poor live in a context of poorly functioning or
nonexistent labor and insurance/credit markets
that affect household economic decisions (Handa
et al. 2017). In this context, cash transfers may
help households overcome these market ­failures
and may enable them to spend more and to make
productive investments. This in turn may generate household-level multiplier effects (Daidone
et al. 2016), as well as spillover and income multiplier effects in local communities (Daidone et al.
2015; Thome et al. 2016).
This highlight summarizes new research on the
broader impacts of unconditional cash transfers,
particularly regarding economic impacts and
productive inclusion in the context of SubSaharan Africa. The discussion draws largely on
papers that synthesize and analyze the results
from evaluations in eight Sub-Saharan African
countries as part of The Transfer Project2 and the
From Protection to Production (PtoP) Project.3,4
The narrative is complemented with the results
of a metadata analysis of the impact evaluations
available for 20 programs in 10 African countries (Ralston, Andrews, and Hsiao 2017); as well
as a systematic review of 56 cash transfers programs (including unconditional cash transfers,
conditional cash transfers, noncontributory social
pensions, and enterprise grants) in low- and
middle-income countries from 2000 to 2015
(Bastagli et al. 2016).
Findings from these evaluations consistently
show statistically positive impacts of cash transfer
programs on productive outcomes such as crop
production, productive investments, employment, and more effective risk-coping mechanisms. The findings include income-multiplier
effects for beneficiary and nonbeneficiary households and local economies. They debunk misconceptions like cash transfers being handouts that

promote dependency and induce wasteful consumption. On the contrary, cash transfers have
economic impacts beyond their intended objectives that strengthen beneficiary livelihoods and,
if complemented with other instruments, can be
leveraged to produce long-lasting benefits for
beneficiaries, paving their way out of poverty.

WHAT ARE THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF
CASH TRANSFERS ON BENEFICIARIES
AND THEIR HOUSEHOLDS?
Household Production
Impact evaluations indicate that cash transfers
increase household crop production, lead to
changes in types of crops cultivated, and increase
consumption and sales of homegrown production. The evaluation of programs in seven SubSaharan African countries found significant
impacts in all these areas, even though their
magnitude varied across countries (Daidone
et al. 2016). Crop production increased in
Zambia and Lesotho. The value of the overall
production in Zambia almost doubled, boosting
postprogram per capita consumption to a level
25 percent higher than the transfer itself (Davis
et al. 2016). In Ethiopia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe,
transfers led to changes in the types of crops
cultivated. In Kenya and Malawi-Mchinji, the
cash transfer increased consumption of the
home-grown production (Davis et al. 2016).
Consumption and Productive Investments
Robust evidence indicates that households use
transfers for basic needs and productive investments, dispelling myths of profligate spending.
A meta-analysis conducted on impacts for seven
African countries found that on average, household consumption increases by US$0.74 for
each US$1 transferred (Ralston, Andrews, and
Hsiao 2017). The magnitude of this impact varies across countries, with the largest impact
experienced by programs targeted at the poor:
the Malawi Social Cash Transfer Program
reports the largest consumption impact, at
179 percent of the transfer value. In addition, a
review of 19 programs and 11 studies using data
from Africa, Asia, and Latin America found no
evidence that transfers, conditional or unconditional, increase the use of ­alcohol and tobacco
(Evans and Popova 2014).
The State of Social Safety Nets 2018

The review by Bastagli et al. (2016) found that
cash transfers improved household consumption in 25 of 35 studies looking at this effect.
Their review also found an increase in livestock
ownership/purchase, agricultural assets and
inputs, and savings (although not for all programs or for all types of livestock, assets, or
inputs). The Transfer Project found that five out
of eight programs had significant impacts on the
increase in livestock ownership. The effect of
households investing in diverse types of animals
was large in Malawi and Zambia, whereas more
limited effects were observed in Kenya, Lesotho,
and Zimbabwe, where small livestock were
acquired. Impacts were not found in Ghana. The
meta-data analysis by Ralston, Andrews, and
Hsiao (2017) confirms these findings by estimating a combined average increase of 34 percent in livestock ownership across ­programs in
seven countries (four were significant).
Most programs had significant impacts on
the purchase/use of agricultural inputs such as
seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides, although the
magnitude of these impacts varied across countries. In terms of agricultural assets (for example, axes, hoes, picks, and other tools), positive
impacts were observed in Ethiopia, Malawi,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Impacts were not
observed in Kenya, Lesotho, and Ghana. Even
though all impacts were not always significant,
all countries reported positive significant results
for population subgroups, type of animal, or
asset (Daidone et al. 2016; Davis et al. 2016;
Handa et al. 2017).

Labor and Time Allocation
Impact evaluations generally show no evidence
that cash transfers reduce the labor s­ upply. In the
African context, transfers have an impact on
household decision making on labor allocation
and time use, in terms of switching between different income-­
generating activities or between
labor, domestic tasks, or leisure (Handa et al.
2017). In other words, cash transfers give households flexibility to allocate time and labor to these
activities, leading to a switch from casual agricultural labor to on-farm labor (David et al. 2016).
As a female beneficiary in Malawi expressed with
respect to doing casual labor or ganyu: “I used to
be a slave to ganyu but now I’m a bit free” (Barca

et al. 2015). In the context of informal rural labor
markets, casual wage labor is a last-resort activity
that households use to survive or when liquid
funds are scarce. Therefore, for beneficiaries to
increase work and time on their own farms is a
preferred activity and a sign of improved economic conditions. These findings are consistent
with other studies that have concluded that transfers do not reduce the labor supply or create
dependency. For example, Banerjee et al. (2015),
after conducting seven randomized control trials of cash transfers programs in six countries (Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico, Morocco,
Nicaragua, and the Philippines), found no evidence that cash transfers have impacts on either
the propensity to work or the overall number of
hours worked.

Risk Management and Coping Strategies
Cash transfers, impact evaluations find, allow
beneficiary households to manage risk more
effectively by diversifying income-generating
activities, increasing savings, and reducing detrimental coping strategies. In Zambia, the share of
beneficiary households running nonfarm enterprises increased 16 ­percentage points, and the
businesses reported 1.4 more months in operation, compared with the control group, after
receiving cash transfers. In Zimbabwe, there was
an increase of 5 percentage points in the share of
households operating these businesses and an
increase of 5 percentage points in the share
reporting profits. Other countries do not report
significant results (Daidone et al. 2016). In Ghana,
a qualitative evaluation finds evidence of increased
petty trading of small amounts of kerosene and
the sale of cooked food (Barca et al. 2015).
Cash transfers often lead to increasing savings.
Ghana and Zambia reported increases in savings
of 11 and 24 percentage points, respectively. In
Ethiopia, Ghana, and Malawi transfers led to a
reduction of loans and debt repayments (Daidone
et al. 2016). In Zambia and Zimbabwe, transfers
contributed to an increase in households’ creditworthiness; however, households were still risk
averse and reluctant to take on new credit (Davis
et al. 2016). Ralston, Andrews, and Hsiao (2017)
found that beneficiary households are 20 percentage points more likely to save compared with
the control group; this translates into an average

Evidence from Impact Evaluations in Sub-Saharan Africa

increase of 92 percent in the number of households setting aside savings.
Studies also report a decrease in negative
risk-coping strategies, such as distress sales of
assets, begging, eating less, or putting children to
work. Ethiopia, Lesotho, and Malawi reported
less begging and changes in eating habits.
Beneficiary households were less likely to take
children out of school in almost all the countries
analyzed by Davis et al. (2016) and Daidone et al.
(2016). As an elderly beneficiary in Ethiopia
said: “Hunger pushed me to do this [beg]. Since
I started to receive the cash transfer I no longer
have to. I feel happier” (Barca et al. 2015).
Qualitative evaluations also show that cash
transfers programs increase social capital. They
help beneficiaries reenter social networks,
strengthening informal social protection systems
and risk-sharing management arrangements
(Davis et al. 2016). The very poor faced fewer stigmas, participated more fully in the community,
and supported other households or institutions
because of the transfers.

Spillover Effects in Local Economies
Cash transfer programs not only bring economic
impacts to beneficiary individuals and households but also can create spillover effects that
benefit nonbeneficiary households and local
economies. When beneficiaries spend transfers,
cash is injected into local markets, potentially
creating income multipliers. That is, for each
US$1 transferred to a beneficiary household, the
total income of the local economy may increase
by more than US$1. These spillovers are difficult
to measure by experimental methods because
they are second-order impacts that are diffused
over a population greater than the beneficiary
population (Thome et al. 2016). However,
researchers developed the Local Economy-Wide
Impact Evaluation (LEWIE) to simulate the
effect of cash transfers in local economies.
LEWIE measures the impact of cash transfers on
the production activities of beneficiary and nonbeneficiary households, how these effects change
during programs scaled up, and the reasons these
effects happen (Taylor 2012).5
In Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe, cash transfers have significant spillovers in the local economy and
68
68

nominal income multipliers. Using the LEWIE
model, income multipliers range from 1.27 in
Malawi to 2.52 in Ethiopia (Hintalo region). The
income spillover (­multiplier minus 1) indicates
that for every US$1 transferred to the beneficiary household, the local economy gains an
additional US$0.27–1.25 (Thome et al. 2016).
After considering potential inflation, simulations find that the real income multiplier, even
though lower than the nominal multiplier, is still
greater than 1 for all seven countries. If producers
in the local economy face constraints to increase
production in response to the higher demand of
goods led by the transfers, this may put upward
pressure on prices and lower income multipliers.
However, even after accounting for inflation,
income multipliers are still greater than 1, ranging
from 1.08 in Kenya (Nyanza Province) to 1.81 in
Ethiopia (Hintalo). The elasticity of the supply of
local goods largely drives the differences between
real and nominal multipliers. In economies that
can easily increase the supply of goods, the price
increase is small and nominal and real multipliers
are similar (Thome et al. 2016).

Social Assistance and Aging

M

ost individuals will reach old age. If aging
is almost a certainty for so many individuals, how can elderly people mitigate welfare risks or potential problems such as illness or
disability? Social insurance programs can offer
coverage of illness, disability, and other potential
risks for a significant number of elderly people.
However, in most developing countries, people
with low income are more exposed to these risks.
Social insurance might be restricted to a small
group of workers, such as formal employees or
employees in certain sectors. For those individuals
who are not covered, the option of voluntary savings is close to impossible because a low income
makes it difficult to save, and existing instruments
for long-term savings are unavailable to them.
This chapter describes a key component that
countries are rapidly introducing to support the
special needs of elderly people: old-age social
pensions.1 This type of program is becoming an
important policy tool to address issues of low
social insurance coverage and, in some cases, to
address aspects of poverty alleviation. This
chapter provides the general characteristics of
noncontributory old-age social pensions in different regions, describes recent trends, gives
performance indicators, and includes a special
highlight on policy and implementation discussions and considerations (see highlight 2).
WHAT ARE OLD-AGE SOCIAL PENSIONS,
AND WHY ARE THEY ON THE RISE?
An aging population is a common trend
across regions. For some regions, the onset of the
Social Assistance and Aging

trend will be sooner; for other regions, the effect
of the trend will be much greater (see figure 4.1).
Today, the Europe and Central Asia region has
the largest percentage of elderly people; in the
long term, Latin America and the Caribbean,
South Asia, and East Asia and Pacific will experience the biggest increase. Although elderly
people now represent 8 percent of the total population in Latin America and the Caribbean,
their share is projected to grow nearly four times
by the year 2100. While the share of elderly people now represents 5 and 8 percent of the total
populations in South Asia and East Asia and
Pacific, respectively, their shares are projected to
grow over five times in South Asia (to 27 ­percent)
and over 3.5 times in East Asia and Pacific (to 29
percent) by 2100 (United Nations Population
Research Council 2017).
Despite the evident aging trend, most countries do not have systems and benefits that can
fully cover elderly people or their special needs.
Many countries have social insurance programs, but not everyone participates in those.
In this context, very often the old-age social
pension becomes a key instrument for providing social assistance coverage in old age.
Old-age social pensions are here defined as
noncontributory cash benefits targeted at elderly
people, generally provided and financed by governments, and not linked to past contributions,
earnings, or years of service. Old-age social
­pensions take different forms, but their main
parameters for eligibility include age, citizenship,
residency, and, in some cases, means testing.

Three main characteristics of old-age social
pensions set them apart from social insurance
and some social assistance programs (Palacios
and Knox-Vydmanov 2014). First, there is an
important distinction between social pensions
and minimum pensions. Minimum pensions
are set up as the minimum guaranteed benefit
provided by social insurance systems, while
social pensions in countries with social insurance systems tend to be set below the minimum
pension and to be accessible to those who have
not made any contributions; have not participated in any mandatory scheme; and/or have an
extremely low income. Second, old-age social
pensions tend to be publicly financed out of
government revenues (through general taxation). The third core distinction is between
old-age social pensions and broader social
­
assistance. Old-age social pensions are social
assistance benefits exclusively targeted at older
people. Social assistance programs can include
and cover, but are not necessarily targeted at,
elderly people.
Old-age social pensions were introduced in
some countries almost as early as social insurance. In 1891, Denmark introduced a local
72

social pension for poor citizens 60 years of
age and older. New Zealand (1898), Australia
(1908), Iceland (1909), the United Kingdom
(1909), and Sweden (1913) then followed this
policy. The first social pensions were meanstested. It was not until 1938 that New Zealand,
for example, introduced a universal pension for
individuals age 65 years and older.2 Figure 4.2
presents the evolution of old-age social pension
systems around the world. Between 1940 and
1990, many countries introduced this type of
social security benefit. Yet, around half of all
old-age social pension programs have existed
only since 1990.
Old-age social pensions have proliferated in
the past two decades. Since 2001, 29 economies
have introduced or expanded this social assistance/social safety net instrument (figure 4.3).
Latin America and the Caribbean have led
the trend, followed by East Asia and several
African economies. In addition, economies that
already had a social pension system (mostly contributory systems) introduced parallel benefits
aimed at covering different groups (for example,
the rural programs and “70 and Up” in Mexico).
By 2014, an estimated 101 economies had

WHY DO COUNTRIES INTRODUCE
OLD-AGE SOCIAL PENSIONS?
Old-age social pensions are introduced on the
basis of an economy’s needs and capacity, in
particular to alleviate poverty, establish the
main component of a pension system, or

address a coverage gap in an existing pension
system (see map 4.1). Bangladesh, India,
Kenya, Myanmar, and Vietnam, for example,
have introduced old-age social pensions as
poverty alleviation programs. Australia and
New Zealand (pioneer economies) and
Bolivia, Maldives, and Timor-Leste (newcomer economies) have introduced old-age
social pensions as the main component of
their pension systems, in the form of universal
pensions. Other economies have used old-age
social pensions to address the coverage gap
left by existing mandatory pension schemes
(see highlight 2 for a policy discussion on
introducing old-age social pensions and the
special considerations that inform their
design). Among those, some have mature contributory schemes but insufficient coverage
(for example, Chile and Mexico), while others
have immature contributory schemes for significant aging population trends (for example,
Hong Kong SAR, China; the Republic of
Korea; and Thailand).
Old-age social pensions reflect the economy
context and take one of two forms: universal or
means-tested. Universal pensions provide flatrate benefits to all elderly people, generally
74

those who reach a certain age and fulfill citizenship or residency criteria. Old-age social
pensions can be considered a type of unconditional cash transfer.4 Means-tested or targeted
programs provide benefits to the poor, who
tend not to be covered by other (contributory)
elements of the pension system. Means-tested
benefits have the potential to be a main source
of income for elderly people, and thus have
the capacity to be pension-tested (that is,
the capacity to exclude beneficiaries of other
pension schemes).5 Figure 4.4 presents, for
each region, the share of economies that had a
social pension by 2014, the type of social pension, and the average total cost to GDP by
region. Nearly 90 percent of Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) economies, 70 percent of Latin America
and the Caribbean economies, and nearly
65 percent of Europe and Central Asian economies have old-age social pensions (panel a).
Means-tested pensions are most common
among all regions, except for Europe and
Central Asia, where pension-tested schemes
dominate (panel b).
The design of each program in terms of the
eligibility age is independent of the type of

pension. Figure 4.5 shows the diversity of the
design across regions by analyzing the age of
eligibility. Panel a shows the minimum, maximum, and mean by region. In most regions, the
mean ­eligibility age tends to be 65 years, except
for Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East
and North Africa. Panel b presents the average
age of eligibility by gender. Old-age social pensions across regions often include age differentiation between men and women, with the latter
usually eligible five years earlier.
WHAT HAVE OLD-AGE SOCIAL PENSIONS
ACCOMPLISHED?
Old-age social pensions provide an alternative
source of income for elderly people who are not
covered by contributory schemes. Social pensions cover close to 35 percent of the population age 60 years and older in Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development
countries and in the Europe and Central Asia,
East Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the
Caribbean, and South Asia regions, according
to estimations from HelpAge International data
(figure 4.6). The Africa region has the largest

76

coverage of old-age social pensions (measured
as a percentage of the population age 60 years
and older).6 In contrast, a few Middle Eastern
and North African countries have introduced
social pensions.
Old-age social pensions have expanded rapidly in certain countries. Between 2010 and
2015, the number of beneficiaries in Chile,
Mexico, the Philippines, and Vietnam grew by
more than 70 percent (lowering the eligibility
age often drives such expansion). In Bolivia,
Mauritius, and Namibia, coverage of the population age 60 years and older has become
universal.7
Elderly people in the first (poorest) quintile
have benefited the most from old-age social
pensions, no matter the program design. Using
household survey data from the Atlas of Social
Protection: Indicators of Resilience and Equity
(ASPIRE) database, the distribution of beneficiaries (or beneficiary incidence) of old-age
social pension programs was estimated.8
Figure 4.7 presents the distribution of old-age
social pension beneficiaries by quintile of per
capita pretransfer welfare and by type of

t­argeting method, based on available data. In
Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, and Turkey, more
than 50 percent of the old-age social pension
beneficiaries are in the poorest quintile,
while in Swaziland and Guatemala, more than
50 percent of the beneficiaries of social pensions are in the wealthiest (fourth and fifth)
quintiles.
Old-age social pensions provide income
security and dignity in old age. To analyze the
relative importance of the old-age social pension, Figure 4.8 presents the level of pension
benefits as a share of beneficiary welfare for the
poorest and second-poorest quintiles. In Brazil,
Mauritius, and South Africa, old-age social
pensions represent more than 50 percent of the
total welfare for elderly people (and their households as indirect beneficiaries) in the poorest
quintile.
Old-age social pensions have helped beneficiaries reduce or altogether escape poverty. In a
sample of 18 countries (see figure 4.9), the effect
of old-age social pensions on the poverty headcount and poverty gap reduction is significant
(10–40 percent) in only three (Mauritius, South
Africa, and Thailand). In the other 16 countries,
the poverty impact is much less pronounced.

Social Assistance and Aging

Furthermore, the effect of old-age social pensions on inequality (as a reduction in the Gini
coefficient for the o
­ verall population) is less than
10 percent (see ­figure 4.9), except for the same
three countries (where coverage and benefit
­levels are high).
In some African and Latin American countries, elderly people are not necessarily among
the poorest, so the benefit’s impact on poverty
alleviation might be marginal. While Mali,
Mauritius, and Namibia have large shares
of elderly people in the poorest households
(32 percent, 38 percent, and 43 percent, respectively), they have even larger shares of children
who live there (92 percent, 64 percent, and
95 percent, respectively), Guven and Leite
(2016) note. However, in Argentina, Brazil, and
Chile, mandatory schemes and social pensions
have contributed to lowering poverty among
elderly people; they also had a larger overall
poverty reduction impact than programs targeted at children (Acosta, Leite, and Rigolini
2011). BÖger et al. (forthcoming) find that more
than 50 percent of countries worldwide with
old-age social pensions have raised elderly
­people above the international poverty line but
not above national poverty lines.

Note: Countries are selected based on the availability of reliable household survey data (ASPIRE). Pensions as a share of beneficiary
welfare is defined as the ratio of the pension size to the average household per capita consumption or income of the respective
welfare quintile (Q1: bottom 20 percent; Q2: bottom 21–40 percent). The poorest first and second quintiles are calculated using

Old-age social pensions have mixed results
in reducing poverty, as seen in the benefit–
cost ratio, measured as the reduction in the
poverty gap obtained for each US$1 spent.9
On average, among the social pensions
and countries included in this analysis, the
benefit–cost ratio is 0.32, meaning that every

Social Assistance and Aging

US$1 spent on old-age social pensions reduces
the poverty gap by 32 cents. Only Latvia and
Lithuania have a ratio above 0.5. The design of
the old-age social pension (universal or
means-tested) likely affects this indicator, but
more evidence is needed to better understand
the potential link.

NOTES

1. In this book, old-age social pensions and social
­pensions are defined differently. Social pensions
(­discussed in part I) are defined using the ASPIRE
database and include old-age social pensions, noncontributory disability benefits, noncontributory
benefits to war victims or war veterans, and noncontributory survivorship benefits.

2. The 1938 Social Security Act lowered the age for the
means-tested pension to 60 and introduced a universal (not means-tested) superannuation from age
65 years (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_in​
_New_Zealand).
3. HelpAge’s Social Pensions Database (http://www​
.pension-watch.net/about-social-pensions/about​
-­
social-pensions/social-pensions-database). For 20
of these 101 countries, there is no information on
when the social pension was established.
4. More specifically, they are conditional only on an age
threshold.
5. Countries like South Africa include an income test
and an asset test. Beneficiaries cannot have assets
worth more than R1,056,000 (US$77,728) if single or
R2,112,000 (US$155,456) if married.
6. Coverage in Africa ranges from universal programs
in Southern Africa to no programs in many countries
across the continent. Hence, a measure of “average”
coverage could be misleading.
7. Coverage rates above 100 percent are possible.
Beneficiaries under universal old-age social pensions
might outnumber the potential population of recipients because of identification issues (such as weak
death registration systems) or fraud.
8. Beneficiary incidence is the percentage of program
beneficiaries belonging to each quintile of the welfare
distribution.

9. More precisely, the benefit–cost ratio is estimated
as the poverty gap before the transfer minus the poverty gap divided by the total amount spent in the
program.

HIGHLIGHT 2. Policy Considerations for Introducing Old-Age Social Pensions

M

ost pension systems are mandatory, earnings-related, contributory programs. The
first and second pillars of the pension system are mandatory (based on the World Bank’s
typology), either publicly or privately managed,
and linked to workers’ length of service or previous contributions (Pallares-Miralles, Romero, and
Whitehouse 2012). These schemes tend to cover
public sector employees, the military, occupational
schemes, and, in some cases, the private sector, as
well as facilitating the participation of the self-­
employed. In the Middle East and North Africa
region and in many countries in Asia, most mandatory schemes cover only public sector employees and occupational schemes. Coverage as a
percentage of the labor force of the working-age
population and coverage of those age 60 years and
older or 65 years and older (relative to the size of
the population group) have decreased over time.
Different reasons have prevented mandatory
schemes from reaching full coverage. Even though
these schemes (first and second pillars) have been
in place in low- and middle-income countries for
decades, the labor force share (mainly in the formal sector) eligible to participate in them is low
and has remained almost constant over time. The
Latin America and the Caribbean region, for
example, has high levels of informality as pensions systems are largely designed for salaried
workers (Bosch, Melguizo, and Pagés 2013). In
many Sub-Saharan African countries, pension
schemes do not cover employees in the private
sector and the combination of high contribution
rates for social insurance, low wages, and high
informality restrict coverage (Dorfman 2015).
The rural poor are very unlikely to be able to participate in earnings-related pension schemes,
Guven and Leite (2016) find. In addition, many
civil servants and occupational schemes tend to
be unfunded while providing high benefit
levels. This limits the financial capacity of governments to introduce and implement other programs targeted at elderly people and the poor.
To this end, old-age social pensions are fast
becoming a tool to meet the urgent needs of
expanding ­
coverage and alleviating poverty
(Palacios and Knox-Vydmanov 2014). In Africa,
full coverage of elderly people is (nearly) attained
only in countries that have old-age social pensions
(see figure H2.1). These high coverage rates are

simply not possible through social insurance or
mandatory pension schemes.
The short- and long-term fiscal implications of
old-age social pensions need to be considered carefully. Guven and Leite (2016) find that certain SubSaharan African countries expend most of the social
protection budget on old-age programs; 29–61 percent of total social assistance spending goes to oldage social pension programs. Bosch, Melguizo, and
Pagés (2013) describe how, in Latin America, universal old-age social pensions provide coverage for
elderly people but require considerable resources; in
some cases, governments transfer resources from
infrastructure, health, and/or education budgets to
meet pension obligations.
The State of Social Safety Nets 2018

Analyzing the long-term costs of old-age programs, given either slow or fast demographic
changes, is imperative. In several regions, the population age 65 years and older as a percentage of the
total population will double by 2050, jeopardizing
the fiscal sustainability of old-age social pensions.
Understanding the relationship between demographic trends, macroeconomic and labor market
conditions, and key program parameters is necessary to maintain the fiscal sustainability of programs not only now but also in the medium and
long terms.
Introducing old-age social pensions should take
into consideration factors beyond closing the coverage gap. Key elements of program design and
impact should be carefully analyzed before implementing such programs. This analysis should also
take into consideration the overall social assistance
programs in place in a country to avoid an overlap
of benefits and to ensure an efficient use of limited
resources.
From a design perspective, universal and meanstested programs have clear trade-offs in efficiency,
cost, and effectiveness of implementation. In addition, parameters such as age of eligibility, benefit
levels, and benefit indexations can all affect people’s
behavior during their working life, creating incentives or disincentives to participate or not in the
pension system and/or in the labor force. Although
a universal program might be perceived as easier to
implement (that is, it leverages existing administrative capacities and reduces potential errors of
inclusion and/or exclusion), it can be more expensive. Dorfman (2015) shows that despite the challenges of implementing an old-age social pension
system targeted exclusively at the elderly poor, the
policy has been found to reduce national poverty at
almost twice the rate of a universal approach. In
addition, targeting those age 65 years and older,
rather than 60 years and older, has a significantly
greater impact.
Setting the eligibility age, the benefit level, and the
benefit indexation are key elements in the design and
performance of an old-age social pension program.
For example, if the benefit level is high and the eligibility age is close to or the same as the main social
insurance, an old-age social pension might discourage labor force participation. Bosch, Melguizo, and
Pagés (2013) find that certain parameters of old-age

Social Assistance and Aging

social pensions in Latin America and the Caribbean,
particularly when they exist in parallel with contributory pension systems, can affect labor market
dynamics and generate incentives for informal
employment.
An analysis at the microeconomic level, such as
household characteristics, is also necessary to inform
the instrument design. The poverty gap of elderly
people living alone can be misconstrued. Guven and
Leite (2016) find that for a set of countries in Africa,
the poverty headcount is significantly higher for
households with children than for any other population group. Dorfman (2015) shows that many
African countries have high co-residency levels and
that elderly people rarely live alone. Thus, social
assistance programs targeted at poor households
can benefit elderly people as much as other members, including children.
The context for old-age social pension design
and implementation matters. Old-age social pensions are both a form of social assistance/safety net
for alleviating poverty and a potential component
of pension systems for addressing coverage gaps.
Considering the totality of existing social assistance
programs, the priorities and needs of the overall
population, and budget constraints when analyzing
their introduction, are essential to designing an
effective old-age social pension system.

CHAPTER 5
The Emergence of Adaptive
Social Protection

WHY DOES THE WORLD NEED ADAPTIVE
SOCIAL PROTECTION?
Today’s global landscape is fraught with multiple, interconnected, and often devastating
shocks. Between 1980 and 2012, the annual
frequency of natural disasters increased by
­
250 percent and the number of people affected
increased 140 percent (figure 5.1). Climate
change is expected to exacerbate these trends
and, without climate-informed development, to
push an additional 100 million people into
extreme poverty by 2030 (World Bank 2016b).
Forced displacement also has hit record highs;
on average, 20 persons were estimated to have
fled their homes every 60 seconds in 2016
(UNHCR 2016). In total, more than 64 million
people were displaced worldwide by the end of
2015 (figure 5.2). Furthermore, the worst economic and financial shock in recent history
materialized less than a decade ago, and the
2014 Ebola outbreak reawakened the global
community to the potential devastation of pandemics. Such shocks, their trends, and associated risks are deeply interconnected (see, for
example, WEF 2017), creating an environment
of heightened complexity for households, policy makers, and practitioners alike to navigate.
Never has the challenge been more acute for
social safety nets (SSNs) to build household
resilience and to respond to shocks across the
life cycle. Significant progress has been made in
the past decade in terms of introducing new
SSN programs and scaling up existing programs
to expand the coverage of the poorest, as this

84

book details. As a result, safety nets are better
positioned than ever to help households manage the risks associated with the multiplicity
and complexity of shocks. Indeed, SSNs and the
broader social protection suite of policies, programs, and instruments are widely recognized
as successful tools for building the resilience of
the poor and most vulnerable. Specifically, the
World Bank Social Protection and Labor
Strategy (2012b) emphasizes that social protection builds the resilience “of the vulnerable
through insuring against the impact of drops in
well-being from a range of shocks.” Safety nets
can provide cash, food, insurance, and other
means to smooth income and consumption
when shocks occur, increasing the resilience of
households. When combined with complementary interventions, safety nets can enhance
household resilience in the long term by
promoting human capital development and
­
income-generating activities (World Bank
2012b).
However, limitations in SSN coverage and
design restrict the ability for safety nets to protect households that are vulnerable to shocks.
Generally, the poor are particularly vulnerable
to shocks for multiple reasons, which include a
lack of savings and limited access to finance
and formal insurance (see, for example, World
Bank 2016a). To protect their short-term
well-being and consumption after a shock,
poorer households may instead turn to such
“negative coping” strategies as removing children from school to work for extra household

income, availing high-interest loans, and selling productive assets. However, such shortterm coping strategies can work to the
household’s longer term detriment. Receiving
assistance from safety nets can lessen the need
for such negative coping strategies after shocks
occur. But the persistent undercoverage of the
poorest and most vulnerable to shocks means
that those most in need of such support may
have no access to SSNs. Furthermore, rigid program design can hamper attempts to adjust
parameters to meet changed needs on the
ground, reaching beyond a core SSN caseload
after a shock has occurred.
For example, empirical evidence suggests
that countries at high risk of natural disasters
often have lower safety net coverage. Figure 5.3,
panel a, measures the coverage of all SSN programs within a country (based on the latest-­
year data in the Atlas of Social Protection:
Indicators of Resilience and Equity [ASPIRE]
database) against a country’s risk from natural
disasters (as ranked by the 2016 World Risk
Report). While there is a significant degree of
variance, most disaster-prone countries have
large coverage gaps, leaving those most at risk,
in many cases, unreachable by safety net programming. Furthermore, the lack of coverage is
even more evident among the poorest quintile
(figure 5.3, panel b). In both cases, the South
Asia and Africa regions, home to the world’s
largest share of poor, have safety net coverage
well below ­
levels commensurate with their
disaster risk.
There is a large degree of heterogeneity in
terms of the readiness and suitability of national
safety net programs to play more prominent
roles where shocks are concerned. Figure 5.4
again looks at SSN coverage, this time alongside
a measurement of humanitarian aid received,
per capita (from Gentilini 2016). Safety nets do
not exist in a vacuum, and national systems and
humanitarian programming coexist to varying
degrees, depending on the context. The data are
somewhat porous, but three broad country
groupings can be drawn. Countries in Group A
have higher safety net coverage and lower
humanitarian spending, indicating greater readiness and suitability for their safety nets to
address the risk of shocks; examples include the
Philippines’ Pantawid Conditional Cash Transfer

86

Program and Kenya’s rapidly growing Hunger
Safety Nets Program. Countries in Group C have
lower safety net coverage and higher humanitarian spending—including countries mired in crises and fragility such as Afghanistan, Democratic
Republic of Congo and Haiti—and may be less
well prepared to institute government-led safety
nets and more reliant on humanitarian funding
and related programming. Countries in Group B
have both low safety net coverage and low
humanitarian spending, indicating they may be
less beset by persistent crises than those countries in Group C. For such countries, it may be
particularly beneficial to further invest in safety
nets and their use for building household resilience to shocks.
In this context, Adaptive Social Protection
(ASP) has emerged in recent years. At the outset, ASP was conceptualized as “a series of
measures which aim to build resilience of the
poorest and most vulnerable people to climate
change by combining elements of social protection, disaster risk reduction and climate
change” (Arnall et al. 2010; see also IDS 2012).
Since then, the term “adaptive” has come to be
­understood by social protection policy makers
and practitioners as entailing the need to better adapt social protection to all types of
shocks. This recognition has resulted in many
complex questions, including precisely how
best can SSNs and social protection be
equipped to help households manage diverse
types of shocks across myriad country contexts
(Groups A, B, and C)? Because is a nascent
area, this question is not fully answered; but it
has begun to crystalize around two interrelated
approaches focused on building household
resilience and increasing the responsiveness of
programming.
FOCUS AREA 1: BUILDING HOUSEHOLD
RESILIENCE BEFORE SHOCKS OCCUR
The first of these interrelated approaches centers on boosting the role of social protection
and safety nets in building the resilience of
the most vulnerable households before shocks
occur. By doing so, this resilience-building
approach seeks to break the deleterious cycle of
poverty and vulnerability that may otherwise
occur. In short, a more resilient household will
be better able to withstand shocks if household

members have more human capital and are able
to access job opportunities, accumulate physical capital, and diversify their livelihoods.
Significant evidence confirms that SSNs,
adaptive or otherwise, help improve resilience
at the household level. Impact evaluations indicate that beneficiaries of cash transfer programs
are more likely to save, as seen in Ghana’s

(LEAP), Kenya’s Hunger Safety Net Program,
and Zambia’s Child Grant Program (World

In 2010, 54 percent of public works households
reported making a distress sale of assets to meet
food needs, and 26 percent did so to obtain cash
for nonfood emergency cash needs. By 2014,
these proportions had fallen to 25 and 13 percent, respectively. Brazil’s Bolsa Família delayed
the entry of children into the labor market.
Children in beneficiary families of the Programa
de Asignacion Familiar in Honduras are less
likely to work. Children in the Philippines’
Pantawid conditional cash transfer program
work six fewer days per month than a control
group (World Bank 2016c). These are selected
examples from a proliferating body of evidence
reporting similar findings.
The evidence base for the impact of productive inclusion interventions (“graduation
models”) that support sustainable exits from
­
poverty—and by extension, resilience-­building—
is also growing. A primary example of this comes
from a randomized control trial for a similar
“integrated approach” in six countries (Ethiopia,
Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru).

88

It combined the transfer of a productive asset
with consumption support, training, and coaching, as well as efforts to encourage savings and
access to health and education s­ ervices. The trial
found statistically significant, cost-effective
impacts on consumption (fueled mostly by
increases in self-employment income) and the
psychosocial status of the targeted households,
with impacts on the poor households lasting at
least a year after all implementation had ended
(Banerjee et al. 2015).
This productive, inclusive approach is
being implemented in many countries across
West and East Africa, where similar ASPfocused initiatives look to boost household
resilience in the face of repeated and chronic
drought, along with other shocks. A recent
World Bank publication, Social Protection
Programs for Africa’s Drylands (Del Ninno
and Coll-Black 2016), describes resilience
building as a process of “improving households’ or communities’ economic and social
stability by addressing their structural

The State of Social Safety Nets 2018

vulnerabilities and increasing their access to
services while helping them prepare against
future crises. . . . This is achieved at the household level, for instance, through the regular
distribution of cash transfers accompanied by
training activities to help diversify livelihoods
away from climate-dependent activities.” In
this context, resilience may be the product of
(i) diversified livelihood strategies and access
to markets; (ii) access to financial, social,
human, physical, and natural capital; (iii)
access to quality basic social services; (iv)
access to social protection programs, including safety nets, particularly in difficult periods; (v) access to the information and skills
needed to adapt to shocks; and (vi) local and
national institutions able to adapt to changing realities.
In the form of public works, ASP programs
can reduce the sources of risk from a shock in
rural areas, as has been done in Ethiopia,
Rwanda, and across the Sahel. A well-known
example is the public works component of
Ethiopia’s PSNP. It helps increase household
and community resilience to droughts by creating community assets that reverse the severe
degradation of watersheds and provide a more
reliable water supply under different climatic
conditions. Similarly, the Rwanda Vision 2020
Umurenge Program targets public works for
creating anti-erosive ditches and terracing hillsides, improving soil productivity, and expanding the area of cultivable land (IDS 2012).
FOCUS AREA 2: INCREASING THE
CAPABILITY OF SAFETY NETS TO
RESPOND TO SHOCKS AFTER THEY
OCCUR
The second interrelated approach to ASP
focuses on increasing the capability of safety
nets to respond to shocks after they occur
by introducing greater flexibility and scalability in program design. Such design features
enable faster adjustment to postshock needs.
Conceptually, a program becomes capable of
“scaling out” to nonregular social protection
beneficiaries that have been affected by a
shock and/or “scaling up” to increase benefit
amounts at an acute time of need to existing
social protection beneficiaries (see figure 5.5).
This process is also referred to as “horizontal”

The Emergence of Adaptive Social Protection

and “vertical” expansion (Oxford Policy
Management 2015). A commonly cited example of an SSN with these c­apabilities is
Ethiopia’s PSNP, as witnessed by its response
to the 2011 drought (see box 5.1).
Increasing grant amounts to existing SSN
beneficiaries following shocks (vertical expansion) is a pragmatic and increasingly common
safety net response. Leveraged in this way,
existing programs such as cash transfers and
public works can can be used as conduits to
rapidly inject assistance to pretargeted and
enrolled poor households in affected areas.
Recently, this approach reached existing beneficiaries that were affected by disasters in Fiji and
the Philippines (see box 5.2). Preparedness
measures for SSNs can be advanced even further through additional investments to make
programs more flexible and capable of expanding horizontally to reach additional households,
as in the case of the PSNP.
Specifially, horizontal expansion can be
achieved by investing in more dynamic delivery systems. Safety nets designed to address
chronic poverty in times of relative calm
and stability adopt methodologies and
supply-driven approaches to delivery for a
­
fixed period. These may include time-bound
approaches to targeting (that is, a “census
sweep” approach, repeated again only after
several years have passed) and fixed, centralized lists of beneficiaries. This approach is typically easier to administer, but its rigidity often
produces unintended effects (for example,
household exclusion errors), which are magnified under the influence of shocks when needs,
poverty status, well-being, and vulnerability
can change rapidly. In this sense, these delivery systems are static; they are unable to
administratively respond to changes in household needs. The hallmark of an adaptive safety
net is dynamic delivery systems that enable the
required flexibility and scalability to achieve
horizontal and/or vertical expansion, depending on postshock needs.
In addition, information systems tied to
understanding risks and vulnerabilities, along
with pre-positioned risk financing, can imbue
safety net programs with the capability to
­horizontally expand and to reach more affected
households. Early warning and related risk

BOX 5.1 Horizontal and Vertical Expansions through Ethiopia’s Productive
Safety Net Program
Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP)
is a large, national SSN program. It is designed to
respond to the impacts of chronic drought, food
insecurity, and climate change on Ethiopia’s
poorest households. To do so, the PSNP incorporates public works activities that improve climate
resilience and promote community-level adaptation; provide a federal contingency budget to
help poor households and communities better
cope with transitory shocks when they occur; and
target methods to identify those ­communities

information (e.g., hazard mapping, market
monitoring, meteorological monitoring, conflict mapping, climate variance mapping, and
geospatial data), along with information on
household composition and characteristics,

most vulnerable to shocks and climate change.
These investments in more dynamic targeting for
the PSNP and other preparedness measures
enabled the program to extend the duration of its
regular support for 6.5 million existing beneficiaries, ­providing an extra three months of assistance (vertical expansion), while also extending
programming to an additional 3.1 million people
who were not in the core PSNP caseload (horizontal expansion) in response to the droughts of
2011 (White and Ellis 2012).

systems often work in silos without coordination, integration, and direct linkages to social
safety net programming. The Dominican
Republic, Kenya, and the Republic of Yemen
have all developed innovative and integrated
information systems, looking to overcome
these limitations (see box 5.3). Alongside
these information systems, pre-­
positioned
financing is of critical importance for more

BOX 5.2 Responding Rapidly to Disasters through Vertical Expansions in Fiji
and the Philippines
In response to Typhoon Yolanda in 2013, the
government of the Philippines released the
equivalent of US$12.5 million between November
2013 and February 2014—three months after the
disaster struck—in unconditional cash transfers
to existing beneficiaries of the national conditional cash transfer program, Pantawid. In addition, the existing Pantawid cash delivery
platform and national targeting systems helped
the World Food Programme and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) provide top-up
benefit amounts to Pantawid households in
affected areas. Emergency support was ­provided
for two months and included the activation of

previously agreed-on legislation to remove the
conditionalities of the regular program during
states of emergency (Bowen 2015).
In Fiji, following Tropical Cyclone Winston in
2016, the government disbursed F$19.9 million
(US$39.6 million) in the form of top-up grants
to beneficiaries of existing safety net programs,
in order to reach vulnerable groups and
inject much-needed liquidity into the economy.
A recent impact evaluation found that the
transfers were received in a timely fashion and
that those receiving the transfers recovered
faster than those who did not (Mansur, Doyle,
and Ivaschenko 2017).

BOX 5.3 Investing in Risk and Vulnerability Information and Tying It to Safety
Net Programming in the Dominican Republic, Kenya, and the Republic of Yemen
Kenya’s Hunger Safety Nets Program is an
unconditional, poverty-targeted cash transfer
program that can expand horizontally and vertically, acting as an emergency cash transfer in
times of drought. In response to drought events
specifically, the scaling up is determined by
objective triggers and thresholds in terms of
environmental deterioration, measured by a
Vegetation Condition Index. The predetermined triggers are used to set the benefit level
and the eligibility of households (NDMA 2016).
The Dominican Republic’s safety net
systems use a single beneficiary system called
SIUBEN, which contains socioeconomic and
demographic information on poor populations.
The information corresponds to a quality-of-life
index that determines beneficiary eligibility for
safety net programming. Recently, innovative
steps have integrated vulnerability with climate
change into SIUBEN. The integrated approach
estimates the probability of a household being
vulnerable to hurricanes, storms, and flooding,
given its socioeconomic characteristics; this

example, Decron and Clarke 2016). With
direct linkages to safety nets, risk financing
can mobilize funds quickly in support of the

The Emergence of Adaptive Social Protection

helps predict and map potential vulnerable
areas and coordinate disaster responses.
The Republic of Yemen used an adaptive
approach to respond to a humanitarian crisis
due to armed conflict. There, existing SSN and
social protection programs were reoriented to
help manage food insecurity, address the lack
of critical basic services, and deal with losses
of employment and livelihoods. The approach
introduced a conflict-sensitive monitoring
arrangement that uses GPS technology, realtime data flows, and third-party monitoring.
Targeting also complemented a poverty
approach with measures to identify conflictrelated vulnerabilities, such as internally
displaced people and their host communities,
female-headed households, and youth.
In addition, the allocation of assistance
adopted a conflict-sensitive approach, ensuring
predefined objectives as well as transparent
and data-based criteria that could translate
into a “distress index” and be used in a fundallocation formula.

in response to shocks, based on predefined
triggers for dispersal.
In summary, ASP is an emerging agenda in
the field of social protection. Given the sheer
degree of complexity associated with the issues
91

that ASP seeks to address—multiple risks and
shocks, vulnerability, uncertainty, and their
interconnectedness—a neat and comprehensive framing of all elements of the growing ASP
agenda is somewhat elusive. However, it is clear
in the current global context that social protection and SSN practitioners and policy makers
must begin to factor such issues into their
thinking more fully and undertake greater
­
­preparedness for shocks. ASP is a recognition
of this necessity. The approach outlined in this
chapter—building the resilience of the most
vulnerable before shocks occur, and increasing
the preparedness of SSNs to respond to the
shocks of the future—will likely serve to make
social protection more adaptive in the long
run, and enable it to more effectively protect
the well-being of the most vulnerable against
the impacts of all manner of shocks.

APPENDIX A

Methodological
Framework, Definitions,
and Data Sources
The Atlas of Social Protection: Indicators of
Resilience and Equity (ASPIRE) database of the
World Bank Group is the primary source of this
book. This appendix provides ASPIRE’s definitions, methodology, and data sources for generating public expenditure and performance
indicators. Further information is available in
Data Sources and Methodology of the ASPIRE
website.1
SOCIAL PROTECTION AND LABOR
PROGRAMS CLASSIFICATION
As discussed in Chapter 1, social protection
and labor (SPL) generally fall into three main
categories:
1. Social safety net (SSN)/social assistance (SA)
programs are noncontributory interventions
that are designed to help individuals and
households cope with chronic poverty,
destitution, and vulnerability. Potential
beneficiaries are not required to pay a
premium (contribute) to access benefits. SSN/
SA programs target the poor and vulnerable.
2. Social insurance is a contributory intervention
that is designed to help individuals manage
sudden changes in income due to old
age, sickness, disability, or natural disaster.
Individuals pay insurance premiums to
be eligible for coverage or contribute a
percentage of their earnings to an insurance
scheme to access benefits, which link to the

94

total years and amount of contributions.
Examples of social insurance programs
include contributory old-age, survivor, and
disability pensions; sick leave and maternity/
paternity benefits; and health insurance
coverage.
3. Labor market programs can be contributory
or noncontributory and are designed to help
protect individuals against loss of income
from unemployment (passive labor market
policies) or help individuals acquire skills
and connect them to labor markets (active
labor market policies). Unemployment
insurance and early retirement incentives
are examples of passive labor market
policies, while training, employment
intermediation services, and wage subsidies
are examples of active policies.
For cross-country comparability, this book
adheres to the ASPIRE harmonized classification of SPL programs. ASPIRE groups SPL programs into three program areas (social safety
nets social assistance, social insurance, and
labor markets) with 12 harmonized categories
based on program objectives. While Chapter 1
discusses the SSN/SA classification, the information in this appendix is more extensive.
This standardization is applied to each country in the ASPIRE database to generate comparable expenditure and performance indicators
(see table A.1).

DATA SOURCES
The ASPIRE dataset has two main sources of
information: administrative data and household survey data. The ASPIRE administrative database sources include primary and
secondary sources of data. Program-level
­administrative data are used to generate public expenditure indicators and the number of
beneficiaries.
Household survey data for 96 countries are
used to generate the performance indicators
(see appendix B for a full list of the surveys).
Those cover national representative surveys
with information on income, con­sumption,
and SPL programs, including the following:
Household Income and Expenditure/Budget
Surveys, Living Standard Measurement
Surveys, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys,
Surveys on Income and Living Conditions,
and Welfare Monitoring Surveys. The book
only uses the latest year for each country and
only if the data are not older than 2008; under
this criterion, 20 countries were excluded.
In addition, countries were excluded where
the surveys did not have social safety nets
information.
As of October of 2017, the ASPIRE administrative database included information on the
number of beneficiaries for 142 countries
(appendix C) and program-level spending data
for 124 countries (see appendix D).
96

DATA HARMONIZATION METHODOLOGY
Harmonization Methodology for
Administrative Data
The book uses only the latest year data available
for each country and only if the data are not
older than 2010. For four countries (Bhutan,
Jordan, Marshal Islands, and Vanuatu), the latest available year is 2009 and includes only total
SSN spending. To ensure comparability and
aggregation in spending across programs, the
book first divides program-level spending by
the corresponding year GDP for which the program data are available (only active/ongoing
programs are used). Overall spending for SSN
programs in the country is then approximated
by summing up all program shares as a percentage of GDP. For each country, the book then
provides the total SSN spending (as percentage of GDP), total spending without health fee
waivers (as a percentage of GPD), and the
spending (as a percentage of GDP) on the SSN/
SA specific component (see appendix D).
To calculate program expenditures, the book
considers all program spending no matter
whether it is government- or donor-financed.
When calculating averages (global or regional),
all countries are assumed to have equal weight
(in other words, simple averages are calculated).
Country GDP is taken from the World
Development Indicators database. Timor-Leste
data on GDP is taken from the World Economic
APPENDIXES

Outlook database. Average spending on SSNs
for member countries of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) (Hungary, Slovak Republic, and
Slovenia) and for OECD averages are based on
the OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX)
by combining “family” and “other social policy
functions” as the closest approximation to noncontributory safety nets, as defined in this book.
Harmonization Methodology for Household
Survey Data
Household surveys are reviewed to identify SPL
program information. Individual variables are
generated for each SPL program that is captured
in the survey; the individual variables are then
grouped into the 12 SPL harmonized program
categories. Performance indicators are generated using the harmonized program variables.

APPENDIXES

Household weights are used to expand the
results to the total population of each country.
For cross-country comparability, all monetary variables are expressed in 2011 prices
and daily purchasing power parity (PPP) in
U.S. dollars. The consumption or income aggregates used to rank households by their welfare
distribution are validated by the World Bank
regional poverty teams.
The book uses two definitions of poverty: relative poverty (individuals in the poorest
20 percent of the welfare distribution), and
absolute poverty (individuals living on less than
$1.90 purchasing power parity a day). Pretransfer welfare (income or consumption without the SPL transfer) is used to generate the
indicators by quintile, except for the adequacy
of benefits indicator; posttransfer welfare is
used to generate the adequacy indicator.

fewer than 10–15 (as in Bolivia, Croatia, and
Timor-Leste), whereas in high-number cases
there might be more than 50 programs (as in

Glossary
Term

Definition

Adequacy of benefits

The total transfer amount received by all beneficiaries in a quintile as a share of the total
welfare of beneficiaries in that quintile. Specifically, adequacy of benefits is the amount of
transfers received by a quintile divided by the total income or consumption of beneficiaries
in that quintile.

Average per capita transfer

For each beneficiary household, the per capita average transfer is estimated as the total
amount of transfers received divided by the household size.

Beneficiary incidence

Percentage of program beneficiaries in a quintile relative to the total number of
beneficiaries in the population. Specifically, the beneficiary incidence is the number of
individuals in each quintile who live in a household where at least one member participates
in a social protection and labor program divided by the number of individuals participating
in social protection and labor ­programs in the population.

Benefit–cost ratio

Reduction in poverty gap obtained for each US$1 spent on social protection and labor
programs. The indicator is estimated for the entire population and by program type.
Specifically, the benefit–cost ratio is estimated as the poverty gap before transfer minus the
poverty gap after transfer divided by the total transfer amount.

Benefit incidence

Percentage of benefits going to each group or quintile of the posttransfer (or pretransfer)
welfare distribution relative to the total benefits going to the population. Specifically,
benefit incidence is equal to the sum of all transfers received by all individuals in the
quintile divided by the sum of all transfers received by all individuals in the population.
The indicator usually includes both direct and indirect beneficiaries.

Coverage

Percentage of the population or population group participating in the social protection and
labor program. Specifically, coverage of a given group or quintile is the number of benefit
recipients in the group or quintile divided by the number of individuals in that quintile.
The coverage includes both direct and indirect beneficiaries.

Gini inequality reduction

Simulated change (percentage) in the Gini inequality ­coefficient because of social
protection and labor programs. Specifically, the Gini inequality reduction is computed as
the inequality pretransfer minus the inequality posttransfer divided by the inequality
pretransfer.

Poverty gap reduction

Simulated change (percentage) in poverty gap because of social protection and labor
programs. The poverty gap index is the average percentage shortfall in the income of the
poor. Specifically, the poverty gap reduction is computed as the poverty gap pretransfer
minus the poverty gap posttransfer divided by the poverty gap pretransfer.

Poverty headcount reduction

Simulated change (percentage) in the poverty headcount because of social protection and
labor programs. The poverty headcount ratio is the percentage of the population below the
poverty line. Specifically, the poverty headcount reduction is computed as the poverty
headcount pretransfer minus the poverty headcount posttransfer divided by the poverty
headcount pretransfer.

Program beneficiaries, number of

Number of program beneficiaries (households or individuals) as reported in administrative
data. The data indicate the original beneficiary unit (household or individual). For the
household-level benefit, the data also report the respective number of individuals
benefiting from the program. This information is presented in appendix C.

Program duplication and overlap

Percentage of beneficiaries who receive one or more benefits from different social
protection and labor programs.

Public expenditures

Total program expenditures, including spending on benefits and administrative costs. The
indicator captures both the recurrent and capital program budget and is usually based on
administrative program records. Program-level expenditures are presented as a percentage
of gross domestic product for the respective year, and is aggregated by harmonized social
safety net program categories. Total program expenditures without health fee waivers are
also presented.

T

he State of Social Safety Nets 2018 examines global trends in the social safety net/social assistance coverage,
spending, and program performance based on the World Bank Atlas of Social Protection: Indicators of

Resilience and Equity (ASPIRE) updated database. The book documents the main social safety net programs
that exist globally and their use to alleviate poverty and to build shared prosperity.
This 2018 edition expands on the 2015 version in administrative and household survey data coverage.
This edition is distinctive in that for the first time, it describes what happens with social safety
net/social assistance programs spending and coverage over time, when the data allow us to do so.
The State of Social Safety Nets 2018 also features two special themes—social assistance and aging, focusing on
the role of old-age social pensions; and adaptive social protection, focusing on what makes social safety net
systems and programs adaptive to various shocks.
